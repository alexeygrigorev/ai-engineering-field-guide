# AI Engineering Jobs Analysis

Generated from 895 job descriptions extracted from builtin.com.

I searched for jobs containing "AI Engineer" keyword from LA, NY, London, Amsterdam and Berlin for last 4 weeks. I did it at the beginning of February 2026, so it mostly contains jobs published in January 2026. 

Summary

- 70% of roles work directly on AI (RAG, agents)
- 93% need skills beyond just GenAI - it's a full-stack role
- 35.9% of roles mention RAG - the most common pattern in all jobs 
- AWS (359 jobs) > Azure (214 jobs) > GCP (205 jobs)

## Title Keywords vs Actual AI Type

I analyzed whether job titles accurately predict the actual work. Can you tell from a job title if someone works directly on AI or just supports AI work?

Title words that indicate support roles (infrastructure, platforms, data):

- Infrastructure - 14 jobs, 7.1% work on AI
- DevOps/SRE - 8 jobs, 12.5% work on AI
- Backend - 22 jobs, 27.3% work on AI
- Data Engineer - 21 jobs, 28.6% work on AI
- Platform - 83 jobs, 44.6% work on AI (still mostly support)

Title words that indicate AI roles (building models, RAG, agents):

- Full Stack - 47 jobs, 57.4% work on AI
- Product - 53 jobs, 62.3% work on AI
- Solutions - 24 jobs, 66.7% work on AI
- Research - 38 jobs, 76.3% work on AI

Common keywords in job titles:

In AI-first titles (621 titles):

- "ai" appears in 99.5% of titles
- "applied" appears in 10.8%
- "ml" appears in 9.7%
- "research" appears in 3.9%

In AI-support titles (255 titles):

- "platform" appears in 18.0% of titles
- "ml" appears in 11.8%
- "product" appears in 7.8%

Key insight: Title words like "Infrastructure", "DevOps", "SRE", "Backend", "Data Engineer" indicate support roles. "Research", "Solutions", "Product" indicate AI work.


## GenAI Framework Ecosystem

Framework popularity:

- LangChain - 168 jobs (18.8%)
- LangGraph - 72 jobs (8.0%)

Framework combinations (appearing together):

- LangChain + LangGraph - 53 jobs
- LangChain + LlamaIndex - 51 jobs
- CrewAI + LangChain - 23 jobs
- AutoGen + LangChain - 16 jobs
- LangGraph + LlamaIndex - 15 jobs

Key Insight: LangChain dominates, but LangGraph (agent orchestration) is growing. Most roles use one primary framework, not multiple.


## Core GenAI Skill Combinations

Most common GenAI skill pairs:

## Is AI-Support a Good Entry Point for Career Switchers?

Not necessarily. This analysis is for people switching careers into AI.

Key findings:

Entry-level AI-First roles: 3.2%

Entry-level AI-Support roles: 2.4%

Surprising insight: AI-Support roles are NOT more entry-level friendly for career switchers. They require strong infrastructure skills (Kubernetes, Docker, cloud) and often MORE web/devops experience than AI-First roles.

Good AI-Support entry paths for existing engineers:

- AI Platform roles (if you have K8s/cloud experience)
- AI Data Engineer (if you have data pipeline experience)
- Frontend for AI products (if you have React/TS experience)

Not ideal for AI beginners - you still need strong engineering skills, just different ones.

Key Insight: "AI Engineer" is the most common title (97% are AI-First). But job title alone isn't 100% reliable - always check responsibilities.


## How Much ML Do AI Engineers Need to Know?

64.3% of AI-First roles require some ML knowledge

Most common ML skills in AI Engineer roles:

- PyTorch - 165 jobs (26.6%)
- Fine-tuning - 159 jobs (25.6%)
- TensorFlow - 93 jobs (15.0%)
- Embeddings - 81 jobs (13.0%)
- Model training - 80 jobs (12.9%)
- Model evaluation - 69 jobs (11.1%)

Key Findings

1. Most AI Engineers need basic ML knowledge - 64% require some ML skills
2. Fine-tuning is the most common ML task - more common than model training from scratch
3. PyTorch dominates - 2.6x more common than TensorFlow for GenAI roles
4. Deep ML knowledge is rare - only ~8% expect general ML expertise

Bottom Line: AI Engineers need practical ML knowledge (PyTorch basics, fine-tuning, embeddings) but don't need deep ML expertise unless specifically working on model development.


## What Else (Besides GenAI) Do AI Engineers Need?

93.1% of AI-First roles require skills BEYOND just GenAI

Skill combinations in AI Engineer roles:

- GenAI + Ops (Docker, K8s, CI/CD) - 72.0%
- GenAI + ML skills - 57.5%
- GenAI + Web skills - 49.1%
- GenAI + ANY other tech - 93.1%
- Pure GenAI (nothing else) - 1.4%

Non-GenAI skills expected:

Cloud - AWS (41.7%), Azure (24.8%), GCP (22.2%) - Most expect one cloud platform

Ops - Docker (31.4%), CI/CD (27.7%), Kubernetes (26.6%) - Deployment is expected

Web - React (12.9%), FastAPI (12.9%) - About 50% do web work

Languages - Python (88.6%), TypeScript (23.3%), Java (15.1%) - Python is mandatory

Full-stack expectations:

- Frontend skills - 195/621 (31.4%)
- Backend skills - 308/621 (49.6%)
- Full-stack (both) - 134/621 (21.6%)

Bottom Line: AI Engineers are full-stack engineers who specialize in AI. Only 1.4% of roles expect pure GenAI work. Most need cloud deployment (AWS/Azure/GCP), containerization (Docker, K8s), CI/CD, and often web development (React, FastAPI).


## Fine-Tuning Requirements

30.8% of AI-First roles mention fine-tuning

Depth of fine-tuning expectation:

Primary FT responsibility - 25 jobs (4.0%) - FT is main focus (model architecture, LoRA, PEFT)

Secondary/occasional FT - 94 jobs (15.1%) - FT mentioned but not core

No FT mentioned - 502 jobs (80.8%) - No fine-tuning expected

Fine-tuning use cases:

Instruction following - 143 mentions

- Agents that follow complex instructions, task execution

Domain knowledge - 113 mentions

- Medical, legal, finance, industry-specific applications

Style/Tone - 53 mentions

- Brand voice, personality, formatting requirements

Company data - 35 mentions

- Internal documents, proprietary data

Performance - 32 mentions

- Smaller/faster models, latency optimization

Language - 24 mentions

- Multilingual, non-English support

Privacy - 10 mentions

- On-prem, offline, secure environments

Key Findings

1. Most AI Engineers don't fine-tune - Only ~20% have any FT expectation
2. Primary FT roles are rare - Only 4% focus on fine-tuning as main responsibility
3. Most common FT use case - Domain knowledge (medical, legal, finance) and instruction following for agents
4. FT is a specialization - Not a core AI Engineer skill, more advanced

Bottom Line: Fine-tuning is optional for most AI Engineers. Focus on RAG and agents first. Learn fine-tuning if targeting domain-specific roles (healthcare, finance, legal), performance optimization roles, or specialized model development.


## Key Insight 

Key Insight: RAG + Agents = 70%+ of use cases

The two dominant patterns are:

- RAG - Connect LLMs to your data (documents, databases)
- Agents - LLMs that use tools to accomplish tasks

If you learn these two patterns deeply, you can handle most AI Engineering use cases.


## Learning Path for AI Engineers

- LLM Basics - Prompt engineering, OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- RAG - Vector databases, embeddings, retrieval patterns
- Frameworks - LangChain or LlamaIndex
- Agents - LangGraph, agent orchestration
- Production - Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, monitoring


## AI Tech Stack

The typical AI engineering stack:

- APPLICATION layer - React, Next.js, FastAPI
- AI ORCHESTRATION layer - LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex
- LLM APIS layer - OpenAI, Anthropic, local models
- VECTOR DATABASES layer - Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector
