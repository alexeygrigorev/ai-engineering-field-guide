  About Blooming Health
  
  Blooming Health is a mission-driven, venture-backed health
  tech company transforming the social care landscape. We’re
  building an intelligent platform that helps people navigate
  and access the resources essential for holistic well-
  being—enabling CBOs, health systems, and health plans to
  deliver more effective and equitable care.
  
  The Opportunity
  
  We’re hiring an AI Engineer to help us design and build the
  systems that power our AI experiences—especially LLM-driven
  workflows, conversational patterns, and orchestration/agent
  layers. You’ll work closely with the Director of AI
  Engineering and product/engineering partners to ship
  reliable AI features into production, with strong attention
  to evaluation, data, and software quality.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Brainstorm and design AI orchestration patterns: how agents
    hand off, how state flows, how to handle uncertainty and
    edge cases.
  - Build and maintain our AI orchestration layer (Master OS,
    Engines, agent workflows).
  - Think through tradeoffs in prompt design, tool architecture,
    and conversation flow.
  - Design data pipelines that capture, transform, and surface
    insights from patient/member interactions.
  - Write clean, tested, production-ready Python (APIs,
    services, orchestration code).
  - Be a thought partner on technical direction—we’re building
    something new and need someone who enjoys solving hard
    problems together.
  
  What You’ll BringMUST HAVE
  
  AI / LLM Foundations
  
  - Hands-on experience with LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, or
    similar).
  - Understanding of prompt engineering patterns and
    limitations.
  - Familiarity with conversational AI / chatbot architectures.
  - Ability to reason about AI system design: when to use
    agents, how to structure workflows, how to handle
    uncertainty.
  
  Python Proficiency
  
  - Comfortable with async Python (asyncio, httpx, aioredis).
  - Experience building APIs and backend services.
  - Strong grasp of clean code principles and testing.
  
  Data Engineering Fundamentals
  
  - Strong SQL (PostgreSQL preferred).
  - Experience building ETL pipelines / data workflows.
  - Understanding of data modeling and schema design.
  
  Nice-to-Haves
  
  AI / LLM Depth
  
  - Orchestration patterns: multi-agent systems, tool use,
    function calling.
  - RAG, embeddings, retrieval systems.
  - Voice AI / real-time audio (Twilio, WebRTC, speech-to-text).
  - Familiarity with evaluation/testing strategies for AI
    systems.
  
  Data Engineering Depth
  
  - Streaming data (Kafka, event-driven architectures).
  - Orchestration tools (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster).
  - dbt or similar transformation frameworks.
  
  Healthcare Domain
  
  - Healthcare workflows, HIPAA considerations.
  - SDOH, care management, patient engagement experience.
  
  Infrastructure
  
  - Docker, Kubernetes, container orchestration.
  - Cloud platforms (GCP, AWS).
  
  Why Join Blooming Health?
  
  - Impact: Help improve access to social care and advance
    health equity.
  - Innovation: Build real AI systems that ship—agents,
    orchestration, data, and evaluation.
  - Growth: Take real ownership and grow fast with the product
    and team.
  - Team: Mission-driven people who move quickly and care about
    doing it right.
