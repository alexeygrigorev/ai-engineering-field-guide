  Intercom is the AI Customer Service company on a mission to help businesses provide incredible customer experiences. 
  
  Our AI agent Fin, the most advanced customer service AI agent on the market, lets businesses deliver always-on, impeccable customer service and ultimately transform their customer experiences for the better. Fin can also be combined with our Helpdesk to become a complete solution called the Intercom Customer Service Suite, which provides AI enhanced support for the more complex or high touch queries that require a human agent. 
  
  Founded in 2011 and trusted by nearly 30,000 global businesses, Intercom is setting the new standard for customer service. Driven by our core values, we push boundaries, build with speed and intensity, and consistently deliver incredible value to our customers.
  **What's the opportunity? **
  
  We’re looking for Staff Product Engineers to join the AI Group to build Intercom’s AI-powered products. Product Engineers working in ML work closely with both our ML Scientists and product teams. They must deeply understand our product, our customers, our ML tech stack and our broader product stack. 
  
  Our group is responsible for defining new ML features, researching appropriate algorithms and technologies, and rapidly getting first prototypes in our customers’ hands.
  
  We are an extremely product focussed team. We work in partnership with Product and Design functions of teams we support. Our team's dedicated Engineers enable us to move to production fast, often shipping to beta in weeks after a successful offline test.
  
  We are very passionate about applying machine learning technology, and have productized everything from classic supervised models, to cutting-edge unsupervised clustering algorithms, to novel applications of transformer neural networks. We test and measure the real customer impact of each model we deploy.
  
  If you are an experienced product engineer who takes an analytical approach to development and has some hands-on experience with ML systems, we'd love to hear from you!
