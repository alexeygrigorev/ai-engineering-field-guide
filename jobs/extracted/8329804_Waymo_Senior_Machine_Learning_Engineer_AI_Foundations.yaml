description: |
  Waymo is an autonomous driving technology company with the
  mission to be the world's most trusted driver. Since its
  start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo
  has focused on building the Waymo Driver—The World's Most
  Experienced Driver™—to improve access to mobility while
  saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. The
  Waymo Driver powers Waymo’s fully autonomous ride-hail
  service and can also be applied to a range of vehicle
  platforms and product use cases. The Waymo Driver has
  provided over ten million rider-only trips, enabled by its
  experience autonomously driving over 100 million miles on
  public roads and tens of billions in simulation across 15+
  U.S. states.
  
  The mission of the Waymo AI Foundations team is to develop
  machine learning solutions addressing open problems in
  autonomous driving, towards the goal of safely operating
  Waymo vehicles in dozens of cities and under all driving
  conditions. As part of our work, we also initiate and foster
  collaborations with other research teams in Alphabet. AI
  Foundations areas that we are currently focusing on include
  reinforcement learning, learning from demonstration,
  generative modeling, Bayesian inference, hierarchical
  learning, and robust evaluation.
  
  This role follows a hybrid work schedule and you will report
  to a Staff Research Scientist.
  
  You will:
  
  - Conduct applied foundation model research and development
  - Design compelling experiments by training and evaluating
    large deep learning models
  - Write high quality code, unit tests, and documentation
  - Collaborate with other teams to deploy models to production
  
  You have:
  
  - Masters or PhD in deep learning
  - Strong statistical / ML knowledge
  - Proficiency in Python
  - 3+ years of experience with modern deep learning frameworks:
    JAX, TensorFlow/PyTorch
  
  We prefer:
  
  - C++ experience
  - Proven track record of deploying ML models to production
    environments
  - Deep learning experience, especially with generative models,
    e.g., LLMs/VLMs, and/or reinforcement learning or
    imitation learning, transformer models, autoencoders and
    embeddings
  - Autonomous driving experience
  
  The expected base salary range for this full-time position
  is listed below. Actual starting pay will be based on job-
  related factors, including exact work location, experience,
  relevant training and education, and skill level.  Waymo
