  The Lead AI Engineer will drive the development of intelligent systems that extract and structure data from unstructured documents such as PDFs, scanned forms, and free-text content. This role will lead the design and deployment of advanced machine learning and generative AI solutions, with a particular emphasis on language models (SLM/LLMs) and their application to document understanding and data extraction at scale.
  
  **ESSENTIAL JOB RESPONSIBILITIES & KEY PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES**
  
  - Lead the architecture, development, and deployment of AI/ML systems for document ingestion, understanding, and data extraction. 
  
  - Build and create good datasets and a system of good validation and verifications of data and ML systems. 
  
  - Build and fine-tune LLMs and generative AI models to interpret, summarize, and extract information from complex unstructured content. 
  
  - Develop NLP pipelines leveraging techniques such as OCR, entity recognition, text classification, summarization, and semantic parsing. 
  
  - Integrate LLMs with retrieval systems (RAG), vector databases, and structured outputs suitable for downstream consumption. 
  
  - Collaborate cross-functionally to align technical solutions with product requirements and compliance needs. 
  
  - Mentor a team of AI/ML engineers, establish best practices in model training, evaluation, and monitoring. 
  
  - Stay abreast of the latest advancements in generative AI and apply cutting-edge techniques to real-world document challenges. 
  
  **REQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS **
  
  - Minimum of seven (7) years of experience in AI/ML engineering, with at least three (3) years in a technical or team leadership role 
  
  - Previous Technical Leadership in the AI/ML leadership space
  
  - Hands-on experience building and deploying S/LLMs or generative AI applications (e.g., using Llama, Deepseek or similar frameworks) 
  
  - Proven track record of extracting structured data from unstructured document sources, including scanned forms, free-text reports, and complex layouts 
  
  - Strong software engineering skills in Python and ML frameworks (e.g., Kubeflow, PyTorch, multi-agentic frameworks) 
  
  - Experience with OCR technologies (e.g., Tesseract, Amazon Textract), NLP techniques, and model deployment in production environments 
  
  - Deep understanding of NLP methods including embeddings, transformers, named entity recognition (NER), and text classification 
  
  - Familiarity with MLOps, version control, CI/CD, and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) 
  
  **PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS**
  
  - Experience implementing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), prompt engineering, or fine-tuning foundation models 
  
  - Familiarity with vector databases (e.g., Postgres-pg-vector, Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate) and semantic search 
  
  - Strong experience shipping production ML systems with a track record of monitoring and improving the ML systems 
  
  - Experience working in regulated domains such as healthcare, legal, or finance
