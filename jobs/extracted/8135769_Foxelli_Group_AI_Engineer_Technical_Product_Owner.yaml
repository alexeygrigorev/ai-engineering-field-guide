  Please be informed that Foxelli Group hires exclusively in-
  house and doesn't work with any external recruitment
  agencies. Any company or individual claiming to recruit on
  behalf of Foxelli Group is not affiliated with us.
  
  At Foxelli, we’re building more than e-commerce brands —
  we’re building a tribe of thoughtful humans: AI enthusiasts,
  curious builders, and ambitious minds who care about doing
  meaningful work together. Ten years in, our D2C brands reach
  millions and generate over $20M annually. Our focus stays
  simple: create products customers love and a team that
  actually enjoys building them.
  
  If you love to learn, experiment, think boldly, make
  decisions, and build things that matter — you’ll feel at
  home with us.
  
  WHY JOIN FOXELLI?
  
  Foxelli is a place for people who think deeply, learn
  quickly, automate repetitive work, enjoy spending time
  together, and build things that matter. We work hard, joke
  often, and don’t take ourselves too seriously.
  
  If you’re excited about AI, eager to learn, and want to
  create work that genuinely means something with people who
  care, you’ll feel right at home with us — no matter where
  you are in your career.
  
  THE ROLE
  
  We’re looking for an AI Engineer (Technical Product Owner)
  to help us build the system behind a new internal tool for
  Meta ads.
  
  This tool won’t just generate copy - it will learn from
  performance data, help our team test variations at scale,
  and get smarter over time. You’ll lead the technical side:
  designing the system, building the first version, and
  helping shape what it becomes.
  
  This role is a mix of product thinking and backend
  engineering. You’ll work closely with our founders and
  editors to solve real problems, make calls on what’s worth
  building, and create a system that actually helps us grow.
  
  RESPONSIBILITIES
  
  - Build the full backend for our internal AI ad engine.
  - Design how creative elements (hooks, angles, formats,
    personas) get combined, tested, and improved.
  - Set up clear feedback loops using Meta ad performance data.
  - Make decisions about structure: workflows, queues,
    callbacks, system logic.
  - Work with editors to understand what’s useful in day-to-day
    creative work.
  - Choose the right MVP path - build small, test fast, improve
    often.
  - Keep things simple and scalable as we grow.
  
  SKILLS & EXPERIENCE
  
  - Solid backend experience (Python, FastAPI or similar).
  - Experience building with LLMs and asynchronous systems.
  - A track record of launching usable tools (internal or SaaS).
  - Strong product judgment — you know when something’s worth
    building.
  - Comfort working independently, making decisions, and owning
    results.
  
  Bonus if you:
  
  - Have built tools for marketing, ads, or growth teams.
  - Know how Meta or TikTok ad workflows function.
  - Can explain a project you decided to stop — and why that was
    the right call.
  
  THE RECRUITMENT PROCESS
  
  - Apply - A simple form that helps us know who’s stepping into
    our world.
  - Ribbon AI Interview - Ribbon is a short, guided video step
    that helps us understand your thinking style in a calm,
    private space
  - Interview - A conversation with your manager to feel the
    work chemistry, get to know each other, and explore what
    we could build together
  
  FIXED SERVICE FEE
  
  We're open to discussing your compensation depending on your
  skills, competencies, and experience.
  
  ❕Please note that this role is based on a freelance
  agreement.
  
  PERKS & BENEFITS
  
  - Full flexibility with your schedule in a fully remote
    setting, while Hubstaff ensures transparency and fairness.
  - Complimentary gym memberships and company-sponsored outdoor
    adventures for your strength and to keep your physical
    well-being in check.
  - A personal development budget is at your disposal for your
    personal and professional growth to ensure you keep
    growing continuously.
  - Generous paid time off, including parental leave and
    vacation days, to recharge and rejuvenate and ensure
    you’re well-rested.
  - A budget for your home office setup so you’re comfortable
    working how you like and where you like.
  - Strong company culture and a network of unique individuals
    that celebrate you.
  
  ELIGIBILITY & LOCATION REQUIREMENTS
  
  ❕This role is 100% remote.
  
  - Our tribe works primarily in the Eastern European Time Zone
    (EET — UTC+2/UTC+3). We also use Revolut for payments, so
    we are open to hiring candidates in countries where
    Revolut payments are supported.
  - For full-time roles, we ask that you’re available for at
    least 5 hours during typical EET working hours — it keeps
    collaboration smooth and communication easy.(This doesn’t
    apply to part-time roles.)
  
  Currently, we are hiring in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina,
  Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Georgia, Kosovo,
  Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia,
  Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Malta, Slovenia,
  Serbia, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Hungary, Netherlands, the United
  Kingdom, and South Africa.
