  - **Hands-on experience building and optimizing AI/ML inference runtimes (e.g., KServe, TorchServe, TensorRT, Triton) and integrating with CI/CD and MLOps pipelines (e.g., SageMaker, Kubeflow, BentoML).**
  
  - **Expertise in JavaScript/TypeScript, with additional experience in Golang or Kotlin.**
  
  - Experience with containers, orchestration (Kubernetes/ECS), cloud platforms (AWS preferred), and distributed systems.
  
  - Experience with performance profiling, model optimization, GPU acceleration, and designing inference workloads to meet latency/throughput SLAs.
  
  - Experienced in building scalable APIs (REST/gRPC), caching strategies, and high-performance systems, including relational and NoSQL databases.
  
  - Familiar with monitoring, observability tools, security, and compliance best practices in production ML/AI services.
  
  - Proven ability to collaborate with ML/AI teams, bridge research and production, and mentor peers.
