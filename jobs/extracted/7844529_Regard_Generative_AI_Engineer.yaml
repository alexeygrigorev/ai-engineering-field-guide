description: |
  As a Generative AI Engineer at Regard, you’ll work across
  the full lifecycle of developing and deploying AI-driven
  features, from ideation and design to prototyping,
  implementation, evaluation, and iteration. You’ll
  collaborate closely with product and clinical teams to build
  systems that transform medical records into structured
  insights and clinician-ready documentation.
  
  Your work will center on applying modern LLMs to extract,
  summarize, normalize, and generate clinical information from
  diverse electronic health record (EHR) data sources. This
  includes developing robust pipelines, running model and
  prompt-engineering experiments, integrating models into
  production services, and ensuring outputs remain factual,
  safe, and clinically aligned.
  
  You’ll directly contribute to high-priority product
  initiatives, shape new AI capabilities, and advance our LLM
  platform. Your work will have a tangible impact on how
  clinicians understand patient data and how healthcare
  organizations improve care quality.
  
  About Regard
  
  Our mission is to bring world-class healthcare to everyone.
  Regard is an AI-powered Proactive Documentation platform
  that advances how care is delivered by reviewing all patient
  data in the EHR to recommend diagnoses and surface clinical
  evidence. Regard drafts a note even before the physician
  sees the patient, enabling an approach that gets
  documentation right at the point of care - we call it
  Proactive Documentation. This improves quality of care,
  reduces physician burden, and improves hospital finances. We
  are excited by challenges, mission-oriented work, and
  meaningful relationships. We work closely with some of the
  top health systems in the country and are leading the change
  that healthcare - one of the largest and most inefficient
  industries in the world - needs. We want you to join us.
