  **Software Engineer**
  
  **Remote (U.S. time zones)**
  **About Wolf Games**
  
  Wolf Games is building the platform for generative entertainment universes — living, ever-expanding worlds where creators, players, and AI collaborate in real time. Our first universe, Public Eye, turns everyone into a detective. Across a suite of crime-solving games, players collect evidence, crack cases, and rise through the ranks of a connected detective program. We're creating a future where game development and player experience are tightly connected through intelligent systems that learn, adapt, and surprise.
  **About the role**
  
  We're looking for a Software Engineer to turn promising prototypes into polished, production-ready games. This is a role for someone who can take the creative spark from our rapid prototyping pipeline and build it into robust, scalable systems that ship to players across our growing portfolio of titles.
  
  You will own the journey from prototype to production. You'll build the shared infrastructure and game systems that provide value across all of our titles, then adapt and extend them for each new game we launch. You'll work with modern AI-assisted development workflows to move fast without sacrificing quality, and you'll help define the technical patterns that let a small team punch above its weight.
  
  This isn't siloed feature work — you'll touch every layer of our games, from core gameplay systems to platform integrations to the tooling that accelerates our entire team. You'll think holistically about how the code you write today enables the games we'll build tomorrow.
  
  You will report to the CTO and work closely with engineering, design, and creative leadership to:
  
  - Take validated prototypes from concept stage to production-ready games, refactoring exploratory code into maintainable, performant systems.
  
  - Build and maintain shared game infrastructure — progression systems, save/load, analytics integration, platform APIs — that accelerates development across all titles.
  
  - Adapt core systems to the unique requirements of each new game, balancing reusability with the flexibility to support diverse gameplay experiences.
  
  - Collaborate with the Creative Engineer to establish clear technical handoff processes, ensuring promising prototypes have a smooth path to production.
  
  - Leverage AI-assisted development tools to accelerate implementation while maintaining code quality and architectural coherence.
  
  - Integrate with distribution platforms, ad networks, and third-party services to maximize reach and revenue across our portfolio.
  
  - Identify opportunities to extract reusable components from production games back into shared libraries, continuously improving our development velocity.
  
  - Contribute to technical decision-making around architecture, tooling, and process as we scale our game portfolio.
  **What you'll bring**
  - 3+ years of experience building and shipping web-based games or interactive experiences, with strong proficiency in TypeScript/JavaScript.
  
  - Hands-on experience with modern web game frameworks (Pixi.js, Phaser, Three.js) and a deep understanding of browser performance optimization.
  
  - Fluency with AI-assisted development workflows — you use tools like Claude, Copilot, or similar to accelerate your work and are excited about where this is heading.
  
  - A track record of building systems that scale across multiple products or projects, with an eye for the right level of abstraction.
  
  - Experience integrating with platform APIs, analytics services, ad networks, or other third-party systems in a production context.
  
  - Strong fundamentals in software architecture, with the judgment to know when to build for reuse and when to ship fast.
  
  - Comfort working across the stack — you can debug a gameplay feel issue as readily as a backend integration problem.
  
  - Excellent collaboration skills, with experience working closely with designers, artists, and product stakeholders.
  
  - A pragmatic, ownership-oriented mindset — you care about shipping great games, not just writing elegant code.
  **Nice to have**
  - Experience with real-time multiplayer, leaderboards, or social features in web games.
  
  - Familiarity with cloud infrastructure (GCP, AWS) and CI/CD pipelines for web deployments.
  
  - Background in mobile web or hybrid app development.
  
  - Experience working in a fast-paced startup or small studio environment.
  **Why Wolf Games**
  
  We are a small, creative, and collaborative team that values curiosity, craftsmanship, and experimentation. We believe small wins lead to big wins — and that the right systems, built by the right people, can let a small team create an outsized portfolio of great games. If you're excited to build the foundation for a new kind of game studio, we'd love to hear from you.
