  Opportunity
  
  In 2025, tools like Cursor, Devin, and Claude gave engineers
  superpowers, allowing them to ship faster than ever before.
  But for the rest of the world — Sales, Ops, Marketing, and
  Finance — work largely hasn't changed. They're still
  drowning in Slack threads, manual data entry, and "good
  enough" ChatGPT responses.
  
  We're here to fix that.
  
  Vellum is building the platform where anyone can describe a
  goal in plain language and generate reliable, working agents
  in seconds (think "Lovable for agents" and "Devin for
  everyone else").
  
  Our Values
  
  We're a high-performance team in one of the most competitive
  software markets of all time, so we're looking for S-tier
  builders who align with our core values:
  
  Lean into the future
  
  We don't just build AI tools; we live in the future.
  
  - We use AI tools (Cursor, Claude, etc.) extensively in our
    daily workflows.
  - We skate to where the puck is going. You should be excited
    to build what customers need before they even ask for it.
  - We cut the right corners to go fast, but we build our
    products and processes for the long run.
  
  Say what you mean; mean what you say
  
  We operate in an extremely high-trust environment.
  
  - We speak openly and honestly, even when it's hard.
  - We receive feedback without getting defensive.
  - If we say we're going to do something, we do it. If we can't
    keep a commitment, we communicate it immediately.
  
  Play to win
  
  There are going to be huge companies built in this space,
  and we're going to be one of them. We've raised $25M from
  top-tier investors and we intend to spend it aggressively to
  win this market. In other words, we're swinging for the
  fences.
  
  - We love winning and know it won't be easy. This means we
    move extremely fast, make sacrifices, and do whatever it
    takes.
  - We demand executional excellence from ourselves and each
    other.
  - We push ourselves hard to maximize long-term output and are
    resilient to burnout.
  
  Who You Are
  
  - You've founded or worked at an early-stage startup.
  - You have deep experience building coding agents or other
    complex AI systems.
  - You're not a researcher - you're an engineer applying AI in
    the real world.
  - You're an early adopter of AI tools that make you more
    effective.
  - You're ready to build alongside us in our New York office.
  - You crave ownership and are ready to take on significant
    responsibility from Day 1.
  - You're excited to build the tools that will redefine how
    people work.
  
  If this sounds like you, welcome home.
  
  Let's get to work.
