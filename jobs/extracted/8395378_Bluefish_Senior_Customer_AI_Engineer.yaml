  **About the Position:**
  
  Bluefish is looking for a technically strong, customer-facing Senior Customer AI Engineer to support enterprise customers throughout their AI Marketing efforts—from implementation and integration through optimization and expansion. This role sits at the intersection of account management, AI solutioning, and technical delivery.
  
  You will act as a trusted technical partner for customers, ensuring smooth transitions from sales to account ownership, supporting complex integrations, and helping customers unlock measurable value from Bluefish’s AI platform. The ideal candidate is equally comfortable discussing APIs and data pipelines as they are explaining AI-driven outcomes to non-technical stakeholders.
  
   
  
  **What You'll Be Doing**
  
  - Support the technical relationship for assigned customer accounts, serving as the primary point of contact for integrations, configurations, and advanced technical questions.
  
  - Support RFP and RFI responses, expanding technical sections and helping streamline internal processes for scale and consistency.
  
  - Guide and support customer integrations, including APIs, data feeds, product catalogs, and other platform dependencies.
  
  - Design and support custom technical solutions, such as dashboards, data exports, and bespoke workflows tailored to customer needs.
  
  - Partner with customers on complex optimization measurement, automation, and performance validation to ensure measurable business impact.
  
  - Collaborate closely with product, engineering, sales, and customer success to surface customer feedback and inform roadmap priorities.
  
  - Help identify opportunities for account expansion and deeper platform adoption through technical use cases and optimization strategies.
  
   
  
  **Qualifications**
  
  - Minimum of 5+ years of experience in a Technical Account Manager, Solutions Engineer, Customer Engineer, or similar client-facing technical role, ideally in SaaS, AI, or marketing technology.
  
  - Strong hands-on experience with APIs, data feeds, and system integrations.
  
  - Solid AI and AI/ML proficiency, with the ability to clearly explain complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
  
  - Working knowledge of databases, data management, and analytics concepts.
  
  - Proven ability to drive value and adoption in Fortune 500 or global enterprise accounts.
  
  - Comfortable operating in ambiguous environments and building or improving processes as the company scales.
  
  - Exceptional communication skills-written, verbal, and visual-with the ability to engage stakeholders at all levels.
  
  - A consultative, customer-first mindset with a track record of delivering outcomes.
  
  - Comfort working in fast-paced, startup environments with cross-functional collaboration.
