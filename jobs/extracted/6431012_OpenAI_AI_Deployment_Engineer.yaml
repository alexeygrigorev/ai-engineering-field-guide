We act as trusted advisors and technical partners to our customers, helping them build and execute their AI adoption strategy post-sale. Our mission is to develop a strong backlog of GenAI use cases tailored to each customer’s industry and to drive these initiatives from prototype to production through hands-on technical guidance and partnership.
  
  As an AI Deployment Engineer, you will help customers across various industries transform their businesses through applications such as customer service automation, content generation, and entirely new offerings powered by our most advanced models.

  You will take a holistic view of each customer’s architecture and operations, designing solutions that leverage ChatGPT, OpenAI APIs, and our broader ecosystem of tools and services. You will work cross-functionally with Sales, Solutions Engineering, Applied Research, and Product teams, and report to the Head of Solutions Architecture for your segment.

  Have experience leading complex deployments of Generative AI or traditional machine learning systems, ideally including infrastructure and network architecture considerations.
  
  - 
  
  Possess hands-on proficiency in languages like Python, JavaScript, or similar, and are comfortable building prototypes or proofs of concept.
  
  - 
  
  Take end-to-end ownership of challenges, proactively acquiring new skills or knowledge as needed to drive success.
