  **About Supernal**
  
  At Supernal, we help SMBs hire their first AI employee. Our AI teammates are built with intelligent, agentic workflows and deployed on our proprietary platform, with orchestration powered by N8n. We don’t build tools—we deliver working, value-generating AI Employees.
  
  Our AI Platform Engineers, known internally as Masons, are the builders behind these systems. Now, we’re looking for a Senior Mason to help lead this craft.
  
  **The Role**
  
  As a Junior AI Platform Engineer, you’ll be on the frontlines of our most critical client implementations. You’ll design and build intelligent agentic workflows that power real business outcomes. But your role goes far beyond individual contribution.
  
  This is a hands-on role. You’re not just reviewing PRs or sitting in meetings—you’re in the weeds, building systems, solving gnarly edge cases, and showing others how it’s done.
  
  **Responsibilities**
  
  - 
  
  Build advanced AI agent workflows on N8n and Supernal’s proprietary platform
  
  - 
  
  Lead engineering delivery for our highest-priority customers
  
  - 
  
  Own technical architecture decisions for agentic systems, including tool usage, RAG design, API orchestration, and task decomposition
  
  - 
  
  Define, document, and evolve our engineering best practices
  
  - 
  
  Review technical work for quality, scalability, and maintainability
  
  - 
  
  Contribute to internal tooling and system improvements that accelerate agent deployment
  
  **You Might Be a Fit If You…**
  
  - 
  
  Have 4+ years of experience as a software engineer, automation engineer, or technical systems builder
  
  - 
  
  Have deep experience with agentic architectures, workflow automation platforms (N8n, Zapier, Make), and APIs
  
  - 
  
  Understand prompt engineering, function-calling, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and LLM orchestration
  
  - 
  
  Are passionate about systems thinking and designing workflows that can scale
  
  - 
  
  Are an elite debugger and systems optimizer—you can reason through edge cases, flakey agents, and API chaos
  
  - 
  
  Can balance hands-on work with technical leadership
  
  - 
  
  Are comfortable in a fast-paced, ambiguous startup environment and thrive under autonomy
  
  - 
  
  Have a low-ego, high-integrity approach to team collaboration
  
  **What Success Looks Like**
  
  - 
  
  Supernal’s AI Employees are consistently high-performing, robust, and scalable
  
  - 
  
  Our technical best practices are living, documented, and widely adopted
  
  - 
  
  Engineering quality improves even as the team rapidly scales
