  **An overview of this role**
  
  As a Staff Fullstack Engineer on the AI Engineering Duo Chat group, you’ll build and evolve the core AI capabilities that power GitLab Duo Chat, helping customers work faster and more securely across the GitLab platform. You’ll boost AI functionality, integrate major providers like Google Vertex AI, and shape the product roadmap by designing new tools and strengthening testing, quality, and performance. Working across Ruby on Rails, Python, JavaScript, and Vue.js, you’ll collaborate closely with product management and specialists across frontend, backend, and UX to deliver secure, well-tested, and reliable features that meaningfully improve the developer experience.
  
  Some examples of our projects:
  
  - Integrating new generative AI models and providers into GitLab Duo Chat to expand capabilities and improve response quality
  
  - Improving debugging, observability, and test coverage for AI-powered chat workflows to increase reliability at scale
  **What you’ll do**
  - Develop, ship, and maintain features and improvements for GitLab Duo Chat across the full stack in a secure, well-tested, and performant way
  
  - Collaborate with Product Management, UX, frontend, backend, and AI specialists to refine requirements and deliver high-quality, iterative product enhancements
  
  - Integrate and extend AI capabilities, including large language models and providers such as Google Vertex AI, into GitLab’s Ruby on Rails and Python-based services
  
  - Design, implement, and review GraphQL APIs and related backend logic, ensuring reliability, scalability, and clear contracts with frontend clients
  
  - Craft clean, maintainable Python and JavaScript/Vue.js code, and uphold engineering standards through thoughtful code reviews and technical guidance to the team
  
  - Improve and extend automated testing, including RSpec and other frameworks, to strengthen quality, reliability, and developer feedback loops
  
  - Identify, prioritize, and address technical debt and performance or optimization issues, driving improvements that make the system more stable and efficient
  
  - Participate in Tier 2 on-call rotations to troubleshoot production issues, contribute to root cause analysis, and enhance observability and resiliency
  **What you’ll bring**
  - Professional experience building and maintaining production services with Python, including debugging, testing, and performance optimization
  
  - Experience in frontend development using JavaScript and modern frameworks such as Vue.js or React
  
  - Familiarity with AI technologies and generative AI systems, with exposure to GitLab Duo Chat or similar AI-powered chat products
  
  - Working knowledge of GraphQL and RSpec, or willingness to learn comparable tools and testing frameworks
  
  - Ability to write secure, well-tested, and maintainable code across the stack in a high-scale web environment
  
  - Comfortable working in a highly agile, iterative, and largely asynchronous remote setting, taking ownership as a “manager of one”
  
  - Strong communication and collaboration skills, able to work closely with product management and cross-functional engineering partners
  
  - Openness to learning, transferable skills, and diverse technical backgrounds aligned with GitLab’s values and all-remote culture
  **About the team**
  
  The Duo Chat team sits within GitLab’s AI Engineering organization and is responsible for building and evolving GitLab Duo Chat, the AI-powered chat experience embedded across the GitLab DevSecOps platform. You’ll work with a small, cross-functional group of backend, frontend, and AI specialists who collaborate asynchronously across time zones, using GitLab issues, merge requests, and documentation as the primary way of working. We focus on integrating and scaling generative AI capabilities (including providers like Google Vertex AI), improving reliability and performance, and strengthening debugging and testing workflows so GitLab customers can safely use AI to plan, write, review, and secure their code.
