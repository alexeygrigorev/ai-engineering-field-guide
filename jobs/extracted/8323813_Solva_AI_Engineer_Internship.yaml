  About Solva
  
  Solva is building AI for insurers to transform an $8
  trillion industry, starting with claims. We’re backed by $6m
  from First Round, Y Combinator, SV Angel and angel
  investors, including Paul Graham, that have funded companies
  such as OpenAI, Google, Stripe, Anthropic, Databricks and
  Github. We have an advisory board of experienced insurance
  executives and founders.
  
  Our team was previously part of building Europe’s fastest
  growing InsurTech and founded a licensed EU bank processing
  payments of €1B/yr+. Now we are taking on one of the world’s
  largest industries and rebuilding it from the ground up with
  AI.
  
  Solva is a Y Combinator S25 company and has emerged as one
  of the fastest growing and best-funded startups.
  
  About the role
  
  As an AI Engineering Intern you will work closely with the
  founders and contribute to the core AI systems that power
  Solva. You will learn by working on real problems across
  reasoning, evaluation, data and model behavior, and help us
  improve how claims decisions are made. The work is hands on
  and fast moving.
  
  You will experiment with models, build evaluation tools,
  refine agent workflows and work with challenging real world
  insurance data. This is a role for someone who is curious,
  enjoys solving technical problems and wants to work in a
  fast paced environment where ideas turn into product
  quickly.
  
  Internship is full time. Start period can be discussed.
  Successful internships can lead to full time roles.
  
  What you’ll do
  
  - Work on the AI systems behind claims decision support and
    reasoning
  - Work on agent workflows, evaluation pipelines, retrieval
    logic and prompt strategies
  - Experiment with LLMs, fine tuning, RAG, embeddings and model
    selection
  - Stress test outputs, break them, fix them and learn about
    engineering robust systems
  - Ship fast, iterate with customers and turn messy problems
    into clean solutions
  - Work on internal tools, dashboards and analysis frameworks
    that support our core product
  
  What we’re looking for
  
  - Strong interest in building with LLMs and working with real
    world data
  - Someone who enjoys digging into complex problems, testing
    ideas and making things actually work
  - Eagerness to own projects
  - Not afraid of messy data, ambiguity or figuring things out
    from first principles
  - Curiosity driven mindset, willing to read papers and try
    unconventional approaches
  - Bonus if you have built your own AI projects, agents or
    research experiments
  - Builder mentality. Move fast. Think clearly. Take ownership.
