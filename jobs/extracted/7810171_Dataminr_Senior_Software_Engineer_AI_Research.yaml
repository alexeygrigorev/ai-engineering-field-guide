  See yourself at Dataminr
  
  As a Senior AI Engineer, you will work closely with our
  Research Scientists and Data Scientists to train, build,
  adapt, optimize, and deploy state-of-the-art LLMs in
  Predictive AI, Generative AI and Agentic AI applications.
  You will work on solving some of the most challenging
  problems in AI while building large-scale solutions that
  save lives. In this role, you’ll work closely with multiple
  teams in the AI Platform organization to deploy Agents and
  LLMs that improve state-of-the-art performance across
  multimodal data (text, images, videos, audio, and sensor
  data), in our very large scale platform (processing billions
  of inputs per day). You will be expected to continuously
  learn and expand your knowledge in both AI and Software
  Engineering, utilizing and improving on the latest tools and
  techniques for LLM training and adaptation to leverage our
  large-scale proprietary data, compute and platform
  infrastructure, and domain expert input. This US-based role
  can be remote or based out of our New York City office.
  
  AI Innovation at Dataminr
  
  Working at Dataminr you’ll have the opportunity to tackle
  the most exciting trends in AI on a daily basis to power a
  revolutionary product that uncovers critical events around
  the world as they unfold.
  
  Regenerative AI: our AI technology, ReGenAI, is a new form
  of generative AI that automatically regenerates real-time
  Live Event Briefs as events unfold. Learn more here.
  
  Agentic AI: we recently launched our Agentic AI capability,
  what we’re calling our Intel Agents, that autonomously
  generates critical context for our clients on real-time
  events, threats, and risks allowing them to see the
  clearest, most accurate view of what’s happening on the
  ground. Learn more here
  
  Multimodal AI: our platform detects events from many
  different types of data (images, video, sensor data, audio,
  and text in over 150 languages). Learn more here.
  
  The opportunity
  
  - Work with groups of Research Scientists, Engineers, and Data
    Scientists in the AI Platform organization and beyond, to
    deploy, build, adapt, optimize, and deploy LLM models in
    production at very large scale.
  - Own the technical design and implementation of robust API
    services, libraries, and container strategies that define
    and support our end-to-end LLMOps lifecycle.
  - Optimize DL/LLM training and inference performance
    (speed/cost) on specialized hardware.
  - Drive the full lifecycle of complex AI problems: from
    initial research and literature review to hands-on data
    exploration, implementation of novel, in-house methods,
    and successful productization.
  
  What you bring
  
  At Dataminr, we value you for who you are. We encourage you
  to apply for this role, even if you don’t meet every
  qualification. Our candidates are reviewed on the basis of
  their skill and potential to succeed.
  
  - M.S. in Computer science or equivalent experience
  - 5+ years of experience as a Research or Machine Learning
    Engineer.
  - MLOps/LLMOps Experience: building, optimizing, deploying and
    operating Deep Learning models using PyTorch, including
    Transformers and LLMs, not just using APIs.
  - Experience working with Research Scientists, reading
    technical research papers, and implementing state-of-the-
    art methods in Natural Language Processing, Computer
    Vision, Knowledge Representation and Management, Vector
    Databases and Generative AI.
  - Expertise in Python.
  - Experience with Containers, Kubernetes, AWS, Databricks, and
    Agentic infra such as LangGraph, LangFuse, and vector
    stores
