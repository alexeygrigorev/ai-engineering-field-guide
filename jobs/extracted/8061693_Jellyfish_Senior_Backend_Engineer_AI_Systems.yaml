  Engineers do their best work when they can focus on what
  matters most. Leaders want to help teams set clear
  priorities. It's hard to know where people are working in
  large systems when issue tracking systems are messy.
  Jellyfish's engineering team is solving this problem for
  every issue tracking system and any style of working. We're
  looking for a Senior Backend Engineer, AI Systems who wants
  to build tools that classify work into meaningful categories
  so leaders can see patterns and help their teams focus on
  what matters.
  
  This role demands someone who can handle complex data at
  scale. You'll work across multiple issue tracking systems,
  each with different data models and quirks, processing
  millions of issues for hundreds of customers. You need to
  design systems that can classify and aggregate work
  efficiently, build data pipelines that handle the volume,
  and apply LLMs in ways that work at scale. Strong backend
  engineering skills, experience with complex data modeling,
  and curiosity about building production LLM systems and AI
  infrastructure are essential.
  
  The best candidates are senior backend engineers who enjoy
  working with unstructured data, want to learn about using AI
  infrastructure responsibly, and care about building features
  that help engineering leaders make better decisions for
  their teams.
  
  Let's talk about what you'll do:
  
  - Design, plan, and implement key features as part of a highly
    effective development team
  - Rapidly deliver value for our customers by pushing features
    to our AWS-hosted SaaS environment daily, with automated
    CI/CD pipelines
  - Provide technical and product expertise within your team and
    across the organization
  - Think big about what’s possible to represent the scope of
    engineering work and how it’s changing
  - Communicate effectively about project status and technical
    issues
  - Participate in your team’s agile process and work to
    continually improve your team’s capabilities
  - Provide support for production operations of the Jellyfish
    product
  - Actively participate in a culture supportive of growth and
    inclusion on your team
  
  Let's talk about what you need to excel:
  
  - 10+ years of experience building SaaS products
  - Strong skills in Python, and passion for building production
    software systems
  - Enough experience with frontend frameworks, such as React,
    to be able to pitch in from time to time to move a project
    forward or troubleshoot issues.
  - Strong skills in data modeling in relational database
    systems and experience with and interest in other database
    technologies such as columnar systems.
  - Experience working with Large Language Models and Amazon’s
    Bedrock and Sagemaker environments.
  - Fluency with tools such as Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code,
    Kiro and a track record of using them to build and ship
    fast.
  - Have worked in or interested in a growth-stage startup
  - Curiosity - great at asking questions, figuring out what
    needs to be done, building consensus, and executing
  - Love learning new things and teaching others what you know
  - Strong communication skills and desire for collaborative
    work
  
  A list of job experiences and qualification requirements is
  great, but humility, a performance-driven attitude, and a
  team-player approach are most important to us. We love to
  have fun and win in the process. We only hire people who
  have a passion for building great companies in an
  environment where a sense of humor is a must.
  
  Occasional travel may be required.
  
  Applicants must be authorized to work for any employer in
  the US. We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of
  an employment visa at this time.
  
  Let’s talk about us! This is all about you, but you want to
  know a little about us. Jellyfish enables leaders to
  effectively build AI-integrated engineering teams, align
  engineering decisions with business initiatives and deliver
  the right software efficiently and on time. AI tools alone
  won’t transform your org—Jellyfish shows you what’s working,
  what’s not, and how to build high-performing teams that know
  how to use AI the right way.
