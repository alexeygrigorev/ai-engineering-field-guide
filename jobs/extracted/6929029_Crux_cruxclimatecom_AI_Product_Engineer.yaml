  We’re supercharging the clean economy
  
  Crux is the capital markets platform changing the way clean
  energy and manufacturing projects are financed in the U.S.
  Crux’s capital markets platform, software platform, market
  intelligence, and expert team help developers and
  manufacturers unlock financing.
  
  Our team of 65+ is composed of experts in renewable energy,
  project & corporate finance, tax equity and tax credits,
  policy, and technology and AI.
  
  We have raised $77 million in capital from some of the best
  venture and strategic investors, including Andreessen
  Horowitz, Lowercarbon Capital, New System Ventures, Ardent
  Venture Partners, Pattern, Clearway, EDFR, Intersect, LS
  Power, Orsted, Hartree Partners, Liberty Mutual Strategic
  Ventures, MassMutual Ventures, and OMERS Ventures.
  
  An inflection point in American energy and manufacturing
  
  Energy demand is growing for the first time in 20 years,
  driven by surging manufacturing, transportation,
  electrification, and data centers. Simultaneously, hundreds
  of billions of dollars are being invested in domestic supply
  chains for critical minerals and components. Developers and
  manufacturers will require trillions of dollars in capital
  to meet growing needs.
  
  Before Crux, the capital markets supporting this
  transformation remained opaque, fragmented, and complex. At
  Crux, we recognized the missing infrastructure: a central
  capital markets platform designed specifically for the next
  century of American energy and industry. We unlock faster
  decision making, lower cost of capital, and accelerated
  investment.
  
  About the role
  
  The traditional process for financing clean energy is
  manual, opaque, and slow. We’ve built products that solve
  part of that problem — now we’re expanding their breadth and
  depth with AI. We’re hiring our first AI Product Engineer to
  work hand-in-hand with customers, product, commercial, and
  legal teams to reimagine the way transactions happen in
  clean energy finance, starting with diligence.
  
  You won’t just be building features — you’ll be co-designing
  the processes and systems that define how we ship high-
  quality AI products at Crux.
  
  Much of this framework doesn’t exist yet — and you’ll help
  invent it using first principles.
  
  What you'll do
  
  - Collaborate directly with customers
  - Build products from 0 -> 1
  - Pick the tools & frameworks we use
  - Learn an insane amount about the nuts & bolts of clean
    energy finance
  - Raise the bar for our engineering culture
  
  What we’re looking for
  
  - 4+ years of full-stack software engineering experience and
    you can build products end-to-end (frontend + backend)
    - Bonus: fluency in NextJS + React + Typescript stack
    - Also bonus: you are comfortable making UX decisions
  - Proven experience building and shipping user-facing LLM
    products
    - Bonus: you have iterated on a product through evals & CI/CD
  - Ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment
    - Bonus: you love working at startups
  - Excellent communication skills (oral & written)
    - Bonus: also excellent at communicating with AI (prompting)
  
  You might excel if you...
  
  - Enjoy hackathons & building side projects
  - Have experience building AI agents that work
  - Previously founded a startup OR worked at a rocket ship
  - Love taking products from 0 -> 1
  - Can do most things in half the time that most people think
    possible
  - Can quickly find the 80/20 solution and move on
  - Can unblock yourself and rally others

  - Backing, traction & brand:
    - We have raised $77 million in capital from some of the best

      to your day and your clients’ experience.
    - Regular team offsites: We sustain culture by bringing the
      entire company together 3 times a year. Individual teams
      may also meet up more frequently.

      - Care for each other: We want to work on a team where people
        support each other - in their growth, in their work,
        and towards our shared mission. When we do that, we
        have fun.
      - Build and improve rapidly: We move quickly. To do that, we
        focus, consistently ask ourselves if we are
        prioritizing the right things, and execute them as
        best as possible.
      - Focus unremittingly on customers: Our first obligation is to
        our customers and partners, and we keep their needs
        front and center in everything we do.
