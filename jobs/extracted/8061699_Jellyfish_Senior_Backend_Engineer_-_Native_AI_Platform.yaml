  Jellyfish's Engineering team is building our Native AI
  future. We're looking for a senior backend engineer who
  wants to build the infrastructure that powers AI agents for
  engineering leaders.
  
  You'll join the team transforming our platform from
  traditional SaaS to Native AI SaaS. Your job is to build the
  backend systems that let our agentic chat access data across
  the entire Jellyfish platform, process it at scale, and
  deliver expert insights to engineering leaders. This means
  integrating with every part of our product, designing APIs
  for AI agents, and building infrastructure that can handle
  the unique demands of generative AI workloads.
  
  This role demands someone who can work at the intersection
  of backend engineering and AI systems. You'll design data
  pipelines, build integration layers, optimize for AI
  inference patterns, and solve novel infrastructure
  challenges. You need to be comfortable with exploration and
  experimentation while shipping production systems that
  customers rely on.
  
  The best candidates are senior backend engineers with strong
  system design skills who are excited about generative AI and
  want to build the technical foundation for AI-powered
  products. Experience with AI/ML systems is a plus, but
  curiosity and technical depth matter more.
  
  Let's talk about what you'll do:
  
  - Design, plan and implement key features as part of a highly
    effective agile team
  - Rapidly deliver value for our customers by pushing features
    to our AWS-hosted SaaS environment daily, with automated
    CI/CD pipelines
  - Provide technical and product expertise within your team and
    across the organization
  - Communicate effectively about project status and technical
    issues
  - Participate in your team’s agile process and work to
    continually improve your team’s capabilities
  - Provide support for production operations of the Jellyfish
    product
  - Actively participate in a culture supportive of growth and
    inclusion on your team
  
  Let's talk about what you need to excel:
  
  - 10+ years of experience building SaaS products with a focus
    on Back End development
  - Strong skills in Python, and passion for building production
    software systems using Django
  - Experience working with Large Language Models and an
    understanding of how to manage context.
  - Experience working with non-traditional data platforms such
    as column stores.
  - Experience designing APIs for consumption by LLMs.
  - Fluency with tools such as Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code,
    Kiro and a track record of using them to build and ship
    fast.
  - Have worked in or interested in a growth-stage startup
  - Curiosity - great at asking questions, figuring out what
    needs to be done, building consensus, and executing
  - Love learning new things and teaching others what you know
  - Strong communication skills, and enjoy collaborative work
  
  A list of job experiences and qualification requirements is
  great, but humility, a performance-driven attitude, and a
  team-player approach are most important to us. We love to
  have fun and win in the process. We only hire people who
  have a passion for building great companies in an
  environment where a sense of humor is a must.
  
  Occasional travel may be required.
  
  Applicants must be authorized to work for any employer in
  the US. We are unable to sponsor or take over sponsorship of
  an employment visa at this time.
  
  Let’s talk about us! This is all about you, but you want to
  know a little about us. Jellyfish enables leaders to
  effectively build AI-integrated engineering teams, align
  engineering decisions with business initiatives and deliver
  the right software efficiently and on time. AI tools alone
  won’t transform your org—Jellyfish shows you what’s working,
  what’s not, and how to build high-performing teams that know
  how to use AI the right way.
