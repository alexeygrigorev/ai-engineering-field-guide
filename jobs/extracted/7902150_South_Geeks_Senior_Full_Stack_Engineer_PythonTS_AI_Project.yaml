  Hi there :)
  
  Thanks for checking in to find out about our open position.
  We´ll provide as much information as possible, but please
  feel free to reach us if you have further questions. We´ll
  be happy to see your application, even if there are skills
  you don't quite master!
  
  About Us
  
  At South Geeks, we connect top LATAM engineers with global
  teams that value autonomy, technical excellence, and long-
  term collaboration. We focus on building strong
  relationships with our partners and providing meaningful,
  challenging work for our talent.
  
  About the Client
  
  Our client is a commercial real estate technology company
  building a modern platform for brokers. Their product
  automates complex document workflows and integrates advanced
  AI-driven analysis. They prioritize engineering rigor,
  thoughtful architecture, and strong communication across
  their team.
  
  About the Role
  
  We’re seeking a highly independent Senior Full Stack
  Engineer to design and deliver core functionality for a
  large-scale web application built with React/TypeScript,
  Python/FastAPI, and PostgreSQL. This role is ideal for
  someone who excels at architectural planning, anticipates
  downstream impact, and thrives in an environment where
  alignment and communication are essential.
  
  You’ll join two other senior engineers, each owning
  substantial parallel features, and contribute to a fast-
  moving team with high expectations for clarity, initiative,
  and iterative delivery.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Lead architectural planning, create technical proposals, and
    secure alignment with other senior engineers before
    implementation.
  - Architect, design, and implement full-stack features across
    React/TypeScript, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL.
  - Develop and maintain complex UI components, including
    CKEditor integrations and DocX formatting workflows.
  - Build and optimize a multi-LLM orchestration layer that
    triggers hundreds of model calls per operation. Work with
    a sophisticated AI layer using multiple LLM
    orchestrations, not just single-call ChatGPT wrappers.
  - Break down work into GitHub issues, maintain transparent
    progress, and ship verifiable features weekly.
  
  Required Skills & Experience
  
  - Advanced proficiency in React/TypeScript, Python/FastAPI,
    and PostgreSQL.
  - Proven ability to architect systems, document plans, and
    communicate technical decisions clearly.
  - Experience integrating or orchestrating LLM APIs (OpenAI,
    Anthropic, etc.).
  - Experience with CKEditor and document manipulation
    workflows.
  - Excellent communication, planning, and independent execution
    skills.
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Experience with data-heavy or document-heavy platforms.
  - Background with AI workflow automation beyond basic chat
    interfaces.
  
  Our Team
  
  We strive to create an inspiring and growth-oriented
  environment where everyone feels valued, heard, and
  empowered. We promote both personal and professional
  development, with individualized support for your needs and
  goals. We aim to build a space where everyone can thrive.
