description: |
  At August, we’re building AI designed for one thing: helping
  law firms practice better. Unlike tools built for the AmLaw
  100, our focus is on midsized firms — where efficiency,
  client service, and competitive advantage matter most.
  
  Our platform helps lawyers draft, review, and analyze
  documents at scale, turning what used to take hours into
  minutes. We’re trusted by forward-thinking firms across the
  U.S., Australia, and Asia, and backed by leading investors
  (NEA, Pear VC, Stanford Law) to grow globally.
  
  We move quickly, learn directly from clients, and believe
  that AI is transforming the practice of law.
  
  The Opportunity
  
  August is building AGI for law. Our agents mimic a lawyers’
  reasoning, research, and drafting, and our workflows already
  outperform lawyers in third-party evaluations. We’re
  targeting mid-market law firms, automating their legal work
  and allowing them to provide our tools directly to their
  clients. Join August at an early stage as we scale our
  agents to process thousands of documents simultaneously and
  create outputs exceeding human-level accuracy.
  
  As a Founding AI Engineer at August, you will design and
  scale production-grade agents that perform legal tasks with
  expert-level reasoning. You’ll work closely with the
  founders, legal experts, and product team to deploy AI
  systems in high-stakes workflows used by real lawyers across
  the globe.
  
  What You'll Do
  
  - Build and deploy agentic systems using Python to automate,
    evaluate, and scale end-to-end legal workflows
  - Zero-to-one product development: rapidly prototype,
    evaluate, integrate, and test new product features in
    close partnership with our customers and legal team.
  - Develop new AI native workflows: implement streaming, long-
    running tasks, procedural UX, etc. for new AI tasks,
    finding the balance between state-of-the-art and
    pragmatism.
  
  About You
  
  - 3+ years of experience building products on top of LLMs,
    either in grad school or in production environments;
    strong Python skills
  - Demonstrated ability to ship quickly especially in early-
    stage environments while building scalable enterprise
    software
  - Grit - experience working at early-stage startups is a plus.
  - Ideally candidates would have experience and deep
    understanding of how infrastructure-layer (Kubernetes,
    Database, OS, Cloud Storage etc) software systems work.
