  Let’s face it: if you’re going to build the future of human
  transformation, you deserve more than a paycheck.
  
  You deserve a personal BetterUp Coach, the most curious
  teammates on the planet, and a mission that pulls you out of
  bed every morning. At BetterUp, we pair world-class coaching
  with Generative AI to help millions live with clarity and
  purpose. Ready to engineer the models that make that magic
  feel personal?
  
  What you’ll do
  
  - Prototype, fine-tune, and evaluate LLM-powered features—from
    conversational insights to practice-moment nudges—using
    Python and Jupyter notebooks.
  - Own the production lifecycle: data prep, experiment design,
    offline/online evaluation, and weekly pushes to prod
    alongside a tight squad of ML/Backend/Full Stack
    Engineers.
  - Collaborate daily with Product, Coaching Science, and
    Learning Design to turn behavior-change research into
    delightful user moments.
  - Contribute to technical design by shaping model
    architectures, retrieval strategies, and safety
    guards—while staying hands-on in code.
  - Measure what matters: define success metrics, implement A/B
    tests, and iterate quickly on real coach feedback.
  - Ship end-to-end improvements to products like FocusFrame,
    our AI copilot that helps coaches deliver higher-impact
    sessions in real time.
  
  We are a hybrid company with a focus on in-person
  collaboration when necessary. Employees are expected to be
  available to work from one of our office hubs at least two
  days per week, or eight days per month. Our US hub locations
  include: Austin, TX; New York City, NY; San Francisco, CA;
  and the Arlington, VA metro area. Please ensure you can
  realistically commit to this structure before applying.
  
  What You’ll Bring
  
  Core
  
  - 4+ years building and shipping ML systems in production,
    with at least 6–12 months hands-on with LLM fine-tuning,
    prompt engineering, or RAG pipelines.
  - Fluency in Python for AI development and comfort working in
    Jupyter/IPython.
  - Solid understanding of modern ML tooling (e.g., PyTorch,
    TensorFlow, or JAX) and containerized/cloud deployment
    basics.
  - Clear, approachable communication with both technical peers
    and non-technical partners.
  - Bias toward action, curiosity, and comfort navigating
    ambiguity in a fast-moving startup environment.
  
  Bonus (nice-to-have, not required)
  
  - Prior experience in coaching, learning-science, ed-tech, or
    behavior-change domains.
  - Exposure to RLHF, preference tuning, or multimodal models.
  
  Not sure you hit every bullet? We value growth
  mindsets—please apply anyway.
