  ## **About the job**
  
  **Join a Billion-Dollar Mission in the Making**
  
  Subject is reimagining education from the ground up. We’re backed by Kleiner Perkins, SoftBank Opportunity Fund, Owl Ventures, and founders of category-defining companies. Now we’re building the most ambitious engineering team in edtech — and we’re looking for mission-focused superstars to join our team.
  
  We’re building generative AI solutions that support grading, teacher insights, data analysis, student engagement, and personalized learning at unprecedented scale and speed. If you’re a full-stack senior engineer with experience in AI/LLM development and agent orchestration, this is your moment.
  
  **What You’ll Own**
  
  You’ll be driving core agentic AI systems and continue their evolution into best-in-class products for student and teacher support, performance analytics, real-time grading, and the personalization of education for every student. This is not just maintenance — it’s rethinking what’s possible.
  
  **Responsibilities**
  
  AI Product Ownership: Drive our agentic AI infrastructure for grading, data synthesis, student feedback, and more. Evolve prototype systems into high-scale, production-ready solutions.
  
  LLM and Agent Orchestration: Implement, extend, and optimize AI agents using tools like LangChain, semantic search, vector databases, and OpenAI APIs. Design orchestrators that drive multi-step, human-in-the-loop workflows.
  
  Hands-On Engineering: Write production-level code across front-end (Next.js, TypeScript) and back-end (Node.js, Postgres). Deploy through Docker, Vercel, and cloud services (GCP/AWS).
  
  System Thinking: Architect scalable APIs, pipelines, and infrastructure for LLM interaction, data ingestion, grading workflows, and analytics dashboards.
  
  Collaboration & Velocity: Partner with product, data, and content teams in rapid sprints. You’ll work face-to-face with senior leaders daily. Think fast. Move faster.
  
  Quality & Leadership: Champion engineering standards while balancing technical debt and speed. Mentor mid-level engineers and help build a high-trust engineering culture.
  
  **You Bring**
  
  4+ years experience in full-stack engineering, with real-world ownership of production systems.
  
  Deep understanding of prompt engineering, LLM APIs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini), vector stores (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate), and agentic frameworks (LangChain, AutoGPT, or similar).
  
  Experience with orchestration of multiple AI agents and human-in-the-loop decision-making flows.
  
  Frontend fluency in Next.js, React, TypeScript; backend confidence in Node.js, Postgres.
  
  DevOps skills in Docker, CI/CD, and cloud (AWS or GCP).
  
  Startup hunger: You’ve shipped with incomplete specs, found creative solutions, and worn many hats.
  
  Speed and grit: You operate at championship pace, make decisions quickly, and iterate faster than anyone you know.
  
  **Cultural Fit**
  
  We are a championship team — not a family. We care, but we perform. We win together.
  
  You thrive in intensity. 60+ hour weeks? In-office every day? That’s your edge.
  
  You believe impact beats pedigree. Your resume is just the starting point — your results will speak loudest.
  
  **Mission-Driven Tech That Changes Lives**
  
  At Subject, we’re building tools that directly help students graduate high school, improve outcomes, and unlock opportunities. Every line of code has impact. Every model deployed touches real learners.
  We’re not in this to participate. We’re here to change the future — and if you are too, we want to talk.
