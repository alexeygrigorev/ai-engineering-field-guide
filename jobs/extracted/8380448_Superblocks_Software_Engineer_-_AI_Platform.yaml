description: |
  **Superblocks** is building the frontier platform that enables a billion non engineers to create software with AI. We are reinventing how enterprises build internal systems and redefining the future of SaaS.
  
  **
  
  Our platform is powered by **Clark**, an AI agent backed by organizational memory that can explore company data and generate enterprise software within strict security, compliance, and execution boundaries. Clark executes untrusted code in secure sandboxes and runs applications globally with low latency. You’ll design the systems that make Clark accurate, safe, and production-ready at scale.
  
  **What you will work on**
  
  - An AI memory system with short-term memory, persistent memory, and organizational knowledge graphs, plus data exploration for humans and agents.
  
  - AI agents that generate, execute, debug, and test code, handling failures and feedback so non-engineers can ship production applications.
  
  - A centralized governance layer where IT admins can see and control apps, workflows, users, agents, secrets, and policies.
  
  **What we look for**
  
  - Strong background in backend systems, platforms and database design.
  
  - Experience building agentic systems, LLM applications, or orchestration frameworks
  
  - Experience with security, sandboxing, or isolation in distributed systems
  
  - Deep intuition for model behavior, evaluation, and performance tradeoffs
  
  - Ability to design simple abstractions over complex AI and systems problems
  
  **Why this role matters**
  
  - You will define how AI agents run safely in production at global scale
  
  - You will solve problems at the boundary of agentic AI, security, and distributed systems
  
  - You will help build the platform that turns AI into dependable software infrastructure
  
  Compensation**
  
  The base pay range for this role is $175,000 – $275,000 per year.
