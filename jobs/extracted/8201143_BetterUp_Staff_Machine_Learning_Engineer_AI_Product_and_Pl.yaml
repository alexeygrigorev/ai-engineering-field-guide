  **Let’s face it, a company whose mission is human transformation better have some fresh thinking about the employer/employee relationship.**
  
  We do. We can’t cram it all in here, but you’ll start noticing it from the first interview.
  
  Even our candidate experience is different. And when you get an offer from us (and accept it), you get way more than a paycheck. You get a personal BetterUp Coach, a development plan, a trained and coached manager, the most amazing team you’ve ever met (yes, each with their own personal BetterUp Coach), and most importantly, work that matters.
  
  This makes for a remarkably focused and fulfilling work experience. Frankly, it’s not for everyone. But for people with fire in their belly, it’s a game-changing, career-defining, soul-lifting move.
  
  **Join us and we promise you the most intense and fulfilling years of your career, doing life-changing work in a fun, inventive, soulful culture.**
  
  If that sounds exciting—and the job description below feels like a fit—we really should start talking.
  
  AI is transforming the future of coaching—and BetterUp is at the forefront of that transformation. We’re seeking a creative, product-minded machine learning engineer who’s eager to roll up their sleeves and help shape what comes next alongside our world-class team.
  
  The ideal candidate is motivated by impact, thrives in fast-paced and ambiguous environments, and brings clarity where there’s complexity. You’re someone who values empowering your teammates as much as your own growth, and who stays focused on what matters most: delivering meaningful, human-centered value to our members and customers.
  
  At BetterUp, we support and challenge one another to grow, always with empathy and excellence. We’re looking for someone who shares our commitment to continuous learning, who takes pride in craftspersonship, and who believes deeply in the power of technology to drive positive change in the world. And because we know peak performance comes from balance, we foster a culture that supports you in bringing your full self to our mission.
  
  **We are a hybrid company with a focus on in-person collaboration when necessary. Employees are expected to be available to work from one of our office hubs at least two days per week, or eight days per month. Our US hub locations include: Austin, TX; New York City, NY; San Francisco, CA; and the Arlington, VA metro area. Please ensure you can realistically commit to this structure before applying.**
