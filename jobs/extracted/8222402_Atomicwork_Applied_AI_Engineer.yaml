  We’re looking for an Applied AI Engineer to join our
  Engineering team to design, build, evaluate, and deploy
  intelligent AI systems that power enterprise workflows,
  autonomous assistants, and machine-assisted task automation.
  This role is based out of our US office and comes with
  competitive pay and practical benefits for you and your
  family.
  
  We’re looking for strong problem solvers who’ve shipped
  impactful AI-driven functionality before and can scale our
  platform intelligence with quality and ownership.  What
  you'll do — responsibilities
  
  - Design, build, and fine-tune transformer-based and
    retrieval-augmented models for natural language
    understanding, intent classification, summarization, and
    context-aware reasoning.
  - Develop AI components that power automated knowledge search,
    semantic retrieval, agentic task orchestration, and
    conversational assistants.
  - Integrate AI systems with production data pipelines in a
    scalable and secure way.
  - Build evaluation pipelines, define metrics, and establish
    performance and reliability benchmarks for AI features.
  - Collaborate with engineering, data, and product teams to
    productize models with observability, monitoring, and
    continuous improvement.
  - Participate in code reviews, architecture discussions, and
    cross-team problem solving.
  - Take end-to-end ownership of features — from problem
    definition to deployment and performance monitoring. What
    we’re looking for (qualifications)
  - Strong programming experience in Python and familiarity with
    ML/AI frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
  - Hands-on experience with transformer-based models (LLMs),
    embeddings, vector search, and retrieval augmentation.
  - Experience building or integrating semantic search, RAG, or
    multi-agent workflows.
  - Demonstrated ability to build reliable ML/AI systems in
    production environments.
  - Understanding of scalable backend systems, cloud
    infrastructure, and model serving techniques.
  - Good software engineering practices: clean code, testing,
    version control (Git), and collaboration.
  - Curious mindset, product empathy, and willingness to learn
    new technologies quickly.
  - We don’t require specific degrees — practical skills,
    curiosity, and ownership matter most.
  
  Why we are different (culture)  As part of Atomicwork, you
  can shape our company and business from idea to production.
  Our cultural values set the bar high and help us create a
  better workplace for everyone.
  
  
  Agency: Be self-directed and take initiative.
  
  Taste: Hold a high bar — sweat the details and build with
  care.
  
  Ownership: Take full responsibility for wins and setbacks.
  
  Mastery: Commit to continuous learning and improvement.
  
  Impatience: Move with urgency towards outcomes.
  
  Customer Obsession: Put customer value at the heart of every
  decision.
