  Position Overview We are looking for a highly skilled Senior
  AI Software Engineer to design and build smart, user-facing
  AI features that make complex business workflows simple,
  intuitive, and insightful. In this hands-on role, you’ll
  work across the full AI/ML stack to bring intelligent
  experiences—such as context-aware chatbots, AI-driven data
  explanations, automated task guidance, and interactive
  forecasting dashboards—to life. This is a unique opportunity
  to shape how users interact with data, make decisions, and
  complete critical tasks across payroll, compliance, and
  labor management systems—using cutting-edge AI tools like
  LLMs, embeddings, and Model Context Protocol (MCP).
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  AI-Powered Feature Development
  
  - Design and develop context-aware AI assistants and chatbots
    that help users navigate complex workflows and answer
    domain-specific questions.
  - Build AI-guided task assistants that proactively surface
    recommendations, fill in missing data, or automate next
    steps in real-time.
  - Implement explainable AI (XAI) features that help users
    understand insights, predictions, or system decisions
    transparently.
  
  Interactive Analytics, Forecasting & Dashboards
  
  - Develop AI-driven dashboards and prediction engines that
    provide instant insights into user actions, financial
    trends, labor forecasts, and potential compliance risks.
  - Build self-service AI tools that allow users to ask natural
    language questions of their data and receive visual,
    interpretable responses.
  - Collaborate with UX and product teams to embed these
    insights directly into the application experience.
  
  Architecture & Integration
  
  - Build scalable backend services in Python, TypeScript, and
    Node.js, integrating with LLMs, vector stores, and
    analytics engines.
  - Use Model Context Protocol (MCP) to manage and preserve
    context across chat, prediction, and recommendation
    workflows.
  - Leverage cloud-native tools (AWS Lambda, SageMaker, Bedrock,
    DynamoDB) to deploy and scale AI features.
  
  Engineering & Collaboration
  
  - Write clean, production-quality code and participate in
    architectural reviews, technical design, and agile
    ceremonies.
  - Work closely with data scientists, designers, and other
    engineers to prototype and ship AI-powered product
    experiences.
  - Continuously evaluate emerging AI tools, LLM frameworks, and
    APIs to push the product’s intelligence capabilities
    forward.
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  - 5–8 years of professional software engineering experience,
    with significant hands-on AI/ML application development.
  - Strong programming skills in Python, TypeScript, and
    Node.js, including experience building and integrating
    backend APIs.
  - Experience building with LLMs, embeddings, and prompt
    engineering, especially for chat, recommendations, or
    summarization tasks.
  - Familiarity with Model Context Protocol (MCP) or similar
    frameworks for managing long-lived AI context.
  - Proficiency in cloud platforms (preferably AWS) and data
    technologies (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis, DynamoDB).
  - Passion for delivering intuitive, AI-enhanced user
    experiences through strong cross-functional collaboration.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Experience building AI features in productized
    environments—such as guided workflows, task automation, or
    user-facing insights.
  - Familiarity with LangChain, Semantic Kernel, or similar
    orchestration frameworks.
  - Knowledge of forecasting models, causal inference, or time-
    series prediction in business/product contexts.
  - Experience building natural language interfaces over
    structured business data.
  - Background in payroll, HR tech, fintech, or operational
    compliance is a plus.

    involve walking or standing for brief periods of time.
    Some positions may entail exerting up to 15 lbs. of force
