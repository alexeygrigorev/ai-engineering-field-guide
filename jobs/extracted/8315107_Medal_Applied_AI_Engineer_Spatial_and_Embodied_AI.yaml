  The Company: General Intuition
  
  Today’s most powerful foundation models are trained on
  written words. But human intelligence extends far beyond
  language. Truly intelligent machines must move from words to
  worlds, developing the ability to perceive, anticipate, and
  act within complex environments.
  
  We believe games represent the highest density expression of
  ingenuity and problem-solving. General Intuition builds on
  Medal, the world’s largest and fastest-growing platform for
  gaming moments. Each year, players capture billions of
  gameplay clips across countless environments, producing
  uniquely rich data for learning systems.
  
  Over the past year, we’ve been advancing the frontier
  across:
  
  - agents capable of deep spatial and temporal reasoning,
  - world models and simulation environments for training and
    evaluation, and
  - video understanding with an emphasis on generalization
    beyond games.
  
  The Role
  
  We are looking for an Applied AI Engineer to connect our
  research with the reality of our partners’ environments that
  are constrained by hardware, power, and real world
  interference.
  
  We work with customers operating in complex areas across
  robotics, simulation, aerospace and defense, manufacturing,
  logistics, industrial automation, and more. You will be
  responsible for taking our model, focusing on post-training,
  evaluation data, and integrations to ensure our customer's
  platforms work regardless of a messy, constrained tech stack
  and hardware.
  
  You will embed with our partners to understand their actual
  problems, not just what they put in an RFP. You’ll look at
  their legacy control systems, latency challenges, and power
  needs and figure out how our AI helps them achieve something
  that was never possible before.
  
  You'll be a key part of the feedback loop. When a model
  fails because of sensor noise or unexpected physics, you
  don't just log a bug. You figure out why, and you work
  across our team to fix the underlying architecture. You
  ensure we are building technology that survives contact with
  the real world, for years to come.
  
  We're looking for a technical polyglot. You might have
  started in systems engineering, physics, or neuroscience and
  moved to ML, or the other way around. You know Python and
  PyTorch, but you aren't afraid of C++ or low-level hardware
  constraints.
  
  Most importantly, you have high agency and want to be a part
  of an amazing team.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  Applied AI/ML Engineering & Mission Ownership
  
  - Embed with partners to solve the problems with our frontier
    AI/ML tools, informing our research and product
    development plan along the way…not just deploy software.
  - Be the primary filter between the messy reality of the
    physical world and our research and technical staff,
    surfacing real commercial challenges and pain-points.
  - Build and tune models, prototype, script, and patch (often
    in the field), turning ambiguous requirements into
    executable code.
  
  Systems Integration & Edge Compute
  
  - Build the connective tissue between our AI and the
    customer's reality, and then help them rethink the art of
    the possible. This means writing high-performance code
    (C++/Go/Python) that integrates our inference engine with
    legacy sensors, RTOS, and diverse hardware peripherals.
  - Optimize complex ML models for survival in harsh computing
    environments.
  - Leverage our simulation and world-model capabilities to
    validate operational plans before they touch physical
    hardware.
  
  Technical Diplomacy
  
  - Translate the probabilistic nature of AI into the
    deterministic language of industrial control systems and
    mission operators.
  - Explain trade-offs to non-technical individuals and deep
    technical details to systems engineers, building the trust
    required to deploy autonomous systems in critical paths.
  
  Qualifications
  
  Required
  
  - 5+ years experience taking complex systems from prototype to
    production, within software engineering or applied AI/ML
  - Strong experience in the ML stack (Python, Docker,
    Kubernetes, infrastructure-as-code, and CI/CD for ML
    pipelines) with competent systems programming skills (C++,
    Go, Rust, or Java), and ability to use modern AI coding
    tools
  - Strong applied machine learning experience, specifically in
    the lifecycle of deploying, evaluating, and debugging
    models
  - Experience in at least one of the following, with working
    knowledge of the others:
    - Agents or policy learning (e.g., RL, planning, control
      theory, spatial reasoning)
    - World models, simulation environments (Unity/Unreal,
      Omniverse, Isaac Sim), or model-based learning
    - Perception, sensor fusion, or inverse dynamics models (IDMs)
  - Exposure to bridging the "hardware-software" gap:
    integrating AI inference with sensors, edge devices, RTOS,
    or legacy industrial networks
  - Full-stack systems mindset: understanding of memory
    management, concurrency, networking, and APIs
  - U.S. citizenship and ability to obtain and maintain a
    national security clearance (TS/SCI preferred)
  - Ability to comply with export control requirements
    (ITAR/EAR)
  
  Preferred
  
  - Experience, and comfort in, forward-type environments often
    found with partners across the industrial base, defense,
    intelligence, aerospace, and robotics environments at the
    edge
  - Edge AI, inference optimization, or deployment in
    constrained settings (TensorRT, ONNX, or mobile inference
    as examples)
  - Background in autonomous systems, control, or real-time
    systemsStartup or early-stage engineering experience
  - Understanding of secure systems engineering or DevSecOps
    experience in regulated industries, including degraded,
    intermittent, limited) networking constraints
  - Open-source contributions or demonstrable applied systems
    work, or a portfolio of "side projects" that demonstrate
    AI/ML, and engineering curiosity
  
  The Stack
  
  - ML & Research: Python, PyTorch, NumPy, OpenCV, Triton, CUDA
    for large-scale training, real-time inference, and applied
    CV/ML

    with continuous evaluation, A/B testing, and performance
    monitoring across training and production

    plus performance-critical C++ components; containerized
    with Docker and Kubernetes on GCP or on-prem
  - Clients & Edge Software: Electron/React desktop apps, C# and
