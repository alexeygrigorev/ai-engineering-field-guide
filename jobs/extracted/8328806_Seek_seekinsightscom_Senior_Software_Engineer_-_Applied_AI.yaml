  About the Role At Seek, we’re building the first-ever
  marketplace for data apps—where providers and consumers
  connect to drive real business impact fast. Insight Cloud
  isn’t just another BI tool; it’s a platform built from the
  ground up for the secure exchange of complete, production-
  ready data applications.
  
  We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer, AI Integration
  who’s passionate about building polished, scalable
  applications and excited to bring emerging AI capabilities
  into real-world products. You’ll work across the stack—front
  end, back end, and cloud infrastructure—while helping define
  how AI features like natural language search, guided
  workflows, and intelligent recommendations shape the future
  of Insight Cloud.
  
  
  In this role, you’ll get to:
  
  - Build full stack features with React, Python, and modern
    APIs that deliver high-quality user experiences.
  - Design backend services & APIs that integrate AI models and
    external AI services into the platform.
  - Create intuitive workflows powered by AI—conversational
    querying, assisted discovery, guided analytics.
  - Connect AI-driven features to Snowflake and our semantic
    modeling layer for seamless data-driven apps.
  - Contribute to app store experiences with AI-powered
    recommendations and publishing flows.
  - Ensure reliability at scale with strong testing, CI/CD
    pipelines, and observability.
  - Collaborate with product, design, and engineering peers to
    turn AI opportunities into customer-ready features.
  
  We’re excited about you because you have:
  
  - 6+ years of full stack development experience, with strong
    skills in React and Python.
  - A track record of shipping production-grade web applications
    (SaaS or data platforms a plus).
  - Solid understanding of system architecture, API design, and
    distributed systems.
  - Hands-on experience integrating AI/ML into software (APIs,
    SDKs, or model endpoints).
  - Strong debugging/problem-solving skills across frontend and
    backend.
  - Excellent communication and collaboration in agile, cross-
    functional teams.
  
  Bonus points if you have:
  
  - Experience integrating LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) or RAG
    pipelines into apps.
  - Familiarity with agent frameworks or intelligent assistants.
  - Experience with Snowflake or other cloud data warehouses.
  - Startup experience and comfort working in a fast-paced
    environment.
  
  Salary:
  
  - The annual salary range for this position is between
    $150,000 - $175,000, depending on experience and
    qualifications.
  
  Benefits:

    holidays, 401K, Vision Insurance
