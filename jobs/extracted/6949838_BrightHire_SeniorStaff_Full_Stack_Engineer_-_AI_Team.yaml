  **About the Role**
  
  You will own the end-to-end delivery of many of our biggest AI features. Working in lockstep with Product and Design, you’ll move quickly to design, build, and refine features throughout the entire stack from prompt engineering and evals through the backend, all the way to frontend interactions. You’ll focus on the output quality of your AI features and make sure users get accurate, on-brand AI outputs fast. You’ll work on real features people use every day—things like:
  
  - Automatic interview coaching that provides tailored feedback and guidance based on an interviewer's recent interviews, with customizable content.
  
  - An AI Candidate skills matrix that displays structured summaries mapped to key skills aligned with the job description.
  
  - An AI assistant that allows users to instantly query any detail about a candidate or interview using natural language.
  
  - Customizable interview summaries that enable customers to create fully personalized AI-generated summaries using their own structure and criteria.
  
  - …and more
  **What You’ll Bring**
  - You have real world experience building generative AI applications end to end, building prompt chains, eval harnesses, vector search, and more.
  
  - You know how to make LLMs useful in a product. You understand what they are good at and bad at, and you are able to harness their strengths.
  
  - You have plenty of experience building across the stack in Python and Javascript/Typescript, especially building out the backend logic, data models, and architecture.
  
  - You think deeply about how AI features work for end users and can make decisions with user empathy.
  
  - You’ve worked with both structured (SQL) and unstructured data (raw text) and know how to transform them and utilize them together.
  
  - You care about personality, tone, accuracy, safety, and speed as integral to the AI features you build.
  
  - You have product instincts and work well with design.
  
  - You move fast and independently, but you know when to pair and when to pull others in.
  **About our team**
  - You’ll have the opportunity to work on high-impact projects in small, autonomous squads, with the flexibility to lead initiatives or focus as an individual contributor depending on your goals and interests.
  
  - Our developer experience is thoughtfully designed, with fast CI (*Note to Recruiters and Placement Agencies: We do not accept unsolicited agency resumes. Please do not forward unsolicited agency resumes to our website.
