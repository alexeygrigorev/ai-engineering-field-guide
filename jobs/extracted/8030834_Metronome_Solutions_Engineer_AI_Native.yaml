  About Us
  
  Metronome is the leading usage-based billing platform built
  for modern software companies. With Metronome, companies can
  launch products faster, offer any pricing model, and
  streamline finance workflows without writing code.
  
  Our platform computes millions of invoices per billing
  period and is scaling rapidly to accommodate new customers,
  saving them hours of development time and manual invoicing
  and enabling them to use consumption data to better serve
  their customers. Our customers love our product and
  approach, and we’re humbled to work with amazing companies
  like OpenAI, NVIDIA, Confluent, and Anthropic.
  
  You'll be joining an experienced team that includes founders
  who have successfully built and sold startups before. Our
  founders and employees also have direct experience building
  and scaling teams through massive growth at companies like
  Dropbox, Clever, and New Relic. On the back of this
  experience and our success-to-date, we’ve raised over $128M
  from leading investors including NEA, Andreessen Horowitz,
  General Catalyst, Elad Gil, and Workday Ventures. We’re also
  proud to have founders and executives of companies like
  Segment, Plaid, Looker, Gitlab, Confluent, HashiCorp, and
  Snowflake, as investors who have experienced the pain we're
  solving firsthand.
  
  About the Role
  
  The AI Native Solutions team at Metronome operates at the
  intersection of technical sales, implementation, and
  customer success, purpose-built for the velocity and unique
  needs of AI-first companies. Unlike traditional sales
  engineering roles, this position owns the large parts of if
  not all of the deal cycle - from first call through
  technical win - and gets hands-on with implementation to
  ensure customers go live quickly.
  
  As an AI Native Solutions Engineer, you'll be the primary
  technical owner for fast-moving AI companies that may need
  to launch usage-based billing on tight timelines.
  
  Note that this role requires you to be in San Francisco, New
  York City, or Chicago.
  
  What You'll Do
  
  Owning the technical win:
  
  - Taking qualified inbound leads and driving them through
    discovery, demo, POC, and technical win
  - Using efficient discovery to quickly understand billing
    challenges, product launch timelines, and technical
    requirements
  - Bringing energy and urgency to every engagement—proactively
    driving deals forward, identifying blockers early, and
    building relationships across the customer organization
    (engineering, finance, product) to create champions
  - Running streamlined demos tailored to technical founders and
    product/engineering teams
  
  Driving hands-on implementation:
  
  - Providing customers with clear, actionable implementation
    plans to implement their usage-based billing launches
  - Writing code snippets, configuration examples, and
    integration guides to accelerate customer time-to-value
  - Pair programming or working alongside customer teams during
    POCs and initial setup
  - Designing up/downstream integrations into prospect systems
    with a bias toward pragmatic solutions that get them live
    quickly
  
  Building deep AI market expertise:
  
  - Building relationships with technical founders, engineering
    leaders, product, and finance teams at AI companies
  - Understanding the unique monetization challenges facing LLM
    providers, generative AI companies (image, video, audio),
    and AI tooling/wrapper companies and providing
    consultative guidance when prospects need direction on
    pricing and packaging strategy and implementation
  - Staying current on AI industry trends, pricing models, and
    competitive dynamics
  
  This role is perfect for someone who thrives in high-
  velocity environments, loves solving technical problems in
  real-time, and wants to be on the front lines of how AI
  companies monetize their products. Metronome directly
  influences how the next generation of AI infrastructure gets
  built—and our AI Native Solutions team drives this influence
  with our fastest-growing customer segment.
  
  Metronome is a startup. As such, there's a lot still to
  figure out and tremendous room for high-agency, curious
  individuals to impact our direction and strategy, build
  processes from zero to one, and generally make a difference.
  If this excites you as much as it excites us, let's talk.
  
  Qualifications
  
  This is roughly the set of things we’re looking for - if
  you’re interested in this role and don’t meet some of these
  on paper, err on the side of applying!
  
  - 3+ years of experience in technical, customer-facing roles
    involving SaaS products (for example, sales engineering,
    solutions architecture, technical account management,
    implementation consulting)
  - 1+ years of experience working with, at, or selling to AI
    companies - you understand how AI-first companies operate,
    their unique challenges, and the market landscape
  - Proven ability to own and drive customer-facing engagements
    and relationships independently
  - Strong technical aptitude with the ability to quickly learn
    new systems, write code snippets, and guide technical
    implementations
  - Experience working in high-velocity environments where
    speed-to-value matters and customers need to launch
    quickly
  - Excellent communication skills with technical buyers
    (engineers, product managers, technical founders)
  
  Bonus Points
  
  - Deep knowledge of the quote-to-cash space, including
    integrating with or otherwise interacting with tools like
    Salesforce, NetSuite, CPQs, etc.
  - Experience as a software engineer, product manager, or in
    other technical roles.
  - Experience in a pure sales role, particularly selling to
    technical buyers in engineering and product organizations
    or selling as a founding or early salesperson at a
    startup.
  - Familiarity and enthusiasm for AI developer tooling (Cursor,
    Lovable, Vercel, LangChain, etc.) and the broader AI
    infrastructure ecosystem
  
  Compensation
  
  The estimated salary range for this role is $149,600 -
  $210,000 OTE. In addition to your salary, Metronome offers a
  competitive total rewards package, including but not limited

  health benefits, and other benefits listed below.
  
  The actual base salary will vary based on factors including
  market value, individual qualifications objectively assessed
  during the interview process, and previous experience. The
  listed range above should serve as a guideline and may be
  modified at any time.
  
  We believe that compensation reflects the expected impact
  you will have at the company, relative to the market value
  of your role. We also conduct an annual pay audit to ensure
  pay is fair, indexed to market value, and that pay takes
  into account continued performance at Metronome. If you
  would like to learn more about our philosophy or about why
  we are all billing nerds, send us a message. We’d love to
  talk!

  for Full-time employees:
  
  - Excellent medical, dental, vision, and life insurance
    coverage, including a One Medical membership
