  About HouseAccount
  
  At HouseAccount, we’re building the modern home services
  platform, starting with the handyman. We connect homeowners
  to trusted local providers and make it simple to book,
  manage, and pay for everything their home needs in one
  place. By combining vetted pros, transparent pricing, and
  AI-powered automation, we’re turning home maintenance into
  something homeowners don’t have to think about.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  You’ll lead the effort to make HouseAccount truly AI-first,
  designing, prototyping, and deploying intelligent systems
  that power how we match, message, and manage home services.
  You’ll work closely with our product and growth teams to
  identify repetitive workflows and convert them into smart,
  automated agents that scale what we do every day.
  
  A typical day might include:
  
  - Building and fine-tuning workflows with OpenAI APIs,
    Anthropic Claude, or Mistral models
  - Using frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, or Vercel AI
    SDK to connect multiple models and data sources
  - Designing retrieval and memory systems that help agents
    reason across internal data (CRM, outreach logs, provider
    data)
  - Prototyping automations using Zapier, n8n, or custom
    Python/Ruby scripts before productizing them
  - Collaborating with engineering to connect model outputs back
    to our Rails app via clean APIs
  - Experimenting with prompt architectures, tool use, and
    context management to improve performance and accuracy
  
  You’ll work across the stack, but your focus will be
  building and scaling agentic systems that make our
  operations and product smarter.
  
  What Matters to Us
  
  - You’ve built real things with OpenAI or similar APIs -
    agents, copilots, automations, or internal tools
  - You understand how to translate messy real-world processes
    into structured logic for AI systems
  - You’re comfortable working across data pipelines, APIs, and
    backend logic to get something working end-to-end
  - You thrive in fast, iterative environments and care more
    about getting something live than perfecting it in a doc
  - You’re deeply curious about how AI can simplify human work
    and scale impact
  
  Who You Are
  
  - 3 to 7 years of software or AI engineering experience,
    ideally in a startup or applied AI setting
  - Proficient in Python (FastAPI, Flask, or Django) and
    comfortable building integrations in JavaScript or
    TypeScript
  - Familiar with LangChain, LlamaIndex, or similar frameworks
    for orchestration
  - Experienced with vector databases like pgvector, Pinecone,
    or Weaviate
  - Familiar with workflow automation tools such as Zapier or
    n8n
  - Bonus: you’ve been a founding or early engineer and thrive
    in the 0 to 1 stage
  
  Why This Role Matters
  
  You’ll be one of the first engineers shaping how AI is built
  into the DNA of our product and operations. This role sits
  at the intersection of engineering, product, and applied
  research - bringing intelligent systems from idea to
  production and defining how we scale smarter.
