  - Cloud Platform Proficiency: Hands-on experience with AWS (or
    other cloud platforms), enabling scalable deployments and
    data solutions.
  - Modern DevOps: Strong understanding of Docker, CI/CD
    pipelines, and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for secure,
    reliable, and maintainable infrastructure.
  - AI & NLP Skills: Experience with AI/ML libraries or
