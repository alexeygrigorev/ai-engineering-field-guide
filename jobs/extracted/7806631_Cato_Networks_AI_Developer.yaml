  **Welcome to the future of cloud networking and security!  **
  
  Cato Networks is the first company to converge enterprise networking and security into one centralized and global service that is delivered by cloud. It is led by networking and security pioneer Shlomo Kramer (Check Point, Imperva) and early investor (Palo Alto Networks, Exabeem, Trusteer and more). Cato’s unique technology inspired a brand-new product category, later named “SASE” by Gartner and a market expected to reach $28.5 billion by 2028.
  This is your opportunity to get on the rocket ship and join a company that is building a cutting-edge enterprise network and secure cloud platform, and is on a fast track to becoming the worldwide market leader – don’t miss it!
  
  We are looking for a unique, hands-on Machine Learning / AI Developer to design and implement AI-powered solutions that improve business processes across the company. This role focuses on delivering custom-built tools and workflows that off-the-shelf products cannot provide, working closely with multiple departments such as Customer Success, Sales, HR, and more.
  
   
  
  **Responsibilities:**
  
  - Collaborate with stakeholders across global teams to identify opportunities where AI can enhance business processes.
  
  - Perform deep research and analysis on organizational data to understand its structure, quality, biases, and limitations, ensuring AI solutions meet business expectations.
  
  - Design, develop, and deploy AI-based solutions tailored to organizational needs (e.g., customer success agents, HR process automation, sales optimization).
  
  - Build workflows, agents, and ML pipelines, ensuring solutions are reliable, scalable, and production-ready.
  
  - Integrate diverse data sources and leverage multiple data types to create actionable insights.
  
  - Work closely with business units' management to address specific operational challenges.
  
  **Requirements:**
  
  - 6+ years of hands-on software development experience with a focus on AI/ML applications.
  
  - Strong proficiency in Python and experience with ML workflows and MLOps.
  
  - Familiarity with workflow orchestration tools and/or process automation tools.
  
  - Solid understanding of data integration and data-driven solution design.
  
  - Ability to work cross-functionally and interface effectively with multiple departments.
  
  - Strong initiative and problem-solving skills, with the ability to independently gather requirements and propose solutions.
  
  - Passion for AI-driven process optimization, ideally in business domains as mentioned above.
  
  - Familiarity with cloud platforms and modern AI frameworks is an advantage.
  
  - **Strong research skills focused on data analysis** — ability to investigate datasets, validate data quality, identify inconsistencies or gaps, and ensure the data foundation supports high-quality AI solutions.
