  Consumer Edge is a data innovation and AI company redefining
  how professionals understand consumer and business behavior.
  Our mission is to create the most actionable data products
  that transform how our clients make decisions. Working with
  world-class data partners, we deliver real-time,
  transaction-based intelligence enriched by deep industry
  expertise. We believe that in the right hands, data has the
  power to change the way we work.

  the heart of everything we do. We are a group of passionate
  technologists who enable the company mission to derive
  insights from a growing number of datasets, and create

  Role summary
  
  We are looking for a Senior Engineer who is motivated to
  help us create the next generation of AI Products.
  Responsibilities will include development of backend
  services, interaction with state of the art AI models, and
  data retrieval from internal and external sources. You will
  work with Product Managers, Data Scientists and other
  Engineers both in the team and in the whole technology
  organization to bridge the gap between product requirements,
  AI, and our rich data sources. You will deal with non-
  trivial and non-deterministic flows, entirely dictated by
  the user’s requests and the AI interpretation of those,
  within the guardrails we create to ensure they achieve their
  goals.
  
  About the team
  
  You’ll be joining Consumer Edge’s AI Products Team. We are a
  distributed cross-disciplinary team located across Europe
  and the US. Our mission is to build a proactive intelligence
  layer that seamlessly integrates with user workflows, acting
  as a copilot for exploration, surfacing insights, and
  suggesting next steps. This will be achieved through
  unified, embedded, and proactive intelligence. You’ll be
  joining a group of software engineers, product managers and
  data scientists and working closely with stakeholders to use
  data to answer real-world business questions. The product is
  still at an early stage with a huge roadmap ahead and a lot
  of innovation happening in the field so you’ll have the
  opportunity to influence technical design, features and
  implementation details.
  
  We believe in building a culture of collaboration, with
  everyone contributing to build something great, sharing both
  the successes and overcoming the challenges together.
  
  Your main responsibilities
  
  - Develop new user-facing features
  - Work on backend services, data pipelines, and cloud
    infrastructure
  - Keep up to date with the latest developments in AI models
    and architectures
  - Contribute to the vision and ensure the technical
    feasibility of product requirements
  - Optimize the system for accuracy, speed and user experience
  - Collaborate with other team members and stakeholders
  - Collaborate with other teams both at the input side and the
    output side of our systems
  
  What you’ll bring to the team
  
  - 10 years experience working with backend systems and cloud
    architectures
  - You are proficient in parallel and concurrent programming
  - You know how to build software in a robust and testable way
  - You know how to design APIs and interact with other teams to
    evolve them effectively
  - You are familiar with Python and SQL
  - You are great at collaborating with the team and
    communicating with stakeholders
  
  Nice to have
  
  - You have experience working with AI APIs
  - You have experience building agentic workflows
  - You have experience working with data pipelines
  
  What our stack looks like
  
  - We write our code exclusively in Python, with type checking
    and great test coverage. Our services use FastAPI and our
    pipelines use Dagster and DBT.
  - We deploy our infrastructure on Google Cloud using Terraform
  - We work with a variety of AI providers
  - We use GraphQL and REST to query our APIs, and SQL to read
    data from our tables
  
  Benefits & perks
  
  - We are a remote-first company with a distributed environment
    and flexible working arrangements. We believe that
    distributed workers should be first-class citizens. We
    also have an office in New York if offices are your thing.
