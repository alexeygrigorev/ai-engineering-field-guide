  Job Overview:
  
  We are seeking a highly skilled Individual Contributor (IC)
  to design and implement agentic AI solutions on the LPL Data
  Experience (LDX) platform. This role is ideal for a self-
  driven engineer who thrives in a fast-paced environment,
  learns quickly, and delivers innovative solutions with
  minimal guidance.
  
  You will build AI-first, agentic frameworks that automate
  data governance, exception tracking, reconciliation
  processes, and lifecycle management across multiple domains.
  These solutions will integrate seamlessly into LDX, enabling
  users to review exceptions, configure rules, and visualize
  reconciliation results through intuitive UI components.
  
  This is a hands-on development role—you will own the design,
  coding, deployment, and optimization of AI-driven workflows
  on AWS, leveraging modern orchestration frameworks, LLM-
  based intelligence, and ML engineering practices integrated
  into the SDLC.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Embed AI-first and ML engineering principles into SDLC,
    ensuring intelligent automation and predictive
    capabilities are considered from design through
    deployment.
  - Design and develop agentic AI solutions for:
    - Data governance tracking and compliance monitoring.
    - Exception detection and resolution across multiple data
      domains.
    - Reconciliation frameworks using rule-based and AI-driven
      logic.
    - Lifecycle management workflows for investor and operational
      domains.
  - Build intelligent agents that apply rules or adaptive
    intelligence to automate exception handling and
    reconciliation.
  - Develop APIs and microservices using Python (FastAPI) and
    .NET Core for agentic workflows.
  - Integrate AI workflows with LDX UI components built in
    Angular for user review and configuration.
  - Implement event-driven architectures using AWS EventBridge,
    Lambda, and Step Functions for real-time orchestration.
  - Deploy and manage LLMs (Claude, GPT, Amazon Titan) via AWS
    Bedrock and integrate RAG pipelines using LangChain or
    Haystack.
  - Build knowledge bases and embedding models for contextual
    reasoning using vector databases (Pinecone, OpenSearch).
  - Apply memory management techniques for multi-agent
    orchestration (short-term and long-term memory
    persistence).
  - Ensure observability and reliability using AWS CloudWatch,
    X-Ray, and Dynatrace.
  - Implement security best practices (IAM, KMS, encryption) and
    compliance frameworks (SOC2, GDPR).
  - Build automation frameworks using UiPath or RPA tools to
    complement AI-driven workflows.
  - Optimize for performance, scalability, and cost efficiency
    in AWS deployments.
  - Stay current with emerging AI orchestration frameworks, LLM
    technologies, and cloud-native patterns.
