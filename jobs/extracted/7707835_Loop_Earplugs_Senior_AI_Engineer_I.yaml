  We are Loop
  
  Loop Earplugs is reinventing how people experience the world
  by enabling them to live life at their own volume. 2024 was
  a pivotal year at Loop – we hit 14,000,000 earplugs sold,
  were named ‘The Best Earplugs for Concerts’ by The New York
  Times, and expanded our product offering to a complete range
  of solutions for day and night. Oh – and not to mention
  making history as the first company to win Deloitte’s Fast
  50 Belgium twice.
  
  But this is just the beginning. As we continue to develop
  disruptive products, we’re constantly on the lookout for the
  next big idea - and building a team who can make it happen.
  
  Being a Looper means making a difference. Whatever your
  role, this is your stage to make a real impact and bring
  your ideas to life. Better yet, you’ll join a fast-growing,
  global team of 250+ people who are passionate, down-to-earth
  and eager to tackle challenges together.
  
  5+ years in AI | Hybrid I Antwerp or Amsterdam
  
  As an AI Engineer at Loop, you’ll play a critical role in
  transforming how our teams work by developing AI-driven
  tools that solve business challenges. Collaborating closely
  with internal stakeholders, you’ll turn complex needs into
  simple, scalable solutions. Whether it’s automating customer
  feedback analysis, streamlining campaign workflows, or
  building tools that improve asset creation, your work will
  directly influence how teams operate. By blending technical
  expertise with a deep understanding of our business, you’ll
  empower every department to achieve more—and faster. This is
  your chance to create tools that drive impact across the
  company.
  
  Build AI-driven tools that transform how we work
  
  We’re looking for an AI Engineer who takes full ownership of
  building impactful AI solutions—from scoping to deployment.
  You’ll design, develop, and ship production-ready systems
  that automate workflows, accelerate decision-making, and
  save hours across teams. Working closely with stakeholders,
  you’ll translate real business challenges into intelligent,
  scalable tools using NLP, LLMs, and agentic workflows.
  You’ll choose the right stack—Streamlit, FastAPI, Azure, or
  GCP—and ensure adoption through seamless integration and
  measurable outcomes. This is a hands-on, high-autonomy role
  where you’ll help define both the technical direction and
  engineering standards.
  
  Your responsibilities:
  
  - Develop AI-driven software to solve business challenges,
    integrating technologies like NLP, machine learning, and
    automation.
  - Build and deploy applications using open-source frameworks
    (Streamlit, Gradio, or FastAPI), so they can be used by
    other teams.
  - Create custom integrations using APIs and webhooks to
    connect AI solutions with internal systems.
  - Fine-tune LLMs for specific business applications.
  - Own projects and products end-to-end, from identifying
    opportunities to deployment, using first-principle
    thinking.
  - Stay ahead of AI trends and recommend new technologies to
    enhance our capabilities.
  
  How you’ll succeed as an AI Engineer
  
  Success in this role means combining technical excellence
  with creativity, autonomy, and leadership. You’ll take full
  ownership of projects—from defining scope and technical
  direction to driving measurable business outcomes like
  adoption, automation impact, and efficiency gains. You’ll
  set engineering standards, mentor teammates, and foster a
  culture of experimentation and excellence. Clear
  communication and collaboration with stakeholders will be
  essential as you translate complex challenges into simple,
  scalable solutions. By staying ahead of AI trends and
  sharing your knowledge, you’ll elevate the team and shape
  how Loop builds with AI.
  
  These key competences will set you up for success:
  
  - 5+ years of experience building AI/ML algorithms and
    solutions, and a degree in Computer Science or related
    field.
  - Highly proficient with Python, and with ML frameworks like
    PyTorch and scikit-learn.
  - Hands-on experience with Natural Language Processing (NLP),
    traditional ML, and LLMs.
  - Experience with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and
    model evaluation techniques essential for machine learning
    projects.
  - Familiarity with the latest in GenAI, including RAG, agentic
    workflows, MCP, A2A, tool use, function calling, and
    multi-modal systems.
  - Experience with DevOps practices, including CI/CD pipeline
    tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, Github Actions.
  - Experience with deployment on one of the major cloud
    providers (preferably Azure/GCP).
  - Understanding of various machine learning algorithms,
    including supervised and unsupervised learning,
    reinforcement learning, and neural networks.
  - Experience with MLOps, including monitoring and optimizing
    AI models for performance, scalability, and efficiency.
  
  Job evolution:
  
  - Within your first month, you’ll immerse yourself in Loop’s
    workflows and AI ecosystem—learning how different teams
    operate and identifying opportunities where AI can make
    the biggest impact. You’ll also help establish best
    practices for development, deployment, and collaboration,
    setting the foundation for scalable AI delivery.
  - By your third month, you’ll take ownership of an internal AI
    product, working closely with stakeholders to scope
    requirements, design system architectures, and build the
    first working prototypes.
  - By your sixth month, you’ll be leading multiple AI products
    from a technical perspective —owning one from concept to
    production deployment. You’ll have contributed to Loop’s
    growing library of internal AI tools, mentoring teammates
    and helping define the standards for how we build, deploy,
    and scale AI solutions across the organization.
