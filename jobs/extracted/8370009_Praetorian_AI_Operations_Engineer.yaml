  We Are Praetorian
  
  Praetorian is defined by raw intensity, fearless candor, and
  a relentless drive. This is who we are.
  
  We are looking for high-performing, mission-aligned
  individuals. We prioritize performance over politics and
  purpose over transaction. This environment is built for
  those who seek ownership and impact.
  
  Is Praetorian the right fit for you? If you are someone who
  obsesses over the problem, defaults to open communication,
  and wants to work with a team that refuses to accept
  mediocrity—then you have found your home.
  
  The Mission
  
  Praetorian is an expert-driven offensive security company.
  Our mission is to prevent breaches before they occur. We
  help organizations shift from an "assume breach" mentality
  to adopting offensive security as a core strategy of
  prevention.
  
  We don’t just find bugs; we solve the root cause. We are
  building a future without compromise, and we need people who
  run toward the fire.
  
  The Mission
  
  Praetorian is an offensive security company; our internal
  systems must be as sophisticated as the threats we hunt. We
  are seeking an AIOps Engineer who views manual tasks as
  technical debt and "standard operating procedures" as
  candidates for immediate automation.
  
  You will work alongside our engineering team to build an AI-
  native ecosystem that powers our SaaS offerings and elite
  Professional Services. Your goal is "Invisible
  Operations"—where systems are so automated, secure, and
  self-healing that they disappear into the background of a
  high-velocity engineering culture.
  
  Core Responsibilities: Learning and Building
  
  AI-Native Operations & Infrastructure You will lead the
  deployment of our Generative AI infrastructure, moving
  beyond "support tickets" toward self-service automation and
  agentic resolution.
  
  - Model Orchestration: Learn routing and orchestration for
    frontier models (Claude/Claude Code, Gemini, OpenAI) and
    open-source/distilled models (DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi) using
    tools like LiteLLM, AWS Bedrock, and n8n.
  - Agentic Frameworks & RAG: Build retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG) systems and agentic workflows that
    integrate with our internal knowledge base to streamline
    operations.
  - Developer Experience: Support the engineering team by
    integrating AI-driven CLIs and IDEs (Claude Code, Cursor,
    Codex) directly into the daily workflow.
  
  Cloud & Systems Engineering
  
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Treat the entire corporate and
    product environment as a codebase. You will contribute to
    the design, reliability, and security of these
    environments using Terraform, Pulumi, ClawdBot, or Devpod.
  - Cloud-First Architecture: We are an AWS-primary shop, but
    you must possess the eagerness to learn across GCP and
    Azure as needed. You will help build serverless, high-
    availability environments that scale.
  - SaaS Integration: Act as the integration engineer for our
    core stack (Salesforce, HubSpot, Linear, Notion, Google
    Workspace, Pave). If it has an API, you will automate it.
  
  Security & Identity
  
  - Security-First Architecture: Wear a tin foil hat and partner
    with our internal Red Teams to implement Zero-Trust
    networking and secure build pipelines. You will learn why
    low-latency environments matter for cracking and why
    security must be woven into the fabric of the
    architecture.
  - Identity Access Management (IAM): Help architect and
    automate the access management stack (Okta/Google
    Workspace/SSO). You will build the guardrails that allow
    rapid onboarding and access without sacrificing security.
  - Offensive Tooling Support: Support high-performance
    computing (HPC) and specialized networking environments
    specifically tailored for deep-tier penetration testing
    and adversarial simulations.
  
  Areas of Accountability: High Agency & Ownership
  
  - The "Learn-by-Doing" Mandate: You are accountable for the
    "last mile" of execution. You will write code, configure
    VPCs, and debug CI/CD pipelines alongside a small, elite
    team.
  - "Invisible IT" Execution: You will contribute to creating a
    friction-free employee experience—minimizing human
    intervention for access, hardware provisioning, and
    compliance.
  - Scalability & Performance: Help ensure internal systems can
    handle massive data requirements and rapid growth without
    sacrificing performance.
  
  Qualifications: The "Driven Builder" Profile
  
  We prioritize High Agency and Individual Drive over years of
  tenure. We want the person who builds side projects for fun.
  
  - Relentless Autodidact: You don't wait for a training manual.
    You have a proven track record of teaching yourself new
    technologies and turning ideas into working projects.
  - Polyglot Engineer: Strong foundation in Python or Go. You
    are eager to learn complex APIs, custom integrations, and
    low/no-code platforms to bridge gaps.
  - Cloud Native Passion: Demonstrated interest in AWS
    (Primary), with eagerness to learn Azure/GCP. Specifically
    passionate about serverless architectures, Kubernetes, and
    automated provisioning.
  - AI Pragmatist: You understand the difference between AI hype
    and high-utility automation. You have a passion for AI/ML
    frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, OpenAI SDK) and
    implementing secure AI usage policies.
  - MacOS & Device Engineering: Interest in macOS device
    management (MDM) and open-source software like Munki.
  
  Desired Behaviors
  
  - Automation Obsession: A consistent drive to review the
    current state and identify ways to automate and reduce
    friction.
  - Guardrail Construction: Building systems that prevent
    colleagues from accidentally granting too much access
    while keeping data secure.
  - Exceptional Rapport: The ability to make novice users
    comfortable asking for help while giving experienced
    engineers confidence in your growing technical abilities.
