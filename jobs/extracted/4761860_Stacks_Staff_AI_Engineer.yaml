  **This role is based out of our Amsterdam office 🇳🇱 or London office 🇬🇧**
  
  **We are an office-first company & believe great products are made when we are together.**
  
  **About Stacks**
  
  At Stacks, we’re transforming the way finance teams approach one of their most critical processes: the monthly close. For mid to large enterprises, the close is a painstaking, manual effort that pulls finance teams away from strategic initiatives to focus on repetitive, tedious tasks. We believe this needs to change.
  
  Our vision is bold. **With the power of AI, we’re reimagining the monthly close to be as simple as a single click**—providing the most accurate, detailed financial insights on day one of each month. By giving finance teams their time back, we enable them to focus on high-impact, strategic work that drives their companies forward.
  
  Our team is a blend of finance, product, and technical experts from top-tier companies like Uber, Plaid, Miro, Mollie, and Bunq, united by the drive to create a game-changing solution. Based in the heart of Amsterdam, our office offers inspiring views over the iconic canals. Backed by leading VCs and executives from Stripe, Plaid, and OpenAI, we’re ready to reshape the future of finance.
  
  **
  About the Role**
  
  We’re looking for a Staff AI Engineer to spearhead our AI and ML efforts. This is far from a typical engineering role - it’s an opportunity to build our machine learning and data function from the ground up. Financial data can be a goldmine that’s often buried and untapped, and we need someone with the expertise and tenacity to unlock its full value.
  
  You will be at the forefront, developing cutting-edge solutions to automate financial close workflows and surface key strategic insights. Beyond tackling fascinating machine learning challenges, you’ll also handle the foundational work - designing robust data pipelines and transforming messy, unstructured data into clean, valuable assets. If you’re passionate about diving deep into data, revel in both the glamorous and gritty aspects of ML, and want to make a significant impact on our product and company trajectory, this role is for you.
