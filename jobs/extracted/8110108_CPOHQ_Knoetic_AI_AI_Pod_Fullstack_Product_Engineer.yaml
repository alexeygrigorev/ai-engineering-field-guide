  ✨ TLDR ✨
  
  Join Knoetic ($50MM+ raised from Tier 1 VCs like Accel +
  Menlo + 100s of angels) as we launch an incredible series of
  new AI products.
  
  - You’ll join a newly-formed, high-intensity AI product pod.
    You’re not joining a well-oiled machine; rather, you’re
    going to help us build the machine in this small, elite AI
    pod.
  - You'll own features end-to-end as an IC, ship at incredible
    velocity, and have direct impact on a product used by
    1000s of C-level executives from Box, Brex, Notion,
    OpenAI, Figma, and more.
  - You must be an AI-native engineer who’s customer-centric.
    That means (1) you’re easily a top 10% user of tools like
    Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and more, and (2) you love
    creating delightful moments for our customers, whatever it
    takes.
  
  ❤️ Knoetic AI + our Chief People Officer network ❤️
  
  Our mission is to build the “Second Brain” for every Chief
  People Officer & their HR team. We're backed by $50MM from
  Accel, EQT, Menlo, and 100s of legendary angels (Adam Grant,
  Shreyas Doshi, etc).
  
  We're a beautiful blend of consumer + enterprise product
  that serves 1000s of C-level execs from companies like Box,
  Figma, dbt labs, Lyft, Notion, and OpenAI.
  
  You can learn more about our “right brain” (CPOHQ) and ”left
  brain” (AI & People Analytics) here.
  
  ✨ Overview ✨
  
  We're looking for a Fullstack Product Engineer who wants to:
  
  - Own features end-to-end, from deeply understanding the
    customer problem to shipping the feature and driving its
    usage & adoption.
  - Work across the entire stack (React, TypeScript, NestJS,
    PostgreSQL).
  - Ship fast & high quality; you believe speed vs. quality is a
    false choice, and in fact you can increase both in
    lockstep.
  - Work directly with customers: from hopping on calls, to
    debugging their problems, and then iterating based on real
    feedback
  - Craft positive-sum engineering practices that increase
    velocity.
  - Become one of the first 3 engineers in our AI & Analytics
    pod
  
  This is only an in-person role (4-5 days/week) in NYC. We
  have a beautiful office in a 1,000+ ft skyscraper in the
  heart of Hudson Yards, New York.
  
  ✨ About you & the role ✨
  
  - You have over-the-top ownership mindset. When something is
    your responsibility, it's truly yours. You understand it
    deeply, you're accountable for it in production, and you
    don't wait to be told what to do next. When something
    breaks, you're already investigating far before anyone
    asks.
  - You enjoy working with customers. Beyond just writing code,
    you’re deeply energized by understanding who you're
    building for. You love customer calls, and seeing how
    people actually buy & use what you build.
  - You are an AI-native engineer who’s far more productive
    because of AI. You live in Cursor, Claude Code, or similar
    tools. You can trade notes with us on prompting
    strategies, context management, and when to trust vs.
    verify AI output. You're 2-3x more productive because of
    how you use AI, and you have concrete proof points to back
    it up.
  - You’re driven to make things better, not just point at
    what's broken. You notice problems, but in a productive,
    positive way that includes "here's how I'd fix it." You'd
    rather propose an imperfect solution than complain or wait
    for someone else.
  - You can disagree and then commit… happily. You push back
    when you see a better way. But once the decision is made,
    you execute like it was your idea. No sulking, no
    relitigating, no behind-the-back undermining. You’re a
    team player in the end & you embrace the decision as if it
    were your own (because one day, you’ll be on the other
    side of the table too!)
  - You believe quality enables speed. You've seen what happens
    when teams skip tests and cut corners. The slowdown comes
    later, and it's worse. You write tests not because someone
    told you to, but because you want to deploy with
    confidence, and believe in quality & craft.
  - You communicate before it's a problem. You surface blockers
    early. You ask for help before you've wasted a day stuck.
    You don't surprise people with missed deadlines, because
    of your proactivity.
  - You review code like it matters. You leverage AI to catch
    bugs and suggest improvements, but you know where human
    judgment is essential. You don't rubber-stamp PRs because
    you're busy. Again… because craft & quality matters.
  
  ✨ What you'll do ✨
  
  - Ship features end-to-end from problem understanding to
    production, across frontend and backend
  - Talk to customers regularly: join calls, gather feedback,
    and translate their problems into solutions
  - Write code that lasts with tests, edge case handling, and
    clear documentation
  - Review code thoughtfully and hold the bar on quality for the
    team
  - Debug production issues and make sure they don't happen
    again
  - Help cultivate our engineering culture as one of the
    founding engineers of this pod
  
  ✨ Candidate Criteria ✨
  
  - You have 2-6 years building and shipping product. You've
    worked on real products with real users. You've felt the
    pain of production issues and learned from them.
  - You're strong across the stack. You can build a React
    component, write a backend service, and debug a database
    query. You might be stronger in one area, but you're not
    helpless in any of them.
  - You genuinely enjoy customer interaction. You've been on
    customer calls before and found them valuable, not
    painful. You understand that great products come from
    deeply understanding user problems.
  - Strong SQL knowledge is a plus. We build querying engines on
    top of Snowflake data—if you're comfortable writing and
    optimizing complex queries, that's a big advantage.
  - You're AI-native and AI-augmented. Cursor, Claude Code, AI-
    assisted reviews—these have fundamentally changed how you
    work. You're constantly experimenting with new AI tools
    and have opinions on what's worth adopting. If you're
    still coding the way you did in 2022, this isn't the right
    fit.
  - You have an owner's mindset. Self-driven, resourceful, ready
    to build and be in the trenches. You don't need to be
    managed; you need to be pointed at problems.
  - You've worked in high-intensity environments. Startups,
    high-growth teams, or any context where speed and quality
    both mattered.
  - You're a positive influence on every team you've been on.
    Low ego, high standards
  
  ✨ Tech Stack ✨
  
  - Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite
  - Backend: NestJS, TypeScript
  - Data: PostgreSQL, Redis
  - Infrastructure: AWS, GitHub Actions
  - Observability: Sentry, New Relic
  - AI Dev Tools: Cursor, Claude Code (or similar—we want to
    learn from you too)
  
  Nice to have: SQL proficiency and experience working with
  data warehouses (we use Snowflake for analytics).
  
  We don't expect you to know everything. We care more about
  your ability to learn and adapt than your familiarity with
  our exact stack.
  
  ✨ WHAT WE BELIEVE ✨
  
  - In this era of AI, we can (and will) build a billion-dollar
    company with a few dozen employees. This means every spot
    on this ship is sacred, and we will have an intensely high
    bar on recruiting (no hire > mediocre hire).
  - AI-augmented engineering is the new baseline. Engineers who
    aren't leveraging AI tools are already falling behind. We
    expect everyone to be constantly improving how they use AI
    to ship faster and better.
  - Great products come from talking to customers. We're not
    building in a vacuum. Engineers here talk to customers,
    understand their problems deeply, and build solutions that
    actually matter.
  - Quality is speed. Shipping fast doesn't mean shipping
    broken. Code without tests, missing error handling, or
    unclear logic creates drag that compounds over time. We
    move fast by building things that don't need constant
    fixing.
  - Ownership is non-negotiable. You own your work end-to-end.
    You don't throw problems over the wall. You don't wait to
    be told what to do.
  - Make it better, don't just point at it. Identifying problems
    is easy. We value people who follow up with solutions.
  - Disagree and commit. Debate is healthy. But once the
    decision is made, execute like it was your idea.
  - The bar is always rising. In today's rapidly evolving world,
    what's good today isn't good enough tomorrow.
