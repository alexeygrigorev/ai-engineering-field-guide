  What are we looking for?
  
  We’re seeking a Staff AI API Engineer specialized in backend
  systems and API development. This role requires deep
  expertise in Python-based API engineering, database
  architecture, distributed systems, and high-performance
  backend infrastructure. The ideal candidate will have proven
  experience designing, building, and maintaining production-
  grade APIs that integrate sophisticated AI functionality.
  
  What will you do?
  
  As a Staff AI API Engineer, you’ll join our globally
  distributed team to:
  
  - Develop and maintain high-performance Python-based backend
    APIs supporting our generative and agentic AI products.
  - Design and implement scalable, secure, and reliable backend
    architectures, leveraging technologies like asyncio,
    FastAPI, gRPC, Kafka, and GraphQL.
  - Ensure robust data management, incorporating relational and
    NoSQL databases, Redis caching, streaming, and efficient
    data handling.
  - Implement and manage secure zero-trust authentication and
    authorization schemes for public and internal APIs.
  - Collaborate closely with frontend engineers, AI researchers,
    product managers, and DevOps teams to deliver cohesive
    product experiences.
  - Optimize backend services for scalability, reliability, and
    performance in high-availability environments.
  
  What skills and experience should you bring?
  
  We're looking for experienced engineers passionate about
  building secure, high-performing backend systems, with:
  
  - A degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a
    related field, or equivalent practical experience.
  - 7+ years of professional experience developing scalable,
    production-quality Python backend services.
  - Expert-level proficiency with Python, asyncio, and backend
    API frameworks such as FastAPI, gRPC, and GraphQL.
  - Deep understanding of backend architectures, distributed
    systems, and microservices.
  - Experience managing database architectures (relational
    databases, NoSQL, Redis).
  - Strong expertise in authentication and authorization
    protocols (OAuth, JWT, OpenID Connect, etc.).
  - Proven track record interacting with third-party APIs and
    developing fail-safe integrations.
  - Familiarity with modern generative AI technologies (e.g.,
    OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Meta's LLaMA) and
    experience building backend integrations.
  - Excellent communication skills and a collaborative approach
    in globally distributed teams.
  
  Exceptional candidates will also bring expertise in:
  
  - Proficiency in languages beyond Python, including Go, Java,
    Kotlin, Rust, C++.
  - MLOps and AIOps practices and tools such as MLFlow, Airflow,
    or Weights & Biases.
  - Experience with cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP) and
    deployment tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, ArgoCD).
  - Experience optimizing API performance and scalability in
    production environments.
  - Background in cybersecurity, threat detection, or related
    fields.
  - Agile methodologies, including experience as a Technical
    Lead or Scrum Master.
