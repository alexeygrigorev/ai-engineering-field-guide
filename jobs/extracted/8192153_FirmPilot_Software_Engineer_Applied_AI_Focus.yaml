  About FirmPilot
  
  FirmPilot builds AI-powered systems that automate and scale
  real-world business outcomes. We focus on applied AI, using
  best-in-class large language models and tooling to deliver
  reliable, production-grade automation.
  
  We are not building bespoke foundation models. We are
  building systems that use AI effectively, which requires
  both AI expertise and strong software engineering.
  
  The Role
  
  We are hiring a Software Engineer with applied AI expertise
  to design and optimize the integration of LLMs into
  production systems.
  
  This role is for engineers who understand how LLMs behave in
  practice and can build repeatable, testable, API-driven
  workflows around them. This is not a role for casual AI
  experimentation or “prompt tinkering.”
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Design, implement, and evolve RAG pipelines combining
    structured data, embeddings, and LLMs.
  - Develop and maintain prompt strategies used across multi-
    step agent workflows.
  - Integrate LLMs into production systems with attention to
    reliability, cost, and latency.
  - Orchestrate AI-driven workflows across internal services and
    third-party APIs.
  - Define and improve practices for prompt versioning,
    evaluation, and iteration.
  - Work closely with platform engineers to ensure AI systems
    are maintainable and observable.
  - Help the team reason about when deeper customization or
    model-level work may be warranted in the future.
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - 5+ years of professional software engineering experience.
  - Strong backend experience with modern .NET and Python.
  - Demonstrated, hands-on experience with:
  - Experience integrating AI systems into real products, not
    just prototypes.
  - Ability to reason about trade-offs: determinism, accuracy,
    cost, and performance.
  - Strong communication skills and the ability to explain AI
    behavior clearly.
  
  Our Engineering Environment
  
  - Modern .NET (8 & 9), Python, TypeScript
  - GraphQL and REST APIs
  - LLMs, embeddings, and vector databases
  - Event-driven, agent-oriented architecture
  - AWS as our primary cloud provider
  - Terraform for infrastructure as code
  - CI/CD with automated testing and observability
  
  How We Work
  
  - AI systems are treated as production software, not
    experiments.
  - We move quickly by setting clear standards and iterating
    frequently.
  - Communication is frequent and expected, especially when
    behavior is unclear.
  - Engineers are expected to challenge assumptions and improve
    systems collaboratively.
  
  Not a Good Fit If…
  
  - You are looking for pure AI research or model training work.
  - You primarily use AI tools without understanding how they
    work internally.
  - You are uncomfortable debugging non-deterministic systems.
  - You prefer slow iteration or minimal ownership.
  
  Pursuant to applicable pay transparency requirements, the
  Company discloses in good faith that the anticipated salary
  range for this role is $135,000 to $162,000.
