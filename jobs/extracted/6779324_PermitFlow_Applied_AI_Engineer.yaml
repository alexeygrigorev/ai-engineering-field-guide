  PermitFlow is redefining how America builds. We’re an
  applied AI company serving the nation’s builders, tackling
  one of the largest information challenges in the economy:
  understanding what can be built, where, and how. Our AI
  agent workforce helps the fastest-growing construction
  companies navigate everything from permitting and licensing
  to inspections and project closeouts – accelerating housing,
  clean-energy, and infrastructure development across the
  country.
  
  Despite being a $1.6T industry, construction still suffers
  from massive delays, wasted capital, and lost opportunity.
  PermitFlow has already delivered unprecedented speed,
  accuracy, and visibility to over $20B in development,
  helping contractors reduce compliance time, de-risk
  projects, and scale with confidence.
  
  America is entering a CAPEX super-cycle, from data centers
  and factories to housing and renewables, and joining
  PermitFlow is building the AI at the heart of every
  construction project powering the next wave of re-
  industrialization.
  
  We’ve raised over $90M, most recently completing our Series
  B, from top-tier investors including Accel, Kleiner Perkins,
  Initialized, Y Combinator, Felicis, and Altos Ventures, with
  backing from leaders at OpenAI, Google, Procore,
  ServiceTitan, Zillow, PlanGrid, and Uber.
  
  Our HQ is in New York City with a hybrid schedule (3 in-
  office days per week). We prefer NYC-based candidates or
  those open to relocation.
  
  Role Overview
  
  As an Applied AI Engineer, you will design and deploy the AI
  agents that power PermitFlow’s pre-construction platform.
  You will own the full lifecycle of intelligent agents—from
  model development to orchestration, productionization, and
  evaluation—while contributing to core platform engineering.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Develop and deploy AI agents that automate permitting
    workflows end-to-end
  - Orchestrate multiple models and tools to create reliable,
    multi-step AI systems
  - Build the internal tools and infrastructure that power and
    monitor these agents
  - Design and implement backend and frontend services, APIs,
    and data pipelines, integrating AI functionality into
    user-facing features when needed
  - Contribute to system architecture and core platform design
    with the engineering team
  - Design and maintain a suite of evaluations and benchmarks to
    measure agent accuracy, reliability, and cost-
    effectiveness
  - Optimize inference pipelines and backend systems for speed,
    scalability, and cost
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - 3+ years in software or ML engineering post-BS/MS
  - Hands-on experience shipping production AI/ML systems or AI-
    powered products
  - Experience building multi-step ML systems, pipelines, or
    agentic workflows
  - Strong backend and API development skills, with some
    frontend experience
  - Track record of building reliable products with attention to
    quality and detail
  - Startup grit and comfort in fast-moving, evolving
    environments
  
  What We Offer
  
  - Competitive salary and meaningful equity in a high-growth
    company
  - Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage
  - Flexible PTO and paid family leave
  - Home office & equipment stipend
  - Hybrid NYC office culture (3 days in-office/week) with
    direct access to leadership
  - In-Office Lunch & Dinner Provided
