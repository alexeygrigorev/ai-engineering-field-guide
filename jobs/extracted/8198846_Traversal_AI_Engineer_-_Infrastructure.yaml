  About Traversal
  
  Traversal is the AI Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) for the
  enterprise—already trusted by some of the largest companies
  in the world to troubleshoot, remediate, and even prevent
  the most complex production incidents. Our mission is to
  free engineers from endless firefighting and enable them to
  focus on creative, high-impact work.
  
  Our roots remain deeply embedded in AI research, and we’re
  channeling that scientific rigor and creativity into
  building the premier AI agent lab for the enterprise. Hence,
  what we’re proudest of is assembling the most talented yet
  nicest group of individuals, including researchers from MIT,
  Harvard, and Berkeley, to world-class engineers from
  industry: Citadel Securities, Cockroach Labs, Datadog, DE
  Shaw, ServiceNow, Glean, Perplexity, Pinecone, and more, to
  take on one of the hardest problems for AI to solve. Without
  the entire team, none of this would be possible.
  
  The Role
  
  As an AI Infrastructure Engineer on the Platform /
  Reliability team, you’ll design, secure, and operate the
  core systems that power Traversal’s AI products. We already
  serve Fortune 50 enterprises with multi-tenancy and SOC 2
  Type II controls, and we’re rapidly scaling.
  
  You’ll focus on high-concurrency inference, Kafka data
  pipelines, and agentic tooling (via MCP) — building
  infrastructure that’s reliable under extreme load. This
  includes safe concurrency, graceful retries, queue
  management, autoscaling, observability, and Kubernetes-
  native scheduling.
  
  This is a senior, high-impact role: you’ll own foundational
  systems, work across Python, Rust, Kubernetes, and Kafka,
  and shape how enterprise AI reliability is built and scaled.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - System Design & Architecture: Design scalable, reliable
    infrastructure for AI inference, data pipelines, and
    agentic workflows.
  - Queue & Job Scheduling (K8s-native): Migrate from Python
    multiprocessing + Postgres-as-queue to Kubernetes-native
    queuing and orchestration (KEDA/HPA, Jobs/CronJobs,
    Kueue/Argo).
  - Managed Kafka Operations: Tune partitioning and throughput,
    design DLQ + replay runbooks, implement idempotent sinks
    to avoid duplicates
  - Autoscaling: Scale on real signals (queue lag, in-flight
    requests, latency); add burst capacity and safe drains
  - Per-Tool Reliability: Productionize MCP toolchains with
    circuit breaking, timeouts, sandboxing, and audit
  - Progressive Delivery: Implement canary and blue/green
    rollouts for stateful services, pre-warm caches/weights,
    and enable graceful termination
  - Observability: Build RED/USE dashboards and OpenTelemetry
    traces across gateway → agent → tool → Kafka → sinks
  - Infrastructure as Code: Evolve Terraform/Helm/Kustomize for
    multi-environment deployments, secrets, policy-as-code
    (OPA/Rego), and workload identity
  
  Requirements
  
  - 3+ years of experience at technically rigorous companies or
    teams
  - Proven experience operating high-concurrency backends with
    managed Kafka fan-in/out and at-least-once processing
  - Experience designing idempotent systems (outbox, dedupe
    keys, safe replay)
  - Production experience building and maintaining systems in
    Python and Rust (Rust 2024)
  - Incident response, chaos testing, capacity planning
  - Familiarity with AWS, EKS, Terraform, Helm/Kustomize
  - Strong debugging skills across runtime, Kafka, network, and
    auth layers
  - Security-minded, with experience implementing least
    privilege, default-deny egress, auditability, and policy-
    as-code
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - GPU workload operations (MIG, topology-aware placement),
    inference servers, token streaming gateways
  - Data governance (PII discovery/redaction), lineage,
    tokenization
  - Cross-region active/active for Kafka and stateless services
  - Service mesh (Envoy/Istio), Cilium/eBPF, ClickHouse for
    analytics

  We offer competitive compensation, startup equity, health
  insurance, and additional benefits. The U.S. base salary
