  Sxaler is the new global standard in exceptional talent
  acquisition for category-defining technology companies. We
  partner with the brave and the bold during the periods which
  matter most, and nothing less than exceptional talent is
  required to win.
  
  Our leaders are operators from unicorns for which they've
  scaled. Our clients choose us for the quality of our people,
  the wisdom of experience, and our record for rapid impact.
  
  We believe that AI-natural recruiters who balance input,
  intervention and empathy will redefine our profession. We
  look for people with unreasonable standards for excellence —
  high-agency operators who take ownership and win.
  
  We're hiring Founding Engineers for an AI startup in stealth
  mode, looking to disrupt a $100b+ market. The opportunity
  includes the chance to become the VP Engineering/CTO for the
  right person.
  
  The Founders are highly ambitious and experience operators,
  who have been part of multiple unicorn success stories
  previously and deeply understand the problem space.
  Sufficient private funding/runway to reach PMF and avoid
  external capital/dilution.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Work directly with the founders and functional experts to
    shape our early product offerings
  - Build a scalable, AI-native platform with potentially
    millions of users
  - Prototype and ship quickly, with direct input from early
    customers
  - Translate real-world workflows into intuitive user
    experiences
  - Help define the technical architecture and engineering
    culture from day one
  - Contribute to product strategy, customer discovery, and
    everything in between
  
  You Might Be a Fit If…
  
  - You’re a full-stack Product Engineer (or close to it) who
    loves building fast and shipping
  - You are tinkering constantly with AI, seeking to understand
    its utility and limitations
  - You default to action, care deeply about product, and are
    comfortable in ambiguity
  - You challenge assumptions and think from first principles
  - You want to build cutting-edge products which meaningfully
    accelerate humans and challenge archaic norms
  - You’ve worked in early-stage startups/scaleups and/or taken
    ideas from 0 → 1
  
  Why Join Now?
  
  - You’ll be among the first engineers
  - You’ll have tremendous influence around engineering choices
    and culture
  - You’ll work directly with thoughtful, scar-tissued operators
    and sharp engineers
