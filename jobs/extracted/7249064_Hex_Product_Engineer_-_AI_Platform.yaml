  engineering teams on integrating into the platform. The

  many thousands of people work with data, and give you a
  front-row seat to the most exciting technological shift in
  our lifetimes. As part of our AI Platform team, you’ll own
  the scalable agent infrastructure powering today’s most
  powerful data agents, as well as  the cutting-edge
  experimentation tooling that allows the rest of the team to
  rapidly deliver new AI features in the product.

  - At least 4+ years of software engineering experience.
  - Proficiency with React and Typescript in addition to
    knowledge around architecture and systems design.
  - Experience leading and executing on major product
    initiatives.
  - Excitement for getting your hands dirty and diving deep into
    how the browser works to develop high-quality and
    performant user experiences.
  - An aptitude for how web infrastructure works to develop
    high-quality internal developer and external user
    experiences.
  - An instinct for strategic thinking and aligning with
    business and product goals while keeping a healthy balance
    of velocity and engineering excellence.
  - Interest in the data space, and a love of shipping great
    products and building tools that empower end users to do
    more.
  - Experience maintaining a high quality bar for design,
    correctness, and testing.
  - An ability to lead product initiatives while collaborating
    and mentoring fellow engineers.
  - Curiosity and an interest in diving into the bigger picture
    of building a company, including go-to-market, customer
    development, people, and marketing.
  
  This role will be hybrid (1-2 days per week) based out of
  our San Francisco, California headquarters or NYC office.
  
  In addition to our unique culture, Hex proudly offers a
  competitive total rewards package, including but not limited
  to, market-benched salary & equity, comprehensive health
  benefits, and flexible paid time off.
  
  The salary range for this role is: $160,000 - $270,000
