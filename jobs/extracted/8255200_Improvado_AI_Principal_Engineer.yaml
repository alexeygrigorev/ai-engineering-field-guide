  Improvado is an AI-powered, unified platform designed for
  marketing teams in medium to large-scale enterprises and
  agencies, who are looking to automate complex marketing
  intelligence and reporting to make decisions with ease.
  Improvado gathers, organizes, and untangles marketing data
  to deliver instant insights through BI and AI, helping to
  eliminate complexity, delivering laser-focused insights to
  optimize budgets, enhance campaign efficiency and marketing
  ROI.
  
  As a rapidly scaling Series A startup that raised $34
  million in funding, we're proud to partner with globally
  recognized brands such as ASUS, Docker, Activision, H&R
  Block, and many others. Our diverse team of curious, open,
  and hard-working individuals is committed to cultivating a
  fast-paced, agile culture that values personal and
  professional growth.
  
  About the Role We're looking for a hands-on AI Principle
  Engineer to help us build the future of AI at Improvado.
  It’s a unique opportunity for someone excited to define the
  product vision based on real user needs and directly build
  the systems that power it. You’ll work closely with our CEO
  (who’s also our Chief Product Officer with a strong
  technical background) to drive the direction of our AI
  features. From high-level strategy to low-level
  implementation, you’ll bridge product thinking and deep
  engineering. You'll also help guide a small, talented team
  of AI engineers — mentoring, setting direction, and writing
  production code alongside them.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Co-own the AI product and technical roadmap with our CEO
  - Serve as the link between engineering and the business:
    ensure the team understands not just what to build, but
    why it matters
  - Design and implement key AI-powered features from the ground
    up
  - Drive technical architecture decisions and ensure high code
    quality and reliability
  - Write scalable, production-ready code and build intelligent
    agents using modern LLM frameworks
  - Define and track success metrics — from model performance to
    user satisfaction and adoption
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - A catalyst for action with a relentless drive for execution.
    We need a doer who thrives on speed and velocity, takes
    absolute ownership of outcomes, and is energized by a
    fast-paced environment
  - Strong product instincts and user empathy — you think beyond
    models and love solving real problems
  - Able to clearly communicate business context and product
    priorities to engineers — helping them build the right
    things, not just functional code
  - Deep experience building AI/ML systems, ideally with LLMs in
    production
  - Familiarity with the modern AI/LLM ecosystem
  - Hands-on knowledge of prompt engineering, vector databases,
    orchestration tools, and model evaluation pipelines
  - Clear communicator, comfortable leading discussions and
    making decisions
  - Previous startup or fast-paced environment experience is a
    plus
  
  What It’s Like to Work Here
  
  At Improvado, we’re a collaborative and ambitious team that
  moves fast and learns even faster. We believe in:
  
  - Velocity and speed of delivery
  - Clear ownership and high trust
  - Working on problems that matter
  - Staying flexible while delivering high-quality work
  - Building great things together, not in silos
  - We work across multiple time zones, with most collaboration
    centered around U.S. hours. We’re remote-first but value
    real-time collaboration and proactive communication.
  
  What We Offer
  
  - Remote-first environment
  - Competitive compensation
  - Paid PTO and holidays
  - Professional development reimbursement
  - Stock options
