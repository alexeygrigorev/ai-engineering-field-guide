  About the Role:
  
  We’re hiring a Staff Full-Stack Engineer to help drive the
  next generation of AI-powered healthcare experiences. This
  is a highly technical role with broad cross-functional
  impact. You’ll partner with product teams across the company
  — including Pharmacy, E-commerce, Care, and Core Platform —
  to design and ship AI-powered features for both external
  users and internal teams.
  
  You will set technical direction, lead architectural
  decisions, and create the foundational systems that enable
  fast, safe, and reliable AI development. This role is ideal
  for someone who enjoys fast iteration, values a product-
  driven mindset, and can balance high velocity with
  uncompromising standards for safety and quality.
  
  You Will:
  
  Lead architecture and platform development
  
  - Design and own core AI workflow platforms, orchestration
    systems, and shared SDKs that power intelligent healthcare
    experiences.
  - Build scalable, reliable systems for LLM orchestration,
    grounding, evaluation, and agent-like workflows.
  - Create reusable frameworks and patterns that other
    engineering teams can adopt across the company.
  - Drive multi-quarter technical initiatives and help bridge AI
    research prototypes with production-grade systems.
  
  Partner closely with Product across multiple verticals
  
  - Work with Pharmacy, E-commerce, Care, and Operations to
    bring AI-powered features to life, from patient-facing
    journeys to internal efficiency tools.
  - Collaborate on product strategy, helping translate ambiguous
    ideas into clear technical plans.
  - Support teams in releasing features quickly through
    incremental, high-velocity delivery cycles.
  - Ensure user-facing AI experiences meet expectations for
    performance, reliability and usability.
  
  Champion safety, privacy, and clinical integrity
  
  - Develop evaluation frameworks and observability systems that
    measure AI behavior, grounding, safety, and quality.
  - Establish guardrails and patterns that ensure all AI
    interactions comply with HIPAA, security-by-design, and
    privacy-first principles.
  - Work with clinical, legal, and AI safety partners to ensure
    our systems are trustworthy and appropriate for healthcare
    use.
  
  Elevate engineering excellence
  
  - Mentor engineers and help cultivate strong engineering
    practices across the Applied AI organization.
  - Lead design reviews and contribute to architectural
    governance across engineering teams.
  - Improve developer experience and remove platform bottlenecks
    that slow down product teams.
  - Raise the overall quality bar by championing clear standards
    for reliability, observability, testing, and iteration.
  
  Build and ship across the full stack
  
  - Develop features and infrastructure using TypeScript (AWS,
    Cloudflare Workers, React/Next.js) and Python (Databricks,
    orchestration, evaluation).
  - Integrate and evaluate LLMs and ML systems through unified
    AI gateway.
  - Build secure APIs and connectors that link to domains like
    EHR, Pharmacy, Payments, Orders, and Care.
  - Contribute to shared libraries that standardize schemas,
    tool contracts, and developer experience.
  
  You Have:
  
  - 8+ years of professional experience across backend services,
    frontend applications, distributed systems, and data/ML
    tooling.
  - Strong proficiency in TypeScript and Python, with experience
    building production systems in both languages.
  - Deep familiarity with LLM- or ML-based systems and the
    architectural patterns needed to operate them safely at
    scale.
  - Experience leading major technical initiatives that span
    multiple teams or product areas.
  - A product-driven mindset with a bias toward fast,
    incremental delivery and continuous learning.
  - Strong communication and collaboration skills across
    engineering, product, design, operations, and clinical
    teams.
  - A deep appreciation for safety, privacy, and security —
    ideally with experience in a regulated domain such as
    healthcare, fintech, or life sciences.
  
  Nice to Have:
  
  - Experience with Databricks, Cloudflare Durable Objects,
    vector databases, or edge-based AI orchestration.
  - Prior work on AI evaluation systems, LLM behavior
    monitoring, or safety frameworks.
  - Contributions to open-source SDKs or complex infrastructure
    projects.
  - Experience building tools that significantly increase
    developer velocity.
