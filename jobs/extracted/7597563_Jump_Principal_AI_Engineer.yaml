  Description
  
  Jump is transforming the live sports experience with the
  only end-to-end fan engagement platform built specifically
  for sports teams and venues. By focusing on aligned
  incentives between teams and fans, our platform unifies
  ticketing, merchandise, and game day operations - creating a
  smoother, more fan-friendly experience.
  
  Founded in 2021 by e-commerce innovator Marc Lore, MLB
  legend Alex Rodriguez, and entrepreneur Jordy Leiser, we’ve
  raised $60 million from top investors including Alexis
  Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six and Forerunner Ventures. Our
  platform powers teams across the NBA, WNBA, and NWSL helping
  them boost ticket sales and deliver innovative fan
  experiences.
  
  We’re a remote-first team driven by core values - begin and
  build with trust, play like the underdog, win as a team, and
  do your thing. If you’re collaborative, adaptable, and eager
  to shape the future of live sports, Jump is the place for
  you.
  
  The Role We’re looking for a Principal AI Engineer to expand
  the foundation for Jump’s AI-native future — building the
  infrastructure, tools, and culture that empower every
  internal team to move faster, work smarter, and deliver
  unforgettable experiences for sports fans. This role has two
  core missions:
  
  - Build AI infrastructure and internal tools. You’ll design,
    build, and deploy AI-powered systems and tools that enable
    our engineering teams to experiment, evaluate, and deliver
    high-quality solutions. In addition, you’ll create AI
    tools that support other departments — from product to
    finance — helping them leverage AI in their workflows.
    You’ll own the full lifecycle of these tools, from
    gathering requirements and building prototypes to
    iterating and deploying production-ready solutions.
  - Champion AI adoption across the company, teaching and
    evangelizing best practices to accelerate how every team
    leverages AI to do their best work.
  
  You’ll report to the CTO and work closely with senior
  leadership, engineering leads, and product teams to refine
  Jump’s AI foundations — from eval harnesses and context
  engineering frameworks to internal tools, and workflows.
  You’ll also lead rapid experimentation and internal demos
  that inspire and upskill the organization.
  
  What you’ll do:
  
  - AI Infrastructure & Internal Tools
    - Architect, build, and maintain Jump’s internal AI platform —
      including model evaluation frameworks, experimentation,
      context and prompt management systems, and fine-tuning
      pipelines.
    - Standardize and automate internal tooling: from Claude code
      org wide setup to orchestration frameworks for AI agents
      and workflows.
    - Design and deploy RAG systems, vector databases and other
      foundational components for production-grade AI systems.
    - Define best practices for evaluation and benchmarking of
      models and agentic workflows (including quality,
      reliability, latency, cost, and safety).
    - Develop templates and libraries for agentic workflows,
      memory, and tool use.
    - Partner with the engineering organization to integrate AI
      agents and features into Jump’s products.
    - Ensure reliability, observability, and scalability of AI
      systems across environments.
  - AI Organizational Enablement
    - Act as an AI subject matter expert — running workshops,
      demos, and internal talks to help every function apply
      AI to their workflows.
    - Lead rapid experimentation initiatives — identify and
      prototype high-impact internal AI use cases, then scale
      successful ones.
    - Partner cross-functionally with HR, Finance, and Client
      Services to design and deploy AI automations that save
      time and increase quality.
    - Maintain an internal AI playbook — a living repository of
      best practices, design patterns, and how-to guides for
      prompt engineering, context design, agent building, and
      evaluation.
    - Mentor engineers and product teams on effective use of LLMs,
      model selection, and architecture design.
  
  What you’ll bring:
  
  - 10+ years in software engineering or systems architecture,
    with 1+ years focused on AI/ML, LLMs, and agentic systems.
  - Full stack development experience.
  - Deep technical expertise with modern AI systems and
    frameworks — including Foundational models APIs, AWS
    Bedrock, N8N, Open Source Models, LangChain or similar.
  - Proven experience building and deploying AI infrastructure,
    including evaluation frameworks, monitoring, and agentic
    workflows.
  - Hands-on experience with vector databases, RAG systems, and
    context management for LLMs.
  - Strong proficiency in Python and TypeScript, with experience
    integrating APIs and orchestration tools.
  - Familiarity with cloud infrastructure (AWS),
    containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and IaC (Terraform,
    CloudFormation).
  - Experience fine-tuning LLMs.
  - Excellent communication and presentation skills —
    comfortable leading demos, training sessions, and internal
    talks for both technical and non-technical audiences.
  - A passion for teaching, experimentation, and scaling
    organizational impact through AI.
  
  Nice to have (but not required):
  
  - Experience building multi-agent systems.
  - Contributions to open-source AI tools.
  - Experience implementing internal developer platforms or
    productivity tools.
  
  Attributes that will make you successful on our team
  
  - A strong desire to learn. You continually look for ways to
    build your skills.
  - Tenacity. You enjoy working on challenges that others can’t
    or don’t want to tackle and you aren’t afraid of failing
    fast in order to find better solutions.
  - Passion. You love using your technical skills to build
    products that solve real problems. You hold yourself to a
    high standard and help to elevate others as well.
  - Empathy. You thrive in an environment where everyone can
    truly be themselves. You understand that our differing
    life experiences influence who we are and how we show up,
    and these diverse perspectives enrich both our team and
    our product.
  - Customer-centric mindset. You can understand the problem to
    be solved and who we are solving it for.
  - Innovation: Passion for exploring and implementing AI
    technologies to enhance automation, optimize workflows,
    and drive innovation
