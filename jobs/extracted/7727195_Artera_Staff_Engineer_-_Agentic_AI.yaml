  accelerate our work in agentic AI, MCP (Model Context
  Protocol) servers, and high-throughput distributed systems.
  
  This role reports directly to the VP of Engineering and is
  responsible for shaping platform architecture, driving
  technical excellence across teams, and leading execution on
  high-risk or high-impact initiatives critical to Artera’s
  long-term success. You will be a multiplier: architecting
  large-scale systems, mentoring engineers, and ensuring our
  platform remains resilient, performant, and ready for the
  next wave of AI-driven patient engagement.
  
  RESPONSIBILITES
  
  Technical Leadership
  
  - Serve as a domain expert in backend architecture,
    distributed systems, and high-throughput IO.
  
  - Drive company-wide architectural patterns, platform
    strategy, and engineering standards.
  
  - Lead execution on complex, open-ended projects spanning
    multiple quarters—including 2026 initiatives in agentic AI

  - Systematically reason through system-wide implications, edge
    cases, and performance trade-offs.
  
  - Identify and eliminate sources of instability, latency, and
    operational risk.
  
  - Build from scratch when needed—especially for distributed
    IO-intensive systems.
  
  Mentorship & Culture
  
  - Model engineering maturity through thoughtful code reviews,
    documentation, and technical communication.
  
  - Mentor engineers across teams; elevate their understanding
    of architecture, debugging, reliability, and AI-era best
    practices.
  
  - Foster a blameless culture that encourages learning,
    experimentation, and continuous improvement.
  
  - Champion transparency, clear communication, and strong
    cross-functional collaboration.
  
  Collaboration
  
  - Partner with product, design, and data/ML teams to translate
    complex technical ideas into practical, user-centered
    solutions.
  
  - Provide architectural guidance on story-level decisions
    within your domain.
  
  - Advocate for engineering-focused improvements in process,
    tooling, reliability, and developer experience.
  
  Requirements
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in STEM
  - 10+ years of equivalent professional experience building and
    scaling cloud-native applications
  - Deep experience with event-sourced, microservice, and
    distributed architectures
  - Expert at integrating LLMs and agentic tools like Claude
    Code to automate and enhance development workflows.
  - Advanced TypeScript skills, focusing on building scalable,
    type-safe, and high-performance backend services.
  - Expert in Node.js and NEST, with a focus on modular system
    design and enterprise-level API structures.
  - Advanced proficiency in SQL, especially PostgreSQL schema
    design and optimization
  - Experience with asynchronous, high-volume messaging or
    event-driven systems
  - Strong commitment to testing, observability, and operational
    excellence
  - Excellent communicator—able to influence stakeholders and
    product
  - Proven ability to lead technical initiatives and mentor
    engineers
  - Strong customer empathy and an understanding of how
    technical decisions influence user experience
  - Familiarity with Docker & containerized environments, AWS
    (or similar cloud providers), Python (for platform tools,
    services, or ML integrations)
  
  Bonus Experience
  
  - Experience with large-scale remote/hybrid teams
  - Contributions to open source
  - Collaboration/contributions with the open source community
  
  Security Requirements for Engineering Roles
  
  This engineering role contributes to a secure, federally
  compliant platform. Candidates must be eligible for a
  government background check and operate within strict code
  management, access, and documentation standards. Security-
  conscious development and participation in compliance
  practices are core to the role.
  
  OUR APPROACH TO WORK LOCATION
  
  Artera has hybrid office locations in Santa Barbara, CA, and
  Philadelphia (Wayne), PA, where team members typically come
  in three days a week. Specific frequency can vary depending
  on your team's needs, manager expectations and/or role
  responsibilities.
  
  In addition to our U.S. office locations, we are
  intentionally building geographically concentrated teams in
  several key metropolitan areas, which we call our “Hiring
  Hubs.” We are currently hiring remote candidates located
  within the following hiring hubs:
  
  - Boston Metro Area, MA
  
  - Chicago Metro Area, IL
  
  - Denver Metro Area, CO
  
  - Kansas City Metro Area (KS/MO)
  
  - Los Angeles Metro Area, CA
  
  - San Francisco / Bay Area, CA
  
  - Seattle Metro Area, WA
  
  This hub-based model helps us cultivate strong local
  connections and team cohesion, even in a distributed
  environment.
  
  To be eligible for employment at Artera, candidates must
  reside in one of our hybrid office cities or one of the
  designated hiring hubs. Specific roles may call out location
  preferences when relevant.
  
  As our hubs grow, we may establish local offices to further
  enhance in-person connection and collaboration. While there
  are no current plans in place, should an office open in your
  area, we anticipate implementing a hybrid model. Any future
  attendance expectations would be developed thoughtfully,
  considering factors like typical commute times and access to
  public transit, to ensure they are fair and practical for
  the local team.

  Company benefits - Full health benefits (medical, dental,
  and vision), flexible spending accounts, company paid life
  insurance, company paid short-term & long-term disability,
