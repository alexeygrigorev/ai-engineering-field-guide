  AI Engineer  The Opportunity Our next frontier is a
  strategic shift: We're evolving beyond traditional analytics
  to build AI agents that actively participate in our
  operations. Rather than using data to inform decisions,
  we're creating intelligent systems that autonomously deliver
  better outcomes for customers and clients alike. You will
  build the systems that transform our data from a passive
  record into an active participant, learning from history to
  autonomously optimise the business. You'll be our first
  dedicated AI engineer, working directly with the Head of
  Data. You'll collaborate weekly on architecture, especially
  in the first 6 months, to define the technical roadmap.
  You'll own the build, but you're not figuring this out
  alone. We have a small data science team shipping
  traditional ML such as lead scoring. Your remit is
  production of GenAI systems. However, we intentionally
  overlap deployment patterns, monitoring standards, and
  evaluation approaches so we build one coherent AI
  capability. What you will do
  
  - Architect & Engineer Agentic Systems
    - Build agents that act, not just answer: You will design
      agents that perform deterministic actions based on
      probabilistic reasoning. This means building systems
      that can reliably analyse data, execute function calls,
      and manage state across multi-step workflows without
      getting stuck in loops.
    - Production-Grade RAG: You will go beyond basic vector
      search. You will implement hybrid search (keyword +
      semantic), re-ranking strategies, and metadata filtering
      to ensure our agents have the exact context they need to
      make decisions.
    - Structured Data Extraction: You will build pipelines that
      turn unstructured conversations into structured data
      that our downstream systems can use.
  
  - Establish AI Engineering Foundations
    - Observability First: You will implement the "nervous system"
      of our AI. You will choose and set up tools (e.g.,
      LangSmith, LangFuse, ADK, or custom) to trace execution
      chains, giving us visibility into why an agent made a
      specific decision.
    - Evals as a Service: You will build the testing harness. You
      will create automated evaluation pipelines that test
      prompts against "Golden Datasets" so we can deploy with
      confidence, ensuring a prompt change doesn't degrade
      performance.
    - Cost & Latency Engineering: You will monitor token usage and
      inference latency, optimising the trade-off between
      model intelligence and speed/cost for different parts of
      the chain.
  - Collaborate and Standardise
    - Partner on Architecture: You will work with the Head of Data
      to define the technical roadmap. You aren't just taking
      tickets; you are helping decide what we build based on
      technical feasibility and business value.
    - Unify with Data Science: You will define shared standards
      with our Data Science team on deployment patterns,
      monitoring, and security, ensuring we build one coherent
      AI platform, not silos.
  
  What This Role Requires:  Must Have
  
  - Python and service development: You write clean, typed,
    production-ready code. You are comfortable with Pydantic
    (for data validation), Asyncio (for handling concurrent
    model calls), and FastAPI. You treat prompts as code:
    versioned, tested, and decoupled from business logic.
  - Cloud-native experience: You have hands-on experience
    deploying and operating containerised services on AWS (or
    GCP/Azure) using CI/CD platforms (Jenkins, GitHub Actions,
    CircleCI, BuildKite), cloud monitoring tools (Datadog,
    Sumologic, NewRelic), and container orchestrators (EKS,
    ECS). You're comfortable with Terraform for infrastructure
    as code.
  - Hands-on LLM experience: You've built something real with
    language models, whether production systems, serious side
    projects, or internal tools. You understand that prompting
    is engineering, not magic.
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Production GenAI at scale: Experience with structured
    outputs, managing context window constraints, and handling
    model latency/timeouts in user-facing applications. You
    know how to evaluate a change in prompt logic before
    deploying it.
  - Observability and evaluation pipelines: You've implemented
    tracing for LLM workflows or built automated evaluation
    against golden datasets.
  
  Important Traits
  
  - Proactive Ownership & Communication: GenAI projects are
    prone to hype. You have the confidence to manage
    stakeholder expectations effectively, explaining trade-
    offs between cost, latency, and quality. When blocked, you
    don't just ask for help, you present options.
  - Translating "Fuzzy" to "Formal". Marketing problems are
    often vague ("Find better leads"). You can take a fuzzy
    business objective and break it down into a deterministic
    engineering problem: a set of tools, a prompting strategy,
    and a metric to measure success.
  - Pragmatism over Hype. You read the AI research papers, but
    you deploy what works. You'd rather use a simple few-shot
    prompt that is reliable and cheap than a complex
    autonomous agent framework that is flaky and expensive.
    You understand that "boring" code is easier to debug.
  
  The Tech Reality  The Foundation (Fixed & Reliable) We
  believe in "innovation tokens". We spend them on the AI
  application layer, not the infrastructure.
  
  - AWS: ECS/Fargate, ECR. We prioritise velocity over
    complexity. CI/CD pipelines and Terraform to deploy,
    essentially shipping containerised services without the
    operational headache of managing raw Kubernetes clusters.
  - Data Layer: Snowflake & dbt. Our data is modeled, clean, and
    accessible. You won't spend your first 3 months scraping
    PDFs; you have rich, structured data ready to consume.
  
  The Canvas (Your Architectural Decisions) The "AI Layer" is
  currently undefined. You will work with the Head of Data to
  select the stack that fits our specific agentic needs.
  
  - Model Strategy: Totally open. We're pragmatic: we use
    whatever model offers the best trade-off for the task, and
    build the necessary infrastructure to access it securely.
  - Orchestration: Do we use a framework like LangChain or
    LlamaIndex, or do we write lightweight, controllable
    Python code? That's your call.
  - Observability: How do we trace complex agent workflows?
    Options include LangSmith, LangFuse, or custom solutions.
    You will choose the tool that gives us the best visibility
    into "why did the bot do that?"
  - Retrieval/Memory: Do we use a vector database like Pinecone
    or Weaviate? Do we leverage Snowflake Cortex for native
    vector search to keep data in one place? How do we handle
    long-term agent memory?
  - Evaluation: How do we unit test a prompt? You will define
    the frameworks and "Golden Datasets" we use to measure
    success.
  
  What We Offer
  
  - Architectural Authority: As the first hire, you define the
    patterns and standards, not inherit legacy debt.
  - Engineering Leverage: You have the resources for proper
    tools (LangSmith, Model APIs) and access to clean data
    immediately.
  - Strategic Partnership: You work with the Head of Data as a
    technical co-founder for internal AI products, shaping the
    roadmap together.
