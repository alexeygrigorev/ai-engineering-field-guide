  About Lendable
  
  Lendable is on a mission to build the world's best
  technology to help people get credit and save money. We're
  building one of the world’s leading fintech companies and
  are off to a strong start:
  
  - One of the UK’s newest unicorns with a team of just over 700
    people
  - Among the fastest-growing tech companies in the UK
  - Profitable since 2017
  - Backed by top investors including Balderton Capital and
    Goldman Sachs
  - Loved by customers with the best reviews in the market (4.9
    across 10,000s of reviews on Trustpilot)
  
  So far, we’ve rebuilt the Big Three consumer finance
  products from scratch: loans, credit cards and car finance.
  We get money into our customers’ hands in minutes instead of
  days.
  
  We’re growing fast, and there’s a lot more to do: we’re
  going after the two biggest Western markets (UK and US)
  where trillions worth of financial products are held by big
  banks with dated systems and painful processes.
  
  Join us if you want to
  
  - Take ownership across a broad remit. You are trusted to make
    decisions that drive a material impact on the direction
    and success of Lendable from day 1
  - Work in small teams of exceptional people, who are
    relentlessly resourceful to solve problems and find
    smarter solutions than the status quo
  - Build the best technology in-house, using new data sources,
    machine learning and AI to make machines do the heavy
    lifting
  
  About the team
  
  We are seeking an AI Engineer to join our Data Science team
  where we’re building our capabilities to service our
  customer operations with Generative AI, including a chatbot
  that supports customer service, various schema extraction
  tools automating document parsing, and more agentic process
  automation.
  
  About the role
  
  You will own the systems that safely streamline business
  processes using LLMs and generative AI. You’ll work on
  projects including:
  
  - Improving our internal chatbot that supports customer ops
  - Expanding our in-house schema extraction pipelines for
    faster, more accurate document parsing automation
  - Designing LLM-driven workflows that streamline various case
    management workflows
  - Identifying new opportunities where GenAI can radically
    simplify how we operate
  
  This role blends applied AI engineering, business-process
  design, and hands-on Python development. You’ll be working
  on problems that don’t have perfect definitions, where
  ambiguity is normal and creativity is essential.
  
  In this role, you will
  
  - Build real, production GenAI systems - not demos - that
    directly shape how a leading fintech operates
  - Work with LLMs, retrieval systems, agents, and automation
    pipelines on a daily basis
  - Own your solutions from idea → prototype → production
    deployment → monitoring
  - Work in small, autonomous teams that ship fast and give you
    real decision-making power
  - Redesign legacy processes from scratch using AI instead of
    patching around them
  - Bring curiosity, resourcefulness, and a desire to replace
    manual work with smarter systems
  
  Key skills
  
  - Strong Python engineering skills, comfortable building
    production-grade systems
  - Hands-on experience using LLMs in real workflows
  - Ability to design, evaluate, and iterate on prompts,
    retrieval pipelines, and agentic flows
  - Understanding of business processes and an instinct for
    simplifying or automating them
  - Comfortable working with ambiguity, quickly testing
    hypotheses, and refining ideas with partial information
  - Skilled at breaking poorly defined problems into structured
    steps and deciding when/how to bring AI into the loop
  - Clear communicator who can articulate trade-offs and
    influence stakeholders
  
  The interview process
  
  - Introductory call
  - Take-home exercise
  - Walkthrough of your exercise
  - Meet the team you’ll work with day-to-day
  - Meet our exec team
  
  Life at Lendable
  
  - The opportunity to scale up one of the world’s most
    successful fintech companies.
  - Best-in-class compensation, including equity.
  - You can work from home every Monday and Friday if you wish -
    on the other days, those based in the UK come together IRL
    at our Shoreditch office in London to be together, build
    and exchange ideas.
  - Enjoy a fully stocked kitchen with everything you need to
    whip up breakfast, lunch, snacks, and drinks in the office
    every Tuesday-Thursday.
  - We care for our Lendies’ well-being both physically and
    mentally, so we offer coverage when it comes to private
    health insurance
  - We're an equal-opportunity employer and are looking to make
    Lendable the most inclusive and open workspace in London
