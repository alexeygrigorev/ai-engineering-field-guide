  Summary
  
  Headquartered in sunny Los Angeles, GrayMatter Robotics is a
  well-capitalized AI robotics startup serving the
  manufacturing industry. We empower shop floor workers with
  our smart robots that assist with tedious and ergonomically
  challenging tasks, specifically in automated surface
  finishing. Our proprietary GMR-AI™ software is integrated
  with state-of-the-art industrial robots, sensors, and tools
  to create application-specific turnkey solutions for
  customers through a Robot-as-a-Service (RaaS) model.
  
  You will join the Special Projects: AI team at GrayMatter
  Robotics, a cross-functional group responsible for
  designing, building, and operationalizing AI capabilities
  across GMR’s products and customer deployments. The team
  serves as a horizontal AI function, working across
  simulation, data, perception, inspection, learning-based
  control, process optimization, and system validation to
  enable robust autonomy for GMR’s robots and factories in
  high-mix manufacturing environments. The team operates end-
  to-end from problem formulation and data strategy to model
  development, simulation, deployment, and long-term
  performance monitoring collaborating closely with robotics
  software, solutions engineering, applications, process
  engineering, hardware, and deployment teams. The team’s
  mandate is to ensure that AI systems scale across processes,
  customers, and sites, and perform reliably on real robots in
  real factories, today, not just in controlled
  demonstrations.
  
  This role values strong technical depth and sound research
  judgment, but places a clear priority on system ownership,
  execution, and measurable business impact. Publishing and
  external technical contributions are encouraged when they
  naturally emerge from deployed systems while meaningfully
  advancing both GMR’s products and the broader robotics
  community; however, successful delivery, robustness, and
  customer-visible outcomes are the primary measures of
  success.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Design, implement, and train state-of-the-art AI models for
    perception, inspection, decision-making, and control in
    real-world robotic manufacturing systems.
  - Lead the development of simulation-based tooling used across
    a broad range of AI use cases at GMR, including
    reinforcement learning for recipe learning, scalable
    synthetic data generation, and autonomous robotic cell
    setup.
  - Own and advance synthetic data generation pipelines,
    leveraging generative AI techniques for complex 3D
    geometry and environment, physics-based simulation, and
    image data, and scaling them across diverse processes and
    applications.
  - Develop and deploy multi-modal inspection and health
    monitoring systems, integrating vision, 3D sensing,
    force/torque, and other sensor modalities.
  - Bridge the gap between simulation and reality, ensuring
    models trained in simulation transfer robustly to physical
    robotic cells.
  - Optimize, deploy, and maintain ML models on production
    robotic systems, considering latency, reliability, and
    hardware constraints.
  - Troubleshoot complex, cross-disciplinary issues spanning ML
    models, simulation environments, robotics software,
    sensors, and hardware.
  
  Minimum Qualifications
  
  - Master’s Degree or PhD in Computer Science, Robotics,
    Mechanical Engineering or a closely related field plus 5-8
    years of experience.
  - Strong proficiency in Python is required; candidates with
    strong working knowledge of both Python and C++ in
    robotics systems will be preferred.
  - Deep expertise in machine learning and deep learning, with
    hands-on experience using frameworks such as PyTorch.
  - Demonstrated experience working with real robotic
    manipulators, including deploying and testing machine
    learning models on physical robots operating in real-world
    environments.
  - Demonstrated experience working with simulation environments
    and/or physics-based modeling for robotics (e.g., Isaac
    Lab or MuJoCo).
  - Strong software engineering discipline, including writing
    clean, maintainable, well-tested, and performance-
    optimized code.
  - Proven ability to diagnose and solve ambiguous, system-level
    problems and iterate quickly under real-world constraints.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Experience with synthetic data generation and simulation-
    driven dataset creation for perception and inspection
    tasks, including the use of generative models such as
    Gaussian Splatting, diffusion models, or flow matching-
    based approaches.
  - Deep understanding and hands-on experience using physics
    engines and robotics simulation platforms (e.g., Isaac
    Lab, MuJoCo) to solve complex real-world robotics
    problems.
  - Experience with reinforcement learning, imitation learning,
    or policy optimization for robotic manipulation or process
    control.
  - Hands-on experience with 3D data (point clouds, meshes,
    SDFs, CAD-derived geometry) and related tooling.
  - Exposure to robotics inspection or quality assurance
    problems involving multimodal sensing (e.g., vision +
    force, vision + acoustics, vision + tactile, etc.).
  - Experience with robotics middleware and tooling (e.g.,
    ROS/ROS 2) and deployment on real robotic hardware.
  - Prior experience working in industrial, manufacturing, or
    high-mix automation environments.
  - A publication track record, or demonstrated interest in
    publishing applied research in venues such as ICRA, CoRL,
    RSS, IROS, RA-L, or T-RO, balanced with a strong bias
    toward real-world production impact.
