description: |
  Airbnb was born in 2007 when two hosts welcomed three guests
  to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 5
  million hosts who have welcomed over 2 billion guest
  arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every
  day, hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it
  possible for guests to connect with communities in a more
  authentic way.
  
  The Community You Will Join:
  
  The Tools & Technologies Experience (TNT) team sits at the
  center of Airbnb’s digital employee experience
  transformation. We bring together engineering, product
  thinking, business processes, and knowledge management to
  reimagine how employees interact with their work. Our
  mission is to make internal tools smarter, workflows more
  seamless, and employee decisions more data-driven and
  personalized.
  
  As part of TNT, you’ll join a curious, collaborative, and
  ambitious team committed to building the future of employee
  experience through the strategic use of AI.
  
  The Difference You Will Make:
  
  In this role, you will architect the next generation of
  Airbnb’s internal operating system by designing and building
  intelligent, AI-powered solutions that address real Employee
  Experience (EX) pain points. You will translate ambiguous HR
  and workforce needs into scalable products, stitch together
  systems and data flows, and rapidly build prototypes that
  demonstrate what’s possible.
  
  You’ll be expected to move fluidly between engineering,
  product strategy, systems architecture, and narrative
  storytelling. You’ll independently build working prototypes
  - agent flows, lightweight apps, LLM-driven assistants -
  that can progress from concept to stakeholder testing in
  days, not months, and that can evolve into production-ready
  solutions with minimal lift from partner teams.
  
  This is a highly entrepreneurial role that requires zooming
  between high-level EX systems thinking and hands-on
  implementation. You’ll partner closely with EX, BizTech,
  Legal, Privacy, and InfoSec to ensure solutions are
  innovative, ethical, and securely designed.
  
  A Typical Day:
  
  - Translate employee and manager workflows into well-defined
    AI product opportunities
  - Rapidly prototype and test working solutions (LLM agents,
    workflow automations, microapps, embedded tools, etc.)
  - Architect systems integrations across our HR tech stack
    (Workday, Greenhouse, Qualtrics, Airtable, RightAnswers,
    Asana, and more)
  - Lead discovery sessions with stakeholders to uncover
    automation and augmentation opportunities
  - Evaluate third-party AI tools and determine build vs. buy
    options
  - Design and execute fast-cycle pilots across knowledge
    management, decision support, communications, and resource
    planning
  - Define success metrics, measure impact, and iterate based on
    user feedback
  - Translate complex AI architectures into clear narratives
    that help stakeholders understand value and adoption paths
  - Ensure alignment with Airbnb’s privacy, security, and
    ethical AI guardrailsContinuously evolve EX’s AI strategy
    as organizational needs and technologies shift
  
  Your Expertise:
  
  - 9+ years in product management, AI engineering, and/or
    platform architecture, with hands-on experience building
    and launching AI/ML-powered products
  - Proven 0→1 builder with extensive experience developing
    GenAI prototypes, tools, and platforms from scratchAbility
    to produce functional prototypes (using Claude Code or
    similar) within hours and stakeholder-ready demos within
    days
  - Strong systems-thinking skills with the ability to map
    complex workflows, diagnose root causes, and design
    buildable solutionsExpertise in prompt engineering,
    context orchestration, and adapting LLM behavior to
    different users, workflows, and decision contextsData-
    informed decision-maker who can define success criteria,
    measure ROI, and refine models and workflows
  - Skilled in communicating technical concepts to non-technical
    audiencesHighly collaborative, systems-oriented, and adept
    at connecting dots across people, tools, and processes
  - Strong visual and narrative communication skills (Figma,
    Miro, slideware)
  - Portfolio of prototypes or relevant 0→1 work preferred but
    not required
