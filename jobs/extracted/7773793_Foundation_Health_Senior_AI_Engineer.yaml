  **About Foundation Health**
  
  Foundation Health is transforming healthcare through an AI-powered digital pharmacy platform that seamlessly connects operational infrastructure with high quality patient experiences. Our mission is to transform patient centric care by connecting fragmented infrastructure, optimizing care coordination, and removing friction from the patient journey.
  
  This ambitious vision is only achievable with the dedication of the right team propelling us forward. We firmly believe that a supportive and inspiring work environment fuels creativity, transforming it into groundbreaking innovation. It is this very innovation that not only benefits our organization but also positively impacts our people, partners, and most importantly, our patients.
  ****The Role****
  
  As a Senior AI Engineer at Foundation Health, you will play a pivotal role in designing and delivering production-grade AI solutions that power and differentiate our product suite. This role combines technical leadership with solution architecture, requiring not just strong engineering capabilities, but also the ability to understand customer needs, identify opportunities, and design scalable, reliable, and compliant AI systems that create business value.
  
  You’ll work cross-functionally with product, engineering, sales, and operations teams, and engage directly with enterprise clients to translate their needs into AI-powered solutions. This is a high-impact role, ideal for someone eager to own entire solution verticals and lead implementation end-to-end from concept and experimentation to deployment and optimization.
  
  We are a lean, fast-paced team, and you’ll be joining us at a foundational stage, playing a key role in shaping our AI strategy, infrastructure, and internal automation efforts. Your contributions will directly influence how we build, deploy, and scale intelligent systems, while also helping define our engineering culture and technical practices. While we primarily work remotely, we value strong collaboration and make time for regular in-person connection to stay aligned and build momentum as a team.
  
  This is a high-impact individual contributor role, ideal for someone focused on deep technical and functional growth. While future leadership opportunities may arise, this role is primarily for those who want to own and deliver impactful work hands-on.
  
  ****What You'll Be Doing****
  
  As Senior Engineer focused on AI you’ll:
  
  - 
  
  Lead the design and implementation of production-grade AI systems across diverse problem spaces (e.g., classification, personalization, generation, search, forecasting).
  
  - 
  
  Work across the stack: data pipelines, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.
  
  - 
  
  Collaborate with product and engineering teams to apply ML/AI effectively to real-world use cases, balancing ambition with practicality.
  
  - 
  
  Define and evolve our ML infrastructure and tooling: model tracking, CI/CD for ML, serving patterns, A/B testing, etc.
  
  - 
  
  Build lightweight prototypes to test ideas, and production systems to scale impact.
  
  - 
  
  Participate in code reviews, technical planning, and architectural decisions
  
  - 
  
  Share on-call responsibilities for the systems you build
  
  ****Who We're Looking For****
  
  We’re looking for candidates with strong real-world experience building AI systems that ship and deployed to add value. You should be confident across the stack, from experimentation to production.
  
  **Essential**
  - 
  
  6+ years of total software development experience
  
  - 
  
  4+ years of professional experience building and deploying ML/AI systems
  
  - 
  
  Solid programming experience in Python (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, etc.) and familiarity with modern backend stacks (e.g., Typescript, Node.js, Go, or similar). Excellent writing and editing skills, with the ability to create clear, compelling content tailored to professional audiences
  
  - 
  
  Strong understanding of machine learning principles (supervised/unsupervised learning, evaluation, overfitting, data leakage, etc.)
  
  - 
  
  Experience deploying models in production environments using cloud infrastructure (GCP preferred).
  
  - 
  
  Familiarity with containerized workflows (Docker preferred) and serverless architectures
  
  - 
  
  Exposure to modern MLOps tooling (e.g., MLflow, Vertex AI, SageMaker, or equivalents).
  
  - 
  
  Comfortable working autonomously in a remote-first team, with excellent written and verbal communication skills.
  
  - 
  
  Available to travel to the US for onsite client meetings
  
  **Desirable**
  - 
  
  Experience across multiple AI subdomains: NLP, recommendation systems, time series, or computer vision
  
  - 
  
  Experience with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or integrating with foundation models (OpenAI desirable)
  
  - 
  
  Experience in event-driven systems and streaming data architectures
  
  - 
  
  Familiarity with A/B testing and experimentation platforms
  
  - 
  
  Exposure to regulated industries, especially healthcare (HIPAA, HL7, FHIR, etc.) - a bonus, not a requirement
