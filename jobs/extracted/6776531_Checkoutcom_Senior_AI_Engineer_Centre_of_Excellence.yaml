  Company Description
  
  We’re Checkout.com – you might not know our name, but
  companies like eBay, ASOS, Klarna, Uber Eats, and Sony do.
  That moment when you check out online? We make it happen.
  
  Checkout.com is where the world checks out. Our global
  network powers billions of transactions every year, making
  money move without making a fuss. We spent years perfecting
  a service most people will never notice. Because when
  digital payments just work, businesses grow, customers stay,
  and no one stops to think about why.
  
  With 19 offices spanning six continents, we feel at home
  everywhere – but London is our HQ. Wherever our people work
  their magic, they’re fast-moving, performance-obsessed, and
  driven by being better every day. Ideal. Because a role here
  isn’t just another job; it’s a career-defining opportunity
  to build the future of fintech.
  
  Job Description
  
  As a Senior AI Engineer within Checkout.com’s AI Centre of
  Excellence, you will drive the adoption of cutting-edge
  Generative AI technologies to transform how we operate and
  innovate. You will mentor peers, set engineering best
  practices, and shape Checkout.com’s AI strategy, while also
  designing, building, and deploying AI solutions that enhance
  products and streamline business processes in collaboration
  with cross-functional teams.
  
  How you’ll make an impact:
  
  - Partner with product managers, data scientists, and
    engineers to research, validate, and deliver high-impact
    Generative AI use cases.
  - Design and build APIs and microservices that integrate AI
    capabilities into internal and external workflows.
  - Develop, fine-tune, and deploy LLM-based applications (e.g.,
    chatbots, assistants, knowledge extraction tools).
  - Architect scalable AI infrastructure on cloud platforms
    (AWS, GCP, or Azure), leveraging containerisation and IaC.
  - Implement CI/CD pipelines and enforce best practices for
    secure, compliant AI deployment.
  - Build intuitive interfaces that enable teams to interact
    effectively with AI-driven features.
  - Continuously optimise performance, reliability, and
    scalability of AI systems.
  
  What we're looking for:
  
  - Hands-on experience with LLMs (e.g., GPT, BERT, Llama,
    Gemini) and applying them to real-world problems.
  - Strong backend engineering expertise, including RESTful APIs
    and micro-services design.
  - Proficiency in Python/JavaScript and familiarity with AI
    frameworks (e.g., LangChain, PydanticAI).
  - Solid understanding of cloud computing (AWS, GCP, or Azure),
    containerisation (Docker, Kubernetes), and Infrastructure-
    as-Code (Terraform).
  - Proven problem-solving skills and ability to thrive in fast-
    paced environments.
  - Excellent communication and collaboration skills across
    diverse teams.
  
  Preferred qualifications:
  
  - Proficiency in C# or Java.
  - Frontend development experience with JavaScript/TypeScript
    and frameworks such as React.
  - Experience developing Generative AI applications, including
    model fine-tuning and prototyping.
  - Awareness of ethical AI practices and emerging standards in
    AI governance.
  - Track record of rapid prototyping with measurable ROI.
  - Familiarity with distributed systems and large-scale data
    processing.
  - Contributions to open-source projects or a strong GitHub
    portfolio.
  - High technical curiosity and eagerness to learn new
    platforms.
  - Experience in the payments industry (a strong plus).
