  As a Senior Gen AI Engineer, Salesforce Platform you will
  lead the development of AI-powered solutions across our
  Salesforce platform to streamline end-to-end business
  operations. Partnering with the Manager of Salesforce
  Operations and the Principal AI Architect, you will
  implement orchestrated AI agents using Salesforce Einstein,
  Agentforce, and DataCloud, and deliver secure, scalable
  solutions via Apex, Visualforce, Lightning Web Components,
  and robust APIs.
  
  You will leverage generative AI to enhance efficiency,
  reduce manual work, and create smarter systems and workflows
  across our organization.  Candidates with a deep
  understanding of business operations and workflows are
  strongly preferred.  You will play a critical role in
  delivering AI solutions and frameworks that drive
  transformative business value.  This is a unique opportunity
  for full-stack development to experiment and solve for
  multiple use cases, as well as an opportunity to help
  educate business stakeholders on the power of AI solutions.
  
  You will:
  
  - Design, develop, and deploy generative AI solutions that
    modernize business operations—automating workflows,
    surfacing insights, and delivering intelligent
    recommendations with a balance of speed, functionality,
    and long-term scalability.
  - Build, integrate, and operationalize AI agents and
    automations using Salesforce Agentforce (skills, actions,
    orchestration, guardrails) embedded within Sales, Service,
    and CPQ workflows.
  - Implement Einstein/Agentforce solutions, including prompt
    flows, tools, and custom actions grounded in Salesforce
    Data Cloud for personalized retrieval and contextual
    experiences.
  - Develop and secure APIs (REST/SOAP, Platform Events,
    Pub/Sub) to connect Salesforce with internal and external
    systems such as CPQ, CLM, provisioning, licensing, ERP,
    and finance platforms.
  - Engineer data interoperability across systems—collaborating
    with architects and data teams to break down silos, build
    ETL pipelines, and establish automated data workflows.
  - Build and deploy retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
    patterns within Salesforce, implementing data indexing,
    grounding, safety measures, and evaluation loops.
  - Collaborate closely with the Principal Architect and
    Principal AI Engineer to translate high-level business
    objectives into production-ready AI-powered solutions,
    ensuring alignment with architectural and engineering best
    practices.
  - Prototype rapidly to validate new generative AI use cases
    and transition successful proofs-of-concept into stable,
    scalable, maintainable production applications.
  - Contribute to full-stack development efforts—from API design
    to front-end UI—when implementing AI features across
    various business systems.
  - Drive and contribute to CI/CD pipelines, code reviews, and
    release management using modern tooling (SFDX, GitHub
    Actions, Azure DevOps, etc.).
  - Ensure compliance, data security, and governance across all
    AI and integration solutions, including considerations for
    PII, data residency, consent management, and auditability.
  - Partner with business stakeholders (technical and non-
    technical) to understand requirements, gather feedback,
    and continuously improve AI-driven capabilities.
  - Work alongside data scientists and AI specialists to
    evaluate and optimize prompt strategies, fine-tune models,
    and implement organization-specific AI enhancements.
  - Lead knowledge sharing and enablement, mentoring teams and
    fostering adoption of AI technologies throughout the
    organization.
  - Monitor, evaluate, and iterate on AI solution performance to
    ensure quality, accuracy, and measurable business value.
