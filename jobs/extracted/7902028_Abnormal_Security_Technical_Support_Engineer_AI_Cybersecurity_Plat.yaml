  About You
  
  You’re an experienced, customer-obsessed technical support
  professional with a passion for solving complex problems in
  high-stakes environments. With 4+ years of experience,
  you’ve developed a track record of supporting enterprise
  customers, driving technical investigations, and advocating
  for continuous product improvement.
  
  You're energized by the evolving threat landscape in email
  and SaaS security, and you’re excited to support a platform
  that uses behavioral AI to stop the attacks others miss.
  You're equal parts communicator, troubleshooter, and
  customer champion—committed to delivering exceptional
  support and building customer trust at every step.
  
  What You Bring:
  
  - 4+ years in technical support roles, ideally in
    cybersecurity, enterprise SaaS, or API-driven platforms.
  - Strong knowledge of email security fundamentals, SaaS
    platforms, and cloud ecosystems like Microsoft 365, Google
    Workspace, Slack, Okta, Splunk, Crowdstrike, Cortex SOAR,
    Rest API or Zoom.
  - Proven ability to debug complex technical issues, analyze
    logs, and collaborate cross-functionally with Engineering
    and Product teams.
  - Excellent written and verbal communication skills, with the
    ability to explain technical concepts to both technical
    and non-technical stakeholders.
  - Familiarity with support and collaboration tools such as
    Salesforce, Jira, and Confluence.
  - A mindset for continuous learning, efficiency, and improving
    both the customer experience and internal support
    processes.
  - Experience using AI tools (e.g., GPT-based assistants,
    internal chatbots, or AI-powered support platforms) for
    troubleshooting or prompting is a strong plus.
  
  In This Role, You Will:
  
  - Act as a trusted L1 technical advisor for enterprise
    customers using Abnormal’s Cloud Email Security, AI
    Security Agents, and SaaS Security.
  - Own and resolve inbound support tickets—including
    configuration issues, API questions, behavioral false
    positives, and threat investigations.
  - Provide customers with clear, timely updates, root cause
    insights, and solution recommendations that reinforce
    product confidence and trust.
  - Collaborate closely with Engineering to ensure timely, high-
    quality resolutions and robust post-mortem documentation.
  - Support seamless customer onboarding and engagement by
    working alongside Customer Success Managers.
  - Create and maintain internal and external knowledge base
    content to improve case deflection and empower customers.
  - Identify patterns in support interactions to flag recurring
    pain points and drive product improvements.
