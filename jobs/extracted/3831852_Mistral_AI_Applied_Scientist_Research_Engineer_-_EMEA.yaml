  About The Job
  
  Mistral AI is seeking Applied Scientists and Research
  Engineers to drive innovative research and collaborate with
  clients on complex research projects.
  
  You will develop SOTA models across different modalities
  such as text, image, and speech. By developing novel methods
  and research ideas you will apply these models across a
  diverse set of use cases and domains. Working cross-
  functionally with both external and internal science,
  engineering, and product teams you will deliver high-impact
  AI solutions that turn the needle.
  
  What you will do
  
  • Run pre-training, post-training and deploy state of the
  art models on clusters with thousands of GPUs. You don’t
  panic when you see OOM errors or when NCCL feels like not
  wanting to talk.
  
  • Generate and curate data for pre-training and post-
  training, working on evaluations and making sure the model’s
  performance beats expectations.
  
  • Develop the necessary tools and frameworks to facilitate
  data generation, model training, evaluation and deployment.
  
  • Collaborate with cross-functional teams to tackle complex
  use cases using agents and RAG pipelines.
  
  • Manage research projects and communications with client
  research teams.
  
  About you
  
  • You are fluent in English, and have excellent
  communication skills. You are at ease explaining complex
  technical concepts to both technical and non-technical
  audiences.
  
  • You’re an expert with PyTorch or JAX.
  
  • You’re not afraid of contributing to a big codebase and
  can find yourself around independently with little guidance.
  
  • You write clean, readable, high-performance, fault-
  tolerant Python code.
  
  • You don’t need roadmaps: you just do. You don’t need a
  manager: you just ship.
  
  • Low-ego, collaborative and eager to learn.
  
  • You have a track record of success through personal
  projects, professional projects or in academia.
  
  It would be great if you
  
  • Hold a PhD / master in a relevant field (e.g.,
  Mathematics, Physics, Machine Learning), but if you’re an
  exceptional candidate from a different background, you
  should apply.
  
  • Can bring a variety of research experience (agents, multi-
  modality, robotics, diffusion, time-series).
  
  • Have contributed to a large codebase used by many (open
  source or in the industry).
  
  • Have a track record of publications in top academic
  journals or conferences.
  
  • Love improving existing code by fixing typing issues,
  adding tests and improving CI pipelines.
