  and learning opportunities abound!
  
  Apiphani is dedicated to creating a diverse and inclusive
  work environment for all as a fundamental component of our
  business. Diversity and inclusion are the bedrock of
  creativity and innovation. Without diversity of experience
  and thought, we would fail to progress as a company and as a

  Senior Software Engineer — Agentic AI Platform
  
  Location: Remote | Full-time | Competitive Compensation
  
  Apiphani is building the future of intelligent
  infrastructure automation through agentic AI. We’re looking
  for a Senior Backend Engineer to help design and build the
  systems that power Luumen — an AI-driven automation platform
  used by enterprise IT and managed service providers around
  the world.
  
  This is a high-impact, zero-to-one engineering role focused
  on building the backend foundations for large-scale AI
  orchestration. You’ll work on distributed systems that
  combine traditional infrastructure automation with large
  language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation
  (RAG), and intelligent agents.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Design and implement backend services that enable
    intelligent agent workflows and autonomous infrastructure
    actions
  
  - Develop APIs and orchestration layers in Python and
    TypeScript, integrating LLMs, vector databases, and
    observability pipelines
  
  - Build scalable systems to support LLM-based reasoning,
    retrieval, and decision-making across cloud infrastructure
  
  - Integrate with AWS Bedrock and other LLM platforms to
    support multi-model capabilities
  
  - Develop data access and semantic search layers using vector
    databases (e.g., pgvector, Pinecone, Qdrant)
  
  - Build robust monitoring, testing, and CI/CD systems to
    ensure reliability and reproducibility of AI workflows
  
  - Collaborate closely with the product and DevOps teams to
    design architecture diagrams, plan deployments, and
    monitor system health
  
  - Write clean, maintainable code with clear documentation and
    strong adherence to security and performance best
    practices
  
  - Participate in code reviews, design discussions, and
    iterative delivery cycles to improve product velocity and
    quality
  
  
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - 6+ years of backend engineering experience in production
    environments
  
  - Strong proficiency in Python and TypeScript for building
    distributed, event-driven systems
  
  - Deep understanding of AWS services (Lambda, ECS, Bedrock,
    S3, CloudWatch, etc.)
  
  - Experience designing APIs, microservices, and event
    pipelines that interface with LLMs or AI models
  
  - Familiarity with vector databases and concepts like
    embeddings, similarity search, and retrieval-augmented
    generation
  
  - Experience with infrastructure-as-code tools such as
    Terraform or AWS CDK
  
  - Understanding of SQL and schema migration workflows
    (PostgreSQL or similar)
  
  - Hands-on experience with Docker, GitHub Actions, and cloud-
    native CI/CD workflows
  
  - Ability to diagram systems, communicate architecture
    decisions clearly, and work asynchronously in a
    distributed team
  
  - Strong sense of ownership and ability to deliver in fast-
    moving, ambiguous environments
  
  
  
  Bonus Points
  
  - Experience working with LangChain, OpenAI, or Anthropic APIs
  
  - Familiarity with agentic frameworks or AI orchestration
    systems
  
  - Background in observability or APM tooling (e.g., Datadog,
    Dynatrace)
  
  - Prior experience building automation or infrastructure
    management tools
  
  - Contributions to open-source LLM or MLOps projects
  
  - Interest in shaping how AI is applied to real-world IT
    operations
  
  
  
  Why Join Apiphani
  
  You’ll be joining a globally distributed, high-performing
  team focused on redefining how enterprises manage
  infrastructure. Every feature you build will directly impact
  how engineers interact with intelligent systems in
  production environments.
  
  This is an opportunity to help architect the foundations of
  a platform that blends infrastructure automation, AI, and
  agentic reasoning — where your technical decisions will
  shape the next generation of enterprise operations.
