  Hi there! Thanks for stopping by 👋
  
  Are you actively looking for a new opportunity? Or just
  checking the market? Well… you might just be in the right
  place!
  
  We’re forming a new squad at Lightspeed focused on building
  AI-powered tools and capabilities. This includes working
  with LLMs, agent frameworks, and other emerging AI
  technologies to build internal tools, extend our product
  suite with new AI features, and help other teams across the
  company adopt AI effectively.
  
  You’ll be part of a highly collaborative and innovative team
  of developers, product managers, and designers. Your role
  will involve backend engineering—especially in our Spring
  Boot Java ecosystem—while also exploring and applying modern
  AI techniques to solve real problems. This is a hands-on
  engineering role and we are specifically looking for a
  versatile Java developer with a passion for Artificial
  Intelligence. Whether your experience comes from a
  professional background applying LLMs /AI technologies or
  from a deep personal curiosity for generative AI projects,
  we want to hear from you.
  
  What you’ll be responsible for
  
  - Building and maintaining backend services and APIs in a
    Spring Boot Java environment
  - Designing and implementing AI-powered tools and product
    features
  - Collaborating with other teams to help them integrate LLMs
    and AI patterns
  - Exploring and applying LLM capabilities such as
    summarization, classification, RAG, and prompt pipelines
  - Writing clean, maintainable, and well-tested backend code
  - Ensuring reliability, performance, and scalability of the
    systems you build
  - Staying up to date with developments in the AI space and
    sharing insights with your team
  
  Who you are
  
  You’re excited about building practical, AI-enabled systems
  that make work easier and products better. You enjoy solving
  hard problems with clean code and clear thinking. You’re
  curious about AI and open to learning new patterns,
  frameworks, and tools.
  
  You bring deep backend experience, work well in teams, and
  care about building things that are actually useful.
  
  Requirements
  
  - At least 5 years of experience in backend development
  - Proven technical leadership
  - Strong Java and Spring Boot experience in production
    environments
  - Solid understanding of REST APIs, databases (SQL/NoSQL), and
    system architecture
  - Familiarity with Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes
  - Strong communication and collaboration skills
  - Comfortable writing well-structured, maintainable code
  - Professional experience building or integrating AI-powered
    systems in production, including work with LLM APIs (e.g.
    OpenAI, Claude), prompt engineering, or agent frameworks.
  - Experience building internal tools or customer-facing AI
    features
  
  What will increase your chances
  
  - Experience with one additional backend language (especially
    Python)
  - Familiarity with observability tools and performance
    monitoring
  - Understanding of security, access controls, and API
    standards
  - Knowledge of vector search, semantic retrieval, or document
    indexing
  
  What’s in it for you
  
  - Lots of autonomy, flexible work culture
  - Genuine career growth opportunities within a company that's
    continuously expanding
  - Make a meaningful impact by helping teams and customers work
    more effectively with AI
  - Be part of a team large enough for growth yet agile enough
    for real impact
  - Work on high-traffic products with a global user base
  - Opportunity to work alongside other highly skilled
    engineers, learn and expand your skill set, forge
    wonderful relationships and make your mark within the
    diverse and inclusive Lightspeed culture, a true Canadian
