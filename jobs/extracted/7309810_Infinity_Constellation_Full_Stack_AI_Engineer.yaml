  **AI Engineer (Contract-to-Hire)**
  
  **Location:** Remote (Global)****Start Date:** Rolling
  **Compensation:** $75/hour for first 4 weeks (contract-to-hire trial)
  
  Please apply using the provided form, candidates who directly email will not be considered.
  
  About The Project**
  
  We're building AI-native engineering team within **Infinity**, a holding company building full-stack AI businesses. We support portfolio companies by:
  
  - 
  
  Rapidly prototyping new product ideas to validate markets
  
  - 
  
  Providing flex capacity during high-growth phases
  
  - 
  
  Maintaining and evolving the **Infinity Commons**, our shared library of frameworks, prompts, and reusable tools
  
  We’re not a dev shop. We’re a surgical team of builders who move fast, reduce ambiguity, and create leverage across a network of founders building with AI at the core.
  **The Role**
  
  We’re looking for **scrappy, sharp, execution-focused engineers** who thrive in high-context, high-autonomy environments. You'll be deployed on fast-moving projects—from validating ideas in one-week sprints to helping scale production tools inside early-stage companies.
  
  This is a **contract-to-hire role**. The first month is a paid trial at $75/hour. If there’s mutual fit, you’ll transition to a full-time or retainer-based role within the core team.
  **What You’ll Do**
  - 
  
  Build working prototypes of agentic AI applications, LLM workflows, and full-stack products
  
  - 
  
  Experiment quickly across frameworks (e.g. LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen), open source tools, and low-code stacks
  
  - 
  
  Interface directly with product thinkers and founders to distill ambiguous ideas into testable code
  
  - 
  
  Contribute to shared internal libraries and the Infinity Commons
  
  - 
  
  Occasionally embed with portfolio companies to support launches or unblock execution
  
  **What We’re Looking For**
  
  **Required:**
  
  - 
  
  Fluency in **Python** and experience using AI toolkits and APIs
  
  - 
  
  Experience rapidly building and iterating on **proof-of-concept or MVPs**
  
  - 
  
  Comfort using a **blend of commercial APIs, open source, and low-code tooling** to get things done
  
  - 
  
  Strong **problem-solving skills** and analytical intuition
  
  **Bonus Points:**
  
  - 
  
  Prior work with **AI agents**, vector databases, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
  
  - 
  
  Experience with **frontend development** (React, Next.js, etc.)
  
  - 
  
  A background in a **STEM discipline**, data science, or quant-heavy engineering
  
  - 
  
  Previous experience in a **venture-backed startup** or technical founder role
  
  **How We Work**
  - 
  
  Asynchronous by default, with tight feedback loops and clear ownership
  
  - 
  
  High-trust, high-autonomy culture that values shipping, learning, and iterating
  
  - 
  
  Small, elite team of senior builders with experience across AI, product, and infrastructure
  
  **How to Apply**
  
  Send us:
  
  - 
  
  A short note in the application form on why this role fits you Links to past work, projects, or GitHub.
  
  - 
  
  Availability to start the contract phase
  
  We’ll move quickly. If it feels like a fit, you’ll be coding real things with us within a week.
