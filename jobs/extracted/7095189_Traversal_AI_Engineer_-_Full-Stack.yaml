  About Traversal
  
  Traversal is the AI Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) for the
  enterprise—already trusted by some of the largest companies
  in the world to troubleshoot, remediate, and even prevent
  the most complex production incidents. Our mission is to
  free engineers from endless firefighting and enable them to
  focus on creative, high-impact work.
  
  Our roots remain deeply embedded in AI research, and we’re
  channeling that scientific rigor and creativity into
  building the premier AI agent lab for the enterprise. Hence,
  what we’re proudest of is assembling the most talented yet
  nicest group of individuals, including researchers from MIT,
  Harvard, and Berkeley, to world-class engineers from
  industry: Citadel Securities, Cockroach Labs, Datadog, DE
  Shaw, ServiceNow, Glean, Perplexity, Pinecone, and more, to
  take on one of the hardest problems for AI to solve. Without
  the entire team, none of this would be possible.
  
  The Role
  
  As a Full-Stack AI Engineer at Traversal, you’ll play a key
  role in designing and building core features powered by our
  AI site reliability engineer. From the user interface to the
  backend and infrastructure, you’ll develop product
  components to enable real-time incident detection, root
  cause analysis, and automated remediation in some of the
  most complex production environments. This role will focus
  on the ability to work across the full pipeline of our
  product, and someone who can have a strong product sense
  while also being comfortable working around AI and data
  processing infrastructure will be the best fit.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Product Impact: Translate AI-powered insights into user-
    friendly features that empower engineers and reduce
    cognitive load.
  - User Experience: Innovate and drive the evolution of UX/UI
    design, rapidly iterating based on user feedback to
    improve overall usability.
  - API Development: Design and implement high-performance APIs
    to enable seamless communication between backend systems
    and frontend interfaces.
  - Data Management: Ensure efficient data storage, retrieval,
    and processing, leveraging technologies like PostgreSQL,
    Redis, or others.
  - AI Integration: Collaborate with AI engineers/researchers to
    integrate AI-driven insights and solutions into backend
    systems, and take ownership of API authentication and
    authorization frameworks.
  - Data Visualization: Develop intuitive interfaces for
    presenting and interacting with complex time-series and
    topological data.
  
  Requirements
  
  - 3+ years of software engineering experience, with a strong
    focus on full-stack systems.
  - Proven ability to lead in fast-paced startup environments,
    with limited resources, shifting priorities, and minimal
    structure.
  - Strong experience with Python and web frameworks such as
    FastAPI.
  - Hands-on experience with React, TypeScript, Next.js, and
    TailwindCSS to build fast, responsive, and maintainable
    frontends. React experience is essential, but we’re happy
    to support learning the other tools.
  - Experience deploying applications on AWS, working with ECS
    or Kubernetes, Postgres for data storage, and S3 for
    large-scale object storage.
  - Note: You don’t need to meet every single requirement. If
    you have deep experience in a subset of these areas, we
    encourage you to apply.
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Familiarity with Python-based ecosystems is a plus.
  - Experience working with Agentic AI systems or in the
    observability domain.
  - Background in large-scale, complex, data-driven
    applications.
  - Familiarity with AI or LLM-powered products.
