  What we do
  
  Saccharo AI builds human‑centric, agentic workflows that
  help organizations capture more large-scale sales
  opportunities through RFPs (Requests for Proposals). We’ve
  closed our angel round, are proving product‑market fit with
  pilot customers, and are scaling toward general release.
  
  The RFP‑software market has already topped $1.5 billion and
  is on track to more than double this decade, underscoring a
  once‑in‑a‑generation chance to modernize how proposals are
  won. We plan to become the partner of choice for teams ready
  to ride this inflection point.
  
  Saccharo’s platform ingests unstructured RFP documents,
  surfaces the must‑win opportunities, and orchestrates
  AI‑driven workflows—retrieval, qualification, and strategy
  generation—that let proposal managers focus on high‑value
  thinking instead of copy‑paste drudgery.
  
  We’re looking for an AI‑savvy engineer to help us extend
  these custom data pipelines, refine our retrieval systems,
  and train collaborative agentic models that keep our
  customers a step ahead.

  What you’ll do
  
  - Build & maintain data pipelines for ingestion, cleaning, and
    embedding of unstructured proposal content
  - Prototype, fine‑tune, and evaluate open‑weight LLMs;
    implement retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) for
    grounded answers
  - Deploy models behind scalable APIs and monitor latency,
    cost, and drift
  - Embed responsible‑AI controls (e.g., privacy, transparency,
    bias checks)
  - Collaborate cross‑functionally with product, sales, and
    customer SMEs to translate user pain points into
    ML‑powered features
  - Mentor team members on best practices; contribute to
    engineering playbooks and code review rituals
  
  Who you are
  
  - 3 + years of Python in production (Pandas, FastAPI,
    PyTorch/TensorFlow)
  - Hands‑on experience with cloud infra (Docker, CI/C) and
    vector databases (Pinecone)
  - Track record shipping ML models from experiment to prod; LLM
    or NLP domain preferred
  - Strong written communication; able to document experiments
    and draft lightweight RFCs
  - Bias toward action, low ego, and eagerness to work
    shoulder‑to‑shoulder with the CTO
  
  Where you’ll work
  
  We are committed to attracting the broadest range of
  abilities and insights, regardless of where candidates are
  geographically located. We will consider both fully remote
  candidates and those within commuting distance of our NYC
  headquarters who would have hybrid, flexible work
  arrangements.
  
  Benefits & Perks
  
  - Competitive total compensation ($150,000)
  - Meaningful equity (0.5%)
  - Medical, dental, vision
  - Flexible PTO + annual company recharge week
  - $1 k annual learning stipend
