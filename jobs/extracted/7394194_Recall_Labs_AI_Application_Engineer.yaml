description: |
  We are on a mission to responsibly accelerate the value of information and intelligence across society. We are pioneering a decentralized skills markets, and approach to scalable AI evaluation and discovery that we believe can do for AI what PageRank did for the web - usher in more trust, transparency, and vibrancy. 
  
  You’d join a lean, passionate, senior team on the cutting edge of AI and decentralized technology. We look for high agency, integrity, and excellent communication as we aim to empower every person to move the needle on our huge mission. 
  
  **The Opportunity**
  
  As an** AI Applications Engineer** at Recall Labs, you will bridge cutting-edge AI research and practical implementation, translating breakthrough products and approaches into production-ready products that change how AI is evaluated and discovered. You'll experiment rapidly, have massive autonomy and impact, and help shape how AI is developed and steered for the benefit of humanity. You are likely deeply embedded in AI product advances, attuned to the AI research community, and constantly evaluating new architectures, training techniques, and paradigms.
  
  **What You'll Achieve:**
  
  - **Drive** the identification and prioritization of **3-5 high-potential experiments** based on the newest research developments, serving as the **key driver of experimental flow** and ensuring **cutting-edge techniques** (e.g., novel prompting strategies, reasoning approaches, or model optimizations) are evaluated and integrated to **measurably improve product performance**
  
  - **Build and maintain** a **comprehensive experimentation infrastructure** that enables the team to **run AI-facilitated experiments at scale**, combining **AI evals with A/B testing capabilities** to empower **rapid experimentation and evaluation** across the product
  
  - **Drive high-impact product releases** powered by AI innovations, **translating cutting-edge research into shipped features** that **demonstrably improve user experience** and **key product metrics**
  
  - **Accelerate engineering adoption** of AI capabilities across the organization by working closely with the CTO to **integrate AI tooling into internal workflows**, enabling engineers to **leverage AI effectively** in their day-to-day work and **ship research-driven features**
  
  - **Establish a culture of AI expertise** and knowledge sharing by **identifying and disseminating high-potential research**, helping **build team capabilities** in AI evals, context engineering, and related areas through **consistent contribution and fast-follow implementation**
  
  **Skills You'll Need:**
  
  You’re likely a great fit if you have:
  
  - Deep familiarity with the** current AI landscape**, particularly in evaluations, reasoning systems, agentic architectures, and context engineering techniques
  
  - Demonstrated track record of **shipping high impact product working with AI**, with at least 5 years of engineering experience (across any engineering domains).
  
  - **Exceptional programming skills**, speed, and AI-first workflows
  
  - **Experience with experiment design**, A/B testing, statistical analysis, and using data and experiments to drive product decisions.
  
  - **Working knowledge of model deployment**, inference optimization, and scaling considerations. Proficiency with API integrations across multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, open-source models)
  
  - You're obsessed with staying on the leading edge of **AI research**—whether through personal projects, open source contributions, implementing the latest papers, or being deeply engaged in AI communities—and you can't help but experiment with new techniques as they emerge
  
  - Experience working in **remote, fast-paced, iterative development **environments where shipping quickly is valued
  
  If you’re passionate about AI, love building tools that empower others, and thrive in a fast-moving, experimental environment, we’d love to hear from you! 🚀
  
  **Bonus Points:**
  
  - **Research curiosity with product pragmatism:** You read papers for breakfast but also know when "good enough now" beats "perfect later"
  
  - **Bias toward action:** You don't just catalog interesting papers—you prototype them
  
  - **Strong communication skills:** Ability to translate complex research concepts into clear recommendations for engineers and product teams
  
  - **Collaborative experimentation mindset:** You involve others in your discoveries and help the team learn alongside you
  
  - **Comfort with ambiguity:** The role evolves as the field evolves; you thrive in this uncertainty
