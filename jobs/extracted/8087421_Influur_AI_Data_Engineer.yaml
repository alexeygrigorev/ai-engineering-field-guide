  **About Influur**
  
  **
  
  We're building the world's first viral agent. An AI purpose built for influencer marketing.
  
  Not a tool. Not a platform. An autonomous agent** that goes from "I need this campaign to break" to "50 influencers live next week" with minimal human intervention.
  
  **
  
  Why this matters: **We have 3 years of proprietary data on what makes influencer content go viral. Warner, Sony, and Universal trust us to break their biggest artists. We're backed by the biggest names in entertainment including Sofia Vergara, Karol G, Tommy Mottola, and Tier 1 VCs like Point72 Ventures. We're not building for hypothetical use cases. We're shipping production AI that drives millions in revenue today.
  
  **
  
  Why we'll win: **We have what no one else has: **both the data and the distribution.** We have proprietary data on thousands of influencers and what makes content go viral, plus direct relationships with the influencers themselves. In the AI era, having both is the moat. Everyone else has one or the other. We have both.
  
  **
  
  Why now: **AGI agents will replace middle level work by 2027. We have a 12 to 18 month window before the market floods with agents. We're building the category defining social media viral agent **right now**.
  
  **
  
  What we're looking for: **Elite builders who want full ownership, not a narrow role. This is not a “data engineer” job in the traditional sense. It’s an opportunity to own the full lifecycle: from raw video ingestion to the decisions made by autonomous AI agents in production. We offer meaningful equity to people who want to define the future of agentic AI and own a real piece of it. 
  
  **Your Skillset**
  
  - Expert-level Python engineering with clean, modular, reusable code.
  
  - Experience building scalable data pipelines for unstructured data (video, audio, multimodal).
  
  - Strong understanding of video/sound processing (codecs, frame extraction, batch & streaming workflows).
  
  - Hands-on experience building AI agents: memory, planning, tool use, and execution loops.
  
  - Ability to design systems that go from raw data → insight → autonomous action.
  
  - Experience with embeddings, multimodal models, and LLM-powered workflows.
  
  - Strong grasp of performance, scalability, and reliability in data-heavy systems.
  
  - Comfortable owning architecture decisions end-to-end, from ingestion to production agents.
  
  - Familiarity with cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP) and scalable compute setups.
  
  **You’re the Type Who**
  
  - Is a full-stack AI generalist: you don’t believe “that’s someone else’s job”.
  
  - Thrives in ambiguity and sees lack of structure as an opportunity to define standards.
  
  - Ships fast and values real-world impact over academic perfection.
  
  - Is obsessed with turning data into leverage through automation and agents.
  
  - Wants to build systems that actually run the business, not just dashboards or models.
  
  - Bonus: Expertise in working with social media data
  
  **What We Offer**
  
  • Competitive equity in a venture-backed company shaping the future of music influencer marketing.
  
  • A seat at the table as we update and develop our AI Agent to power smarter matchmaking and campaign automation.
  
  • Access to elite tools, AI copilots, and a team that builds daily at top speed.
  
  • The opportunity to shape the foundation of Influur’s AI systems that empower creators and brands globally.
