  Backend Engineer, AIAbout the Role
  
  A1 is building a proactive AI system that carries work
  forward across conversations, tools, and time.
  
  You will build the systems that power every AI interaction
  users experience. Your work will sit at the intersection of
  models, orchestration, APIs, and product behavior - where
  correctness, latency, and reliability actually matter.
  
  Focus
  
  - Build and operate backend systems that serve AI-powered
    features in production.
  - Design inference pipelines, orchestration layers, and
    service boundaries around models.
  - Own production concerns: monitoring, logging, alerting, and
    incident response.
  - Optimize latency and throughput across inference, caching,
    batching, and streaming.
  
  Ideal Experiences
  
  - Strong backend engineering fundamentals in production
    environments.
  - Experience running high-throughput, low-latency services.
  - Familiarity with AI inference patterns (LLMs, embeddings,
    multimodal).
  - Comfortable debugging distributed systems under load.
  - Bias toward shipping and learning from production behavior.
  
  Tech Stack
  
  - Python
  - NodeJs
  - Pytorch
  - OpenAI / Anthropic / open-source LLMs
  - SQl & noSQL
  - Kubernetes
  - Docker
  
  How We Work
  
  Our organization is very flat and our team is small, highly
  motivated, and focused on engineering and product
  excellence. All members are expected to be hands-on and to
  contribute directly to the company’s mission.
  
  Interview process
  
  If there appears to be a fit, we'll reach to schedule 3, but
  no more than 4 interviews.
  
  Applications are evaluated by our technical team members.
  Interviews will be conducted via virtual meetings and/or
  onsite.
  
  We value transparency and efficiency, so expect a prompt
  decision. If you've demonstrated the exceptional skills and
  mindset we're looking for, we'll extend an offer to join us.
  This isn't just a job offer; it's an invitation to be part
  of a team that's bringing AI to have practical benefits to
  billions globally.
