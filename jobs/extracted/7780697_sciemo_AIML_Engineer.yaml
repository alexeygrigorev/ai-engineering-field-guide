  **about sciemo**
  
  Sciemo builds AI for consumer goods: technology that helps businesses make faster, smarter, and more human decisions across the entire IBP process. From optimizing promotions to balancing demand and supply, Sciemo's platform transforms messy, siloed data into measurable business impact. Its AI agents assist decision-makers in real-time, turning complexity into clarity. We are headquartered in New York City.
  
  **overview**
  
  We are an industry-leading startup developing AI for consumer brands. Our solutions leverage machine learning, generative AI, agent-based systems, and graph technologies to get our customers to insights in seconds and to business impact in minutes using our products.
  
  We are looking for a Founding Member of Technical Staff to join our team guiding the development and deployment of complex ML systems reporting to Dan Wald, Co-Founder & CAIO.
  
  **role**
  
  As a Founding Member of Technical Staff, you will work in a hybrid capacity as both a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer, you will play a pivotal role in designing, building, and deploying the intelligence behind our AI products. You’ll work across the full spectrum of applied AI—spanning data science, machine learning, and large-scale production engineering. This hybrid role requires both deep expertise in developing innovative models and the engineering discipline to deploy and maintain them in robust, scalable systems.
  
  You’ll collaborate closely with data engineers, product leads, backend engineers, and customer-facing teams to ensure that our AI systems deliver measurable value in real-world environments. As one of the earliest technical hires, you will help define our AI strategy, set technical standards, and establish best practices for applied AI at scale.
