  **💡 **Mission****
  
  The US healthcare system is complex, error-prone, and financially draining. Medical bills and insurance coverage shouldn’t be this hard to navigate. At Granted, we’re building the one solution every American can turn to for help.
  
  Thanks to AI and new regulations, Granted can fight claim denials, correct billing errors, negotiate bills, and make coverage easier to understand—saving people time, money, and stress. Our goal is simple: to be the #1 platform that empowers all Americans to take charge of their healthcare.
  
  **🩺 **About Us****
  
  Founded by a former Oscar Health leader, we’re a seed-stage company with $17M in funding. We’re lucky to be backed by the founders and investors at Hugging Face, Rocket Money, Oscar Health, CaseText, Forerunner Ventures, RRE Ventures, and more. We are well-funded for the next few years.

  ****🔎 About the Role****
  
  The Automations pod turns complex healthcare case work into scalable, agentic workflows — driving automation coverage, lowering cost to serve, and ensuring users get fast, accurate outcomes without needing to navigate the system themselves.
  
  As an engineer on this team, you’ll help build the intelligence layer behind these workflows — designing distributed systems, integrating AI models, and ensuring everything runs reliably at scale.
  
  **🚀 What You’ll Do**
  - 
  
  Design and build scalable systems and APIs that power agentic workflows from case activation through resolution.
  
  - 
  
  Push the frontier of AI-driven engineering, working on prompt orchestration, agent frameworks, and model evaluation loops.
  
  - 
  
  Collaborate closely with Product, Engineering, and domain experts to translate complex healthcare processes into reliable automations.
  
  - 
  
  Architect systems for scale and reliability, ensuring human escalation pathways are transparent and seamless.
  
  - 
  
  Play a key role in shaping the pod’s technical strategy, and mentor others as the team grows.
  
  ****🧪 What You Might Work On****
  - 
  
  Creating and optimizing AI pipelines to identify, categorize, and resolve errors in medical billing and insurance claims.
  
  - 
  
  Building automated agents and backend services that handle complex case flows with minimal human intervention.
  
  - 
  
  Integrating domain-specific healthcare knowledge into models and decision engines to improve accuracy.
  
  - 
  
  Developing tooling and infrastructure to measure and improve AI performance in real-world scenarios.

  ****👩‍💻 We'll be most excited if you****
  - 
  
  Bring 6-10+ years of backend engineering experience, ideally building production systems at scale.
  
  - 
  
  Are deeply curious about AI — from prompt engineering and agent orchestration to model evaluation.
  
  - 
  
  Excel at designing pragmatic solutions to complex technical challenges.
  
  - 
  
  Communicate clearly and collaborate effectively across disciplines.
  
  - 
  
  Thrive in high-autonomy, fast-moving environments.
  
  - 
  
  *(Bonus)* Have experience with healthcare data, product engineering, ML systems, or web crawling.
  
  - 
  
  *(Extra bonus)* Have 10+ years of GPT-5 experience — or, failing that, a good sense of humor.
  
  📢 You don't need to check every single box—if you're passionate, driven, and excited about the impact AI can make on the healthcare system, we'd love to hear from you!
