  About Supernal
  
  At Supernal, we help SMBs hire their first AI employee. Our
  AI teammates are built with intelligent, agentic workflows
  and deployed on our proprietary platform, with orchestration
  powered by N8n. We don’t build tools—we deliver working,
  value-generating AI Employees.
  
  Our AI Platform Engineers, known internally as Masons, are
  the builders behind these systems. Now, we’re looking for a
  Senior Mason to help lead this craft.
  
  The Role
  
  As a Senior AI Platform Engineer, you’ll be on the
  frontlines of our most critical client implementations.
  You’ll design and build intelligent agentic workflows that
  power real business outcomes. But your role goes far beyond
  individual contribution.
  
  You will be a technical leader within the Mason
  team—enforcing and evolving best practices, and codifying
  the Supernal method for building AI Employees. You’ll work
  directly with the Head of Delivery and help shape how
  agentic systems are delivered at scale.
  
  This is a hands-on role. You’re not just reviewing PRs or
  sitting in meetings—you’re in the weeds, building systems,
  solving gnarly edge cases, and showing others how it’s done.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Build advanced AI agent workflows on N8n and Supernal’s
    proprietary platform
  - Lead engineering delivery for our highest-priority customers
  - Own technical architecture decisions for agentic systems,
    including tool usage, RAG design, API orchestration, and
    task decomposition
  - Define, document, and evolve our engineering best practices
  - Review technical work for quality, scalability, and
    maintainability
  - Contribute to internal tooling and system improvements that
    accelerate agent deployment
  - Partner with the Head of Product to help scope and validate
    technical solutions across accounts
  
  You Might Be a Fit If You…
  
  - Have 4+ years of experience as a software engineer,
    automation engineer, or technical systems builder
  - Have deep experience with agentic architectures, workflow
    automation platforms (N8n, Zapier, Make), and APIs
  - Understand prompt engineering, function-calling, retrieval-
    augmented generation (RAG), and LLM orchestration
  - Are passionate about systems thinking and designing
    workflows that can scale
  - Are an elite debugger and systems optimizer—you can reason
    through edge cases, flakey agents, and API chaos
  - Can balance hands-on work with technical leadership
  - Are comfortable in a fast-paced, ambiguous startup
    environment and thrive under autonomy
  - Have a low-ego, high-integrity approach to team
    collaboration
  
  What Success Looks Like
  
  - Supernal’s AI Employees are consistently high-performing,
    robust, and scalable
  - Our technical best practices are living, documented, and
    widely adopted
  - Engineering quality improves even as the team rapidly scales
industries:
  - Artificial Intelligence
  - Financial Services
