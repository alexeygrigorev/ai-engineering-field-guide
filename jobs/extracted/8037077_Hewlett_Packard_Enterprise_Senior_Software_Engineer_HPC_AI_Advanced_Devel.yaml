  data from simulations and HPC systems.
  
  
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  ·       Distributed HPC/AI workflow development,
  experimentation, and testing for enabling interactive
  processing of large-scale telemetry datasets (terabytes to
  petabytes).
  
  ·       Building solutions by composing existing open-source
  solutions and using distributed and parallel programming
  approaches for scaling data and simulation size.
  
  ·       Actively participate in a collaborative, consensus-
  driven design process.
  
  ·       Work in an Agile development environment.
  
  ·       Create documentation, collaborate with users, and

  software engineering.
  
  ·       Proficiency in one or more programming languages
  such as C, C++, or Python.
  
  ·       Exposure to high-performance computing (HPC) or
  scientific computing.
  
  ·       Experience designing, building, or operating
  distributed large-scale systems in production environments.
  
  ·       Experience with software engineering workflows,
  including version control, code reviews, automated testing,
  and CI/CD pipelines.
  
  ·       Proficient in conveying technical concepts clearly
  and effectively through documentation, presentations, and
  design discussions.
  
  ·       Strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

  ·       Experience collaborating with scientists or
  engineers on data science, data analytics, simulations, or
  modeling.
  
  ·       Experience with distributed-memory parallel
  programming on supercomputers or large-scale clusters.
  
  ·       Background in digital twin software development,
  including integration with visualization tools and AI/ML
  workflows.
  
  ·       Experience working on containerization &
  orchestration technologies such as Docker, Podman,
  Apptainer, Slurm and Kubernetes.
  
  ·       Experience developing or supporting workflows for
  HPC system design and operation.
  
  ·       Experience developing AI surrogates especially in
  the context of detecting real-time HPC system errors.
  
  ·       Experience incorporating and fine-tuning LLMs to
  provide a chat interface for any analysis or development
  environment.
  
  ·       Knowledge of parallel and discrete event simulation,
  especially with SST (https://sst-simulator.org/).
  
  ·       Familiarity with checkpointing techniques
  (efficiency, size optimization, recovery, persistence).
  
  ·       Familiarity with performance debugging and
  optimization at scale.
  
  ·       Familiarity with Pandas, NumPy, Dask, Spark or other
  data science technologies
