description: |
  Lookout, Inc. is the endpoint to cloud security company
  purpose-built for the intersection of enterprise and
  personal data. We safeguard data across devices, apps,
  networks and clouds through our unified, cloud-native
  security platform — a solution that's as fluid and flexible
  as the modern digital world. By giving organizations and
  individuals greater control over their data, we enable them
  to unleash its value and thrive. Lookout is trusted by
  enterprises of all sizes, government agencies and millions
  of consumers to protect sensitive data, enabling them to
  live, work and connect — freely and safely. To learn more
  about the Lookout Cloud Security Platform, visit
  www.lookout.com and follow Lookout on our blog, LinkedIn and
  Twitter.
  
  As part of Lookout's R&D organization, you will have a
  unique opportunity to spearhead the internal Agentic AI
  revolution. While our core engineering teams focus on
  product capabilities, you will be the primary architect
  responsible for operationalizing AI across the rest of the
  business. You will work directly with high-impact
  functions—Sales, Marketing, Finance, HR, Legal, and
  Recruiting—to design and build autonomous agents that
  fundamentally change how Lookout operates.
  
  To tackle these challenges, you must be part builder, part
  business analyst, and part evangelist. You need to be open-
  minded enough to experiment with emerging tools (like Gemini
  Enterprise and N8N) and persistent enough to solve complex
  integration puzzles across a diverse SaaS ecosystem. If you
  enjoy bridging the gap between cutting-edge LLM technology
  and real-world business strategy, and want to see your work
  immediately accelerate an entire organization, come check us
  out.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Design, Build and Maintain Agentic Workflows: Responsible
    for architecting and deploying autonomous AI agents using
    low-code/no-code orchestration platforms (e.g., N8N) and
    enterprise LLMs (e.g., Gemini Enterprise).
  - Translate Business Needs to AI Logic: Act as the bridge
    between non-technical stakeholders and AI capabilities.
    You will dissect requests from departments like Finance or
    Legal, understand the "why," and re-engineer their
    processes to be compatible with how LLMs and agents
    actually work.
  - Systems Integration & Orchestration: Figure out how to make
    the AI "talk" to our business stack. You will handle the
    trial-and-error work of integrating agents with
    Salesforce, NetSuite, Workday, Marketo, Vena, and other
    enterprise platforms via APIs and webhooks.
  - Data Strategy for Agents: Determine how to extract, clean,
    and contextually feed data from siloed systems into AI
    models to ensure accurate, hallucination-free outputs.
  - Influence Internal AI Strategy: Move beyond simple
    "chatbots" by identifying high-value use cases for multi-
    step agentic automation that stakeholders haven't even
    thought of yet.
  - Governance & Maintenance: Own the lifecycle of internal
    agents, ensuring they remain secure, cost-effective, and
    functional as underlying APIs and business rules evolve.
  
  Requirements:
  
  - Proven experience building AI Agents: Hands-on experience
    with orchestration tools (N8N, LangChain, Flowise, or
    similar) and direct usage of LLM APIs (Gemini, OpenAI,
    Anthropic).
  - Strong Scripting/Technical Skills: While this is a low-code
    friendly role, you must be proficient in Python or
    JavaScript to write custom logic, handle complex API
    authentication, and transform data payloads.
  - Business Systems Fluency: Demonstrated ability to quickly
    learn the data structures and logic of complex enterprise
    SaaS platforms (CRM, ERP, HRIS). You don’t need to be an
    expert in NetSuite today, but you must know how to read
    API documentation and figure it out fast.
  - Process Engineering Mindset: Experience mapping business
    workflows and spotting inefficiencies. You need the
    ability to say "No" to automating a bad process, and
    instead redesign it for an AI-first approach.
  - Resilience in Debugging: A high tolerance for the "trial and
    error" nature of agent development—debugging hallucinating
    models, fixing broken API connectors, and handling
    unstructured data.
  - Communication Skills: The ability to explain prompt
    engineering and context windows to a VP of Sales or a
    General Counsel in plain English.
  - 3+ years of technical experience: Ideally a mix of software
    engineering, technical product management, or business
    systems analysis.
  
  Nice to have:
  
  - Experience specifically with Google Cloud Platform, Gemini
    and N8N workflow automation.
  - Familiarity with enterprise automation platforms
  - Background in cybersecurity or experience working within a
    security-conscious environment (handling PII/sensitive
    internal data).
  - Experience with Vector Databases and RAG (Retrieval-
    Augmented Generation) patterns for searching internal
    documentation.
