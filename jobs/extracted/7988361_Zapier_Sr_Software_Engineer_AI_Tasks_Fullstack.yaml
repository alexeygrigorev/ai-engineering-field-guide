  AI at Zapier
  
  At Zapier, we build and use automation every day to make
  work more efficient, creative, and human. So if you’re using
  AI tools while applying here - that’s great! We just ask
  that you use them responsibly and transparently.
  
  Check out our guidance on How to Collaborate with AI During
  Zapier’s Hiring Process, including how to use AI tools like
  ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or others during our hiring process
  - and when not to.
  
  Hi there!
  
  Join Zapier’s new AI Tasks team, where you’ll own the core
  AI surfaces that make our customers’ workflows
  smarter—shipping and scaling products like AI by Zapier and
  Human in the Loop that thousands rely on to extract,
  classify, summarize, and safely approve actions in
  production automations. You’ll partner across our AI
  Orchestration portfolio (Agents, Chatbots, Copilot, and
  platform capabilities) to design elegant, reliable AI
  execution patterns at scale—reducing friction, raising
  quality, and turning complex AI into approachable building
  blocks for real businesses.
  
  We’re hiring Senior Full Stack Engineers (both frontend and
  backend leaning) to help invest in taking these surface
  areas to the next level. You’ll collaborate closely with AI
  experts, product managers, designers, and platform engineers
  to bring LLM-native workflows to life — with users and
  usability always at the center.
  
  If you’re excited about building real-world applications of
  AI (not just demos), working across the stack, and shaping
  the future of autonomous agents in automation — we’d love to
  hear from you.
  
  Zapier Agents is a new and fast-moving product at the
  intersection of AI, automation, and product-led growth. In
  this role, you’ll:
  
  - Design and build features that allow users to delegate tasks
    and orchestrate workflows using natural language
  - Collaborate with our platform team that manages agent
    memory, reasoning, execution, and system integrations
  - Build and refine user-facing features and interfaces for
    initiating, monitoring, and guiding agent behavior
  - Collaborate with AI and platform teams to connect Zapier
    Agents with core orchestration infrastructure
  - Own projects end-to-end — from scoping and architecture to
    implementation, testing, and support
  - Improve developer experience, observability, and deployment
    pipelines as the product matures
  
  In this role, you’ll:
  
  - Design and build features that allow users to delegate tasks
    and orchestrate workflows using natural language
  - Contribute to backend systems that manage agent memory,
    reasoning, execution, and system integrations
  - Build and refine user-facing features and interfaces for
    initiating, monitoring, and guiding agent behavior
  - Collaborate with AI and platform teams to connect Zapier
    Agents with core orchestration infrastructure
  - Own projects end-to-end — from scoping and architecture to
    implementation, testing, and support
  - Improve developer experience, observability, and deployment
    pipelines as the product matures

  High Visibility, High Impact
  
  If you thrive on building complex systems that are easy to
  use and hard to break, this zone is for you:
  
  - Work on foundational systems used by millions
  - Help users build smarter, more powerful automations
  - Contribute to new AI-native experiences
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams across Product,
    Design, and Support
  - Join a high-ownership environment with clear user impact and
    fast iteration
  
  About You
  
  We’re looking for experienced engineers who bring:
  
  - For backend-leaning Full Stack roles: Strong backend
    experience with TypeScript/Node.js building reliable,
    scalable, and observable services. Familiarity with
    Python/Django is a nice-to-have.
  - For frontend-leaning Full Stack roles: Advanced experience
    with React (and ideally frameworks like Next.js); you’re
    confident working across the stack and delivering cohesive
    user experiences
  - Experience architecting, building, debugging and operating
    distributed systems at scale is a benefit to candidates,
    but not essential.
  - Familiarity with AWS primitives, including S3, SQS, Lambda,
    RDS, etc.
  - Familiarity with relational databases like PostgreSQL or
    MySQL, and the ability to model, query, and optimize data
    effectively
  - Experience designing and consuming RESTful APIs, building
    event-driven systems, and working with data integrations
    across services
  - Proven ability to lead complex technical projects—owning
    design decisions, balancing tradeoffs, and guiding
    implementation across multiple contributors
  - You proactively coach and support teammates, foster growth
    through mentorship, and contribute to a culture of
    feedback and continuous improvement
  - You navigate ambiguity with confidence—able to clarify
    priorities, align stakeholders, and drive toward
    meaningful outcomes even when goals shift
  - You’ve used AI tooling for work or personal use. You explore
    new tools, workflows, and ideas to make things more
    efficient, and are eager to deepen your understanding of
    AI and use it regularly.

  experiences make us better, which is why we have a non-
  standard application process designed to promote inclusion
  and equity. We're looking for the best fit for each of our
  roles, regardless of the type of companies in your
  background, so we encourage you to apply even if your skills
  and experiences don’t exactly match the job description. All
  we ask is that you answer a few in-depth questions in our
  application that would typically be asked at the start of an
  interview process. This helps speed things up by letting us
  get to know you and your skillset a bit better right out of
  the gate. Please be sure to answer each question; the resume
  and CV fields are optional.

  you receive an offer, you will need to include your most
  recent educational experience as part of our background
  check process.
  
  After you apply, you are going to hear back from us—even if
  we don’t see an immediate fit with our team. In fact,
  throughout the process, we strive to never go more than
  seven days without letting you know the status of your
  application. We know we’ll make mistakes from time to time,
  so if you ever have questions about where you stand or about
  the process, just ask your recruiter!
