  About the Role
  
  A1 is building a proactive AI system that users rely on
  daily across conversations, tools, and workflows.
  
  You will build and maintain production Android applications
  where AI is a core part of the user experience. This role
  focuses on performance, reliability, and thoughtful UX for
  AI-heavy interactions, not thin-client glue code.
  
  Focus
  
  - Build and maintain production Android apps using Kotlin.
  - Integrate AI-powered features (chat, vision, voice,
    recommendations) via backend APIs.
  - Design UX patterns for AI interactions, including streaming
    responses, retries, and partial results.
  - Optimize performance, memory usage, and responsiveness for
    AI-heavy flows.
  - Implement analytics, logging, and feedback capture to
    support AI evaluation and iteration.
  - Collaborate closely with backend and ML engineers on API
    contracts and system behavior.
  - Ensure app stability, security, and scalability in
    production environments.
  
  Ideal Experiences
  
  - 3+ years of Android development experience using Kotlin.
  - Hands-on experience integrating AI features (e.g. LLM,
    vision, speech APIs).
  - Strong understanding of asynchronous programming
    (Coroutines, Flow).
  - Familiarity with REST or gRPC APIs and structured data
    formats.
  - Strong debugging and performance profiling skills.
  - Comfort building in environments with latency, partial
    failure, and non-deterministic behavior.
  - Experience with MLKit or light on-device inference.
  - Published production apps on the Google Play Store.
  
  Tech Stack
  
  - Kotlin / Java
  - SQL / noSQL
  - TensorFlow Lite (on-device inference)
  
  How We Work
  
  Our organization is very flat and our team is small, highly
  motivated, and focused on engineering and product
  excellence. All members are expected to be hands-on and to
  contribute directly to the company’s mission.
  
  Interview process
  
  If there appears to be a fit, we'll reach to schedule 3, but
  no more than 4 interviews.
  
  Applications are evaluated by our technical team members.
  Interviews will be conducted via virtual meetings and/or
  onsite.
  
  We value transparency and efficiency, so expect a prompt
  decision. If you've demonstrated the exceptional skills and
  mindset we're looking for, we'll extend an offer to join us.
  This isn't just a job offer; it's an invitation to be part
  of a team that's bringing AI to have practical benefits to
  billions globally.
