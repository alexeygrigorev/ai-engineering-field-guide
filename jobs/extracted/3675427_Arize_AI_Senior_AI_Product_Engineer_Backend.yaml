  About Arize
  
  AI is rapidly transforming the world. As generative AI
  reshapes industries, teams need powerful ways to monitor,
  troubleshoot, and optimize their AI systems. That’s where we
  come in. Arize AI is the leading AI & Agent Engineering
  observability and evaluation platform, empowering AI
  engineers to ship high-performing, reliable agents and
  applications. From first prototype to production scale,
  Arize AX unifies build, test, and run in a single
  workspace—so teams can ship faster with confidence.
  
  We’re a Series C company backed by top-tier investors, with
  over $135M in funding and a rapidly growing customer base of
  150+ leading enterprises and Fortune 500 companies.
  Customers like Booking.com, Uber, Siemens, and PepsiCo
  leverage Arize to deliver AI that works.
  
  The Opportunity
  
  Our Backend Engineering team builds all of the highly
  scalable distributed services that power Arize’s ML
  observability platform. While Go is our primary language for
  these distributed systems, the team also maintains services
  and tools written in Python, Java, and TypeScript. The
  expectation and scope of every individual on this team is
  high, whether it’s finding the most efficient way to compute
  model evaluation metrics across billions of data points,
  designing the next generation of our OLAP database
  architecture, or researching and implementing the latest
  dimensionality reduction techniques – you will never lack a
  technical challenge.
  
  You will be a part of the core team that drives product
  innovation at Arize. You will be challenged with
  understanding how some of the most impactful engineering
  teams are developing AI and LLM-powered applications, and
  how to build the right tools to enable them to do their best
  work. Our product solutions range from clean APIs that
  magically instrument applications, interactive playgrounds
  for prompt engineering and agent development, or scaling up
  real-time evaluation infrastructure to handle millions of
  annotations per second.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Write maintainable, scalable, and performant backend code
    primarily in Go, Java, and Python, with opportunities to
    work in TypeScript.
  - Build high-volume and highly available analytics systems.
  - Design and build APIs specific to our customers’ Machine
    Learning and LLM workflows.
  - Prototype, optimize, and maintain scalable backend services
    that power the Arize core platform.
  - Extend, and contribute back to, open source OLAP databases
    and distributed message queue frameworks.
  - Develop and integrate collection tools for robust monitoring
    of ML and LLM pipelines.
  - Research and implement cutting-edge visualization &
    dimensionality reduction algorithms in a distributed
    environment.
  - Collaborate with our product, design, and directly with
    customer engineering teams to enhance and expand our
    product offerings.
  - Contribute to the build our own in-house AI Agents
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - 5+ years of experience working with high-performance backend
    systems.
  - Strong experience writing Go, Python, TypeScript/Node, Java,
    or similar server programming languages.
  - Enthusiasm and interest in the AI and LLM ecosystem, with a
    desire to learn and stay updated on emerging technologies.
  - Previous work building and operating highly complex SaaS
    platforms/systems.
  - Knowledge of working with public clouds & container
    orchestration - AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, etc.
  
  Bonus Points, But Not Required
  
  - Experience with distributed stream processing - Kafka,
    Gazette, or similar.
  - Experience with OLAP systems.
  - Familiarity with system observability tooling like
    Prometheus.
  - Working knowledge of Machine Learning and/or Data Science.
  - First-hand experience working with large language models
    (LLMs) or developing AI products.
  
  The estimated annual salary for this role is between
  $125,000 - $225,000, plus a competitive equity package.
  Actual compensation is determined based on a variety of job-
  related factors that may include transferable work
  experience, skill sets, and qualifications. Total
  compensation also includes a comprehensive benefits package,
  including medical, dental, vision, a 401(k) plan, unlimited
  paid time off, a generous parental leave plan, and
  additional support for mental health and wellness.
  
  While we are a remote-first company, we have opened offices
  in New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area, as an
  option for those in those cities who wish to work in-person.
  For all other employees, there is a WFH monthly stipend to
  pay for co-working spaces.
