  ****The Role****
  
  As an Engineer in our newly established and rapidly growing AI team, you will build and operationalize high-value AI workflows across business use-cases, product integrations, and internal data intelligence (Data Lake). You will help extend our AI platform and shared services by delivering production-grade capabilities on our Azure infrastructure, integrating LLM functionality into reliable, secure, and observable systems, including scoped agent workflows that can be shipped, monitored, and iterated quickly.
  
  Success in this position requires strong engineering fundamentals, an operational mindset, and the ability to work autonomously while partnering effectively with technical and non-technical stakeholders across global teams.
  ****Key Responsibilities****
  - Build end-to-end workflow implementations from requirements to production: APIs, services, orchestration, and integrations
  
  - Integrate AI capabilities into products and internal tools (LLM calls, tool/function calling, guardrails, evals, response structuring)
  
  - Design and implement scoped agent workflows with clear boundaries, tools, permissions, fallbacks, and measurable outcomes
  
  - Collaborate with vendors to deliver ROI-focused use-cases: define interfaces, validate delivery quality, and productionize outputs
  
  - Establish strong observability: structured logging, tracing, metrics, dashboards, alerting, and runbooks
  
  - Partner with data teams on Data Lake access patterns, workflows, metadata, governance, and reliability
  ****Essential Skills & Experience****
  - 5-10 years professional software engineering experience; strong Python (services, APIs, testing)
  
  - Cloud infrastructure experience (Azure preferred), operating production systems; cloud security fluency (identity, RBAC, secrets management, logging/auditing)
  
  - CI/CD experience (Git-based pipelines, automated tests, deployment gates, rollback awareness)
  
  - Strong testing, documentation, and operational discipline
  **** ****Preferred skills & Experience  ****
  - Data engineering fundamentals (schemas, pipelines, quality checks) within governed environments
  
  - Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/Terraform), containerization (Docker), and API management patterns
  
  - Agentic patterns (tool use, orchestration, state management) and practical guardrails
  
  - Microsoft Graph and/or strong enterprise identity/API permissioning patterns
