  role
  
  About our Client
  
  Our client is on a mission to revolutionize enterprise
  software efficiency — not by iterating on existing systems
  but by transcending them with seamless, intelligent AI
  workforce automation. Our platform replaces fragmented
  systems with a unified ecosystem of AI Agents and AI Teams
  that execute tasks cross-functionally, dramatically cutting
  tech and operational waste (by 30–40% within just 4–12
  weeks)
  
  Backed by luminaries across AI and enterprise, we’re
  building the future of work: autonomous, scalable, and
  profoundly impactful.
  
  Role Overview
  
  We’re looking for a Founding AI Engineer—a full-stack
  Python-savvy AI practitioner who thrives building next-gen
  AI applications. You'll work at the crossroads of
  engineering, product, and vision, shaping how our platform
  empowers businesses with AI that acts, thinks, and executes.
  
  In this role, you will:
  
  - Architect and build AI Agent and multi-agent systems using
    LLMs and Python-based frameworks.
  - Develop full-stack features—from model orchestration to
    production deployment.
  - Own and shape technical direction alongside leadership, with
    tremendous scope and autonomy.
  - Ensure that our platform delivers instant ROI and
    transformative efficiency to enterprises.
  
  What You Bring
  
  Must-Have
  
  - Solid engineering experience (2–5+ years) with strengths in
    Python and full-stack development.
  - Hands-on experience building AI agents, multi-agent systems,
    or LLM-powered workflows.
  - Familiarity with deployment tooling, orchestration, model
    integration, or RAG-style pipelines.
  - Excitement for solving tough problems in fast-paced, early-
    stage environments.
  
  Nice-to-Have
  
  - Experience with AI marketplaces, “AI App Stores,” or
    generative agent frameworks.
  - Previous exposure to agent orchestration, prompt
    engineering, or evaluation frameworks.
  - Startup background, ideally with roles that combined
    engineering and product leadership.
  
  Why Join?
  
  - Significant Equity (~4%) in an early-stage startup — you're
    joining early, owning impact.
  - Radical Mission — we're not just optimizing; we're
    redefining enterprise software completely.
  - Autonomy + Influence — you'll shape architecture, product,
    and deployment strategy.
  - Remote-friendly in Europe, with a passionate, mission-
    aligned leadership team.
