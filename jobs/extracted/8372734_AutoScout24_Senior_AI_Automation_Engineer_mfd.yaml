  A career driven by you. Join AutoScout24 Group and
  experience life in the fast lane. We’re not just leading the
  market; we’re creating it. We’re constantly innovating,
  evolving and transforming things for our customers. We’re
  driven, ambitious and determined to do our best work,
  together. For a career that doesn’t stand still, where you
  can put your ideas in the driving seat and change the way
  the world moves, join our international community.
  
  The Senior AI Automation Engineer, Business Systems designs,
  builds, and operates GenAI-powered automations and agents
  for internal business workflows. The role delivers hands-on
  at the application and integration layer, partnering closely
  with business owners, the AI Enablement Team / Business
  Technology Services Team, and platform/data teams to ship
  reliable solutions with measurable impact.
  
  What you’ll do:
  
  - Design, build, and ship GenAI automations and agents into
    internal business workflows
  - Write and maintain application code, orchestration logic,
    and integration components
  - Integrate with business systems and tools (e.g., CRM, ERP,
    HCM, contact center, collaboration tools) via APIs,
    events, and workflows
  - Leverage shared data/platform capabilities (data access
    patterns, connectors, reliability practices) rather than
    rebuilding foundations
  - Define and apply quality checks for agent behavior; iterate
    based on usage, feedback, and failure modes
  - Engineer for production: reliability, security,
    observability, and cost awareness
  - Partner with stakeholders to clarify requirements, validate
    outputs, and support rollout into operations
  - Capture reusable patterns, templates, and technical
    blueprints to speed up future delivery
  
  What you’ll bring:
  
  - 5+ years of professional experience in software engineering,
    automation engineering, or systems integration
  - Experience integrating enterprise systems using APIs,
    events, and workflow tooling
  - Practical GenAI implementation experience (LLM APIs,
    tool/function calling; retrieval patterns where needed)
  - Solid engineering fundamentals: testing, debugging, code
    quality, and operational readiness
  - Strong problem-solving and ability to move from ambiguity to
    implementation with disciplined scoping
  - Effective communication across technical and non-technical
    stakeholders
  
  Nice to have
  
  - Experience with agent frameworks, evaluation/monitoring
    approaches, or prompt/application architecture
  - Familiarity with identity/access patterns and secure
    enterprise integrations
  - Experience with CRM/ERP/HCM/contact center ecosystems or
    internal tooling environments

  With over 50 nationalities represented, we’re proud to
  welcome people of all backgrounds to our growing community,
  and we’re always finding new ways to help people feel
  welcomed and included. Here, you’ll have the tools, training
  and support you need to work in a way that suits you, learn
  new skills and reach your potential.

  future, apply now.
