  Hey! We're team Granola 👋
  
  If you haven't already, you should check out what we're
  building, and why you should work here.
  
  We are looking for a self-starting engineer, passionate
  about applying the latest advancements in LLMs to create
  user-centric products.
  
  In this role, you will stay on top of the latest LLM trends,
  build evaluation frameworks for AI features, and apply your
  knowledge with a product-oriented focus. You will be an
  integral part of the founding team, interacting directly
  with users to understand their needs and rapidly developing
  features that deliver significant value. Your work will be
  pivotal in scaling Granola to its next 100x growth
  milestone.
  
  In this role, you will:
  
  - Own the development and application of LLM-based features
    end-to-end
  - Build and maintain evaluation frameworks for prompt
    iteration and semantic retrieval
  - Optimize embeddings and vector stores for performance and
    scalability
  - Interact with users to understand their problems and design
    solutions
  - Stay up-to-date with the latest trends in LLMs and applied
    AI practices
  - Collaborate with a cross-functional team of engineers,
    product managers, designers, and other members to create a
    cutting-edge product
  
  Your background looks something like:
  
  - Engineering experience at tech and product-driven companies
  - Shipping multi-provider LLM-based solutions to production
    (using e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
  - Proficiency with LLM infra platforms (prompt management,
    logging/tracing, evals)
  - Experience designing large-context LLM systems (RAG,
    knowledge graphs, hybrid search, memory)
  - Building features end-to-end with TypeScript, React.js, and
    Node.js
  
  As a person, you…
  
  - Are first and foremost a builder.
  - Are excited to work in-person from our office in London
    (most of the time)
  - Love working in a startup environment (you either have
    experience working in a startup or are really drawn to the
    zero-to-one phase)
  - Want to be at the cutting edge of building world-class
    products on top of language models
  - Are fascinated by LLMs. You love to play with them, figure
    out what makes them tick and get them to do what you want.
    You scour the web and reddit for others doing the same
    (you probably follow @goodside on twitter)
  - Value working with people who are kind, ambitious and
    pragmatic
  
  About the opportunity
  
  We are living in the most exciting time for tool builders
  since Engelbart's demo in 1968. We want to assemble the best
  crew to build this future together, here in London. Our
  compensation philosophy is to pay slightly above market on
  salary and above market on equity.
  
  We do our best work in person, and so our team spends time
  together five days per week in our new, bright, and spacious
  office at Old Street. We are happy to offer relocation
  assistance to candidates who'll be moving to London to join
  us.
  
  Lastly, we think amazing talent comes from all kinds of life
  journeys and experiences. If what is written above speaks to
  you, whether you look like a fit on paper or not, please
  reach out.
