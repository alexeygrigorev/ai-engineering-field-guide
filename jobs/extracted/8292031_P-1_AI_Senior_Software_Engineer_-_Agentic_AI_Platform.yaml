  About P-1 AI:
  
  We are building an engineering AGI. We founded P-1 AI with
  the conviction that the greatest impact of artificial
  intelligence will be on the built world. Our first product
  is Archie, an AI engineer capable of quantitative intuition
  over physical product domains and engineering tool use.
  Archie initially performs at the level of an entry-level
  design engineer but rapidly gets smarter and more capable.
  We aim to put an Archie on every engineering team at every
  industrial company on earth.
  
  Our founding team includes the top minds in deep learning,
  model-based engineering, and industries that are our
  customers. We closed a $23 million seed round led by Radical
  Ventures that includes a number of other AI and industrial
  luminaries (from OpenAI, DeepMind, etc.).
  
  About the role: We’re a small team tackling an ambitious
  problem. At the core of our solution is an intelligent,
  agentic platform that acts as a tireless teammate which can
  perform all of the same actions that human engineers can,
  from developing an intuition about the company’s products
  and the physics at play in their design, to accessing and
  using information systems, to decomposing performance
  requirements and developing them into design solutions.
  Archie must be scalable, responsive, and competent, and must
  also be deployable within the corporate networks of our
  customers so that he can see their most valuable information
  and do his job well.
  
  Our Senior SWE for the Agentic AI Platform will design and
  implement solutions for these challenges, which range from
  classic distributed systems, integration, and security work,
  to robustly implementing advanced intelligence features
  developed by our AI research team. Ownership comes by
  default, but as Archie becomes more sophisticated we also
  have potential growth into technical leadership for specific
  specialty areas.
  
  This role is remote and you can be based anywhere in the US
  or Canada, where you must have existing work authorization.
  You will be expected to travel to our San Mateo office for
  co-working sessions approximately one week out of every six.
  If you are already located in the Bay Area or are interested
  in relocation, you are of course welcome to work out of our
  San Mateo office. Our AI team is based in the San Mateo
  office, so there would be some benefit to you being in-
  office at least part of the time.
  
  Why this role:
  
  This role is where AI meets reality. Every user that works
  with Archie will be using features and capabilities that you
  have built, no matter the industry or context.
  
  What you’ll do:
  
  - Work with our team to understand our Archie capability
    roadmap and decompose capabilities into technical
    development.
  - Turn capability prototypes and PoCs from our AI research
    team into robust, scalable implementations.
  - Diagnose and solve technical problems identified by our team
    or users.
  - Develop and act on automated platform tests, including
    traditional software testing, agentic AI evals, and
    infrastructure.
  - Improve Archie’s scalability and robustness through system
    architecture design and implementation.
  
  Who you are:
  
  - You’ve consistently taken technical ownership of production-
    grade software.
  - You’re experienced with application development in Python.
  - You’ve built and implemented data models and database
    interactions.
  - You develop an obsession with understanding your users’
    goals and incorporating this knowledge into your
    solutions.
  - Take pride in developing quality code and practices.
  - Are aggressively seeking ways to use AI better in your own
    workflows.
  
  Our values:
  
  Mission obsession & urgency: We are obsessed with building
  engineering AGI as quickly as possible. We also recognize
  that as a startup, speed is our most precious competitive
  advantage. We are constantly asking ourselves what we can do
  to go faster. We make tradeoffs and sacrifices (personally
  and in the workplace) in exchange for speed.
  
  Intellectual excellence & curiosity: We ask “what if?” and
  experiment liberally. We always look for better ways of
  doing something. We read voraciously. We challenge each
  other to be better. We surround ourselves with A players and
  we actively and unapologetically reject B players (and even
  B+ players⸺because they tend to surround themselves with C
  players).
  
  Shipping discipline: We treat production with respect. We
  test and demo our product constantly. We listen attentively
  to our customers, users, and stakeholders, and we respect
  our commitments to them. We also respect our commitments to
  each other and will go the extra mile (or ten or one
  hundred) to honor them.
  
  Ownership: We all have significant ownership stakes in the
  company and operate in founder mode. We believe in
  hierarchical requirements but not in hierarchical
  information flows. If we see that something is broken or can
  be done better, we flag it and we fix it. We encourage each
  other to play with and fix anything and everything... but
  there’s a clear owner for everything.
  
  Interview process:
  
  - Initial screening call (30 mins)
  
  - Biographical/behavioural interview (45 mins)
  - Technical interview (60 mins)
  - CEO interview (30 mins)
  
  Compensation:
  
  Salary: $200k - $250k.
  
  This role includes a significant equity component. We are an
  early-stage startup, so we favor equity over cash in our
  current compensation philosophy. This role is best suited
  for candidates who value long-term ownership and impact over
  short-term cash optimization. Our benefits include
  healthcare, dental, and vision insurance, 401k with employer
  matching, unlimited PTO.
