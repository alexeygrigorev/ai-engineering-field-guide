  **Snapshot**
  
  Work with research scientists and engineers to advance the capabilities of CodeMender, an AI agent for code security. Together, you will apply ML and advanced program analysis techniques to make software more secure.
  **About Us**
  
  Artificial Intelligence could be one of humanity’s most useful inventions. At DeepMind, we’re a team of scientists, engineers, machine learning experts and more, working together to advance the state of the art in artificial intelligence. We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.
  **The Role**
  
  AI’s cyberattack capability is increasing rapidly; recently, there has been a surge in the number of zero-day exploits found by AI in well-tested software. As we achieve more breakthroughs in AI-powered vulnerability discovery, it will become increasingly difficult for humans alone to keep up. We recently announced CodeMender, an AI agent for Code Security that helps solve this problem by taking a comprehensive approach to code security that’s both reactive, instantly patching new vulnerabilities, and proactive, rewriting and securing existing code and eliminating entire classes of vulnerabilities in the process. 
  
  As a research scientist in the CodeMender team, you will research new approaches to leveraging AI for code security, build prototypes and demos, train new models, work with partner and client teams, and most importantly, land transformative impact for GDM and software security more broadly.
  
  The preferred locations are Mountain View, San Francisco, or New York.
  
  **Key responsibilities:**
  
  - Developing strategies and solutions to advance the agent's abilities to solve code security challenges.
  
  - Integrating novel agentic techniques into research prototypes.
  
  - Training new models using fine tuning or reinforcement learning techniques.
  
  - Building evaluation pipelines, benchmarks, and leaderboards.
  
  - Working with product teams to gather research and product requirements.
  
  - Consulting on the deployment of research-based solutions to products.
  ****About You****
  
  We seek out individuals who thrive in ambiguity and who are willing to help out with whatever moves prototypes forward. We regularly need to invent novel solutions to problems, and at times change course if our ideas don’t work out, so flexibility and adaptability to work is a must.
  
  **In order to set you up for success as a Research Scientist or Research Engineer at DeepMind,  we look for the following skills and experience:**
  
  - Extensive experience with developing ML techniques to reasoning and code generation problems
  
  - MSc or PhD/DPhil degree in computer science or a related field.
  
  - Significant success with project(s) building AI tools, either as research publications at top conferences, as an artifact developed at a company, or as open source artifact(s).
  
  - Large contribution to the code and (co-)leading the development in the project(s) above (which can be a research prototype).
  
  - Proven experience of prominent ML frameworks is highly desirable.
  
  - Experience in ML/AI for Code is helpful.
  
  - Independent, self-starter attitude.
  
  - Passion for the mission above.
  
  The US base salary range for this full-time position is between $141,000 - $291,000 + bonus + equity + benefits. Your recruiter can share more about the specific salary range for your targeted location during the hiring process.
  
  At Google DeepMind, we value diversity of experience, knowledge, backgrounds and perspectives and harness these qualities to create extraordinary impact. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of sex, race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, or related condition (including breastfeeding) or any other basis as protected by applicable law. If you have a disability or additional need that requires accommodation, please do not hesitate to let us know.
