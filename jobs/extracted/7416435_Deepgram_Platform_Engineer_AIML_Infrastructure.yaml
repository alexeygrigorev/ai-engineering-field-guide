  Company Overview
  
  Deepgram is the leading platform underpinning the emerging
  trillion-dollar Voice AI economy, providing real-time APIs
  for speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and building
  production-grade voice agents at scale. More than 200,000
  developers and 1,300+ organizations build voice offerings
  that are ‘Powered by Deepgram’, including Twilio,
  Cloudflare, Sierra, Decagon, Vapi, Daily, Cresta, Granola,
  and Jack in the Box. Deepgram’s voice-native foundation
  models are accessed through cloud APIs or as self-hosted and
  on-premises software, with unmatched accuracy, low latency,
  and cost efficiency. Backed by a recent Series C led by
  leading global investors and strategic partners, Deepgram
  has processed over 50,000 years of audio and transcribed
  more than 1 trillion words. There is no organization in the
  world that understands voice better than Deepgram.
  
  Company Operating Rhythm
  
  At Deepgram, we expect an AI-first mindset—AI use and
  comfort aren’t optional, they’re core to how we operate,
  innovate, and measure performance.
  
  Every team member who works at Deepgram is expected to
  actively use and experiment with advanced AI tools, and even
  build your own into your everyday work. We measure how
  effectively AI is applied to deliver results, and
  consistent, creative use of the latest AI capabilities is
  key to success here. Candidates should be comfortable
  adopting new models and modes quickly, integrating AI into
  their workflows, and continuously pushing the boundaries of
  what these technologies can do.
  
  Additionally, we move at the pace of AI. Change is rapid,
  and you can expect your day-to-day work to evolve just as
  quickly. This may not be the right role if you’re not
  excited to experiment, adapt, think on your feet, and learn
  constantly, or if you’re seeking something highly
  prescriptive with a traditional 9-to-5.
  
  Opportunity:
  
  We're looking for an expert (Senior/Staff-level) Platform
  Engineer to build and operate the hybrid infrastructure
  foundation for our advanced AI/ML research and product
  development. You'll architect, build, and run the platform
  spanning AWS and our bare metal data centers, empowering our
  teams to train and deploy complex models at scale. This role
  is focused on creating a robust, self-service environment
  using Kubernetes, AWS, and Infrastructure-as-Code
  (Terraform), and orchestrating high-demand GPU workloads
  using schedulers like Slurm.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Architect and maintain our core computing platform using
    Kubernetes on AWS and on-premise, providing a stable,
    scalable environment for all applications and services.
  - Develop and manage our entire infrastructure using
    Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) principles with Terraform,
    ensuring our environments are reproducible, versioned, and
    automated.
  - Design, build, and optimize our AI/ML job scheduling and
    orchestration systems, integrating Slurm with our
    Kubernetes clusters to efficiently manage GPU resources.
  - Provision, manage, and maintain our on-premise bare metal
    server infrastructure for high-performance GPU computing.
  - Implement and manage the platform's networking (CNI, service
    mesh) and storage (CSI, S3) solutions to support high-
    throughput, low-latency workloads across hybrid
    environments.
  - Develop a comprehensive observability stack (monitoring,
    logging, tracing) to ensure platform health, and create
    automation for operational tasks, incident response, and
    performance tuning.
  - Collaborate with AI researchers and ML engineers to
    understand their infrastructure needs and build the tools
    and workflows that accelerate their development cycle.
  
  - Automate the life cycle of single-tenant, managed
    deployments
  
  You’ll Love This Role If You
  
  - Are passionate about building platforms that empower
    developers and researchers.
  - Enjoy creating elegant, automated solutions for complex
    infrastructure challenges in both cloud and data center
    environments.
  - Thrive on optimizing hybrid infrastructure for performance,
    cost, and reliability.
  - Are excited to work at the intersection of modern platform
    engineering and cutting-edge AI.
  - Love to treat infrastructure as a product, continuously
    improving the developer experience.
  
  It’s Important To Us That You Have
  
  - 5+ years of experience in Platform Engineering, DevOps, or
    Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).
  - Proven, hands-on experience building and managing production
    infrastructure with Terraform.
  - Expert-level knowledge of Kubernetes architecture and
    operations in a large-scale environment.
  - Experience with high-performance compute (HPC) job
    schedulers, specifically Slurm, for managing GPU-intensive
    AI workloads.
  - Experience managing bare metal infrastructure, including
    server provisioning (e.g., PXE boot, MAAS), configuration,
    and lifecycle management.
  - Strong scripting and automation skills (e.g., Python, Go,
    Bash).
  
  
  
  It Would Be Great if You Had
  
  - Experience with CI/CD systems (e.g., GitLab CI, Jenkins,
    ArgoCD) and building developer tooling.
  - Familiarity with FinOps principles and cloud cost
    optimization strategies.
  - Knowledge of Kubernetes networking (e.g., Calico, Cilium)
    and storage (e.g., Ceph, Rook) solutions.
  - Experience in a multi-region or hybrid cloud environment.
