  Who we are
  
  Helsing is a defence AI company with the mission is to
  protect our liberal democracies. We aim to achieve
  technological leadership, so that open societies can
  continue to make sovereign decisions and control their
  ethical standards. We believe we have a responsibility to be
  thoughtful about the development and deployment of powerful
  technologies like AI and take this responsibility seriously.
  
  We are an ambitious and committed team of software and
  deployment engineers, AI specialists and customer-facing
  programme managers. We are looking for mission-driven people
  to join our European teams – and apply their skills to solve
  the most complex and impactful problems today.
  
  We embrace an open and transparent culture that welcomes
  healthy debates on the use of technology in defence, its
  benefits, and its ethical implications.
  
  The role
  
  At Helsing, we deliver AI-based capabilities and the
  enabling foundation that allow machines to perceive and
  assist human decision-making.
  
  You will have the unique opportunity to shape AI
  capabilities in one of the most challenging sectors, where
  high generalisation capabilities need to be paired with
  hardware constraints and robustness against adversarial
  attacks.
  
  You will be part of a signal processing team, where you will
  build in-house solutions for signal processing problems that
  we face, in the sky or underwater.
  
  The day-to-day
  
  You will develop and extend the state-of-the-art in signal
  processing, applying and deploying the technology in real-
  world scenarios.
  
  You will contribute to projects and will collaborate with
  people across several teams and backgrounds.
  
  You should apply if you
  
  - Hold an MSc in signal processing, machine learning,
    robotics, communication engineering or related field with
    experience in conceptualising, implementing and thoroughly
    evaluating advanced AI-based systems
  - Have excellent communication skills and the ability to
    report and present research findings clearly and
    efficiently both internally and externally
  - Are passionate about keeping up to date with current
    research and enjoy reimplementing / extending the state-
    of-the art in ML/AI
  - Possess solid software engineering skills, writing clean and
    well-structured code in Python and/or languages like Rust,
    Java, or modern C++
  
  Note: We operate at an intersection where women, as well as
  other minority groups, are systematically under-represented.
  We encourage you to apply even if you don’t meet all the
  listed qualifications; ability and impact cannot be
  summarised in a few bullet points.
  
  Nice to have
  
  - A PhD in signal processing, machine learning, robotics,
    communication engineering or related field and have
    authored publications in top-tier journals and conferences
  - Experience with implementing signal processing algorithms,
    time frequency analysis, parameter estimation
  - Experience deploying AI software to production including
    testing, quality assurance, and monitoring
  
  Join Helsing and work with world-leading experts in their
  fields
  
  - Helsing’s work is important. You’ll be directly contributing
    to the protection of democratic countries while balancing
    both ethical and geopolitical concerns
  - The work is unique. We operate in a domain that has highly
    unusual technical requirements and constraints, and where
    robustness, safety, and ethical considerations are vital.
    You will face unique Engineering and AI challenges that
    make a meaningful impact in the world
  - Our work frequently takes us right up to the state of the
    art in technical innovation, be it reinforcement learning,
    distributed systems, generative AI, or deployment
    infrastructure. The defence industry is entering the most
    exciting phase of the technological development curve.
    Advances in our field of world are not incremental:
    Helsing is part of, and often leading, historic leaps
    forward
  - In our domain, success is a matter of order-of-magnitude
    improvements and novel capabilities. This means we take
    bets, aim high, and focus on big opportunities. Despite
    being a relatively young company, Helsing has already been
    selected for multiple significant government contracts
  - We actively encourage healthy, proactive, and diverse debate
    internally about what we do and how we choose to do it.
    Teams and individual engineers are trusted (and
    encouraged) to practise responsible autonomy and critical
    thinking, and to focus on outcomes, not conformity. At
    Helsing you will have a say in how we (and you!) work, the
    opportunity to engage on what does and doesn’t work, and
    to take ownership of aspects of our culture that you care
    deeply about
  
  What we offer
  
  - A dynamic and flexible environment, focusing on outcomes
    rather than output
  - Competitive compensation and stock options
  - Relocation support
  - Social and education allowances
  - Regular team, company events, and all-hands to bring
    together employees as one team across Europe
  - A hands-on onboarding program (affectionately labelled “AI-
    duction”), in which you will be familiarising yourself
    with our tools and ML pipelines used across the company.
    This is your opportunity to learn our tech stack, explore
    the company, and learn how we get things done.
  
  Helsing is an equal opportunities employer. We are committed
  to equal employment opportunity regardless of race,
  religion, sexual orientation, age, marital status,
  disability or gender identity. Please do not submit personal
  data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
  religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership,
  data concerning your health, or data concerning your sexual
  orientation.
