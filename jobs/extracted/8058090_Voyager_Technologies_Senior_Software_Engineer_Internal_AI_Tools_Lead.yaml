  Job Summary:
  
  We are seeking a Senior Software Engineer – Internal AI
  Tools Lead to serve as the technical lead and architect for
  Voyager’s Internal Tools Team. In this role, you will
  design, build, and scale the internal platforms and AI-
  powered automations that power Voyager’s business operations
  end-to-end.
  
  You will own the technical roadmap, work directly with
  functional leaders across the company, and remain a hands-on
  engineer who builds the core systems alongside your team.
  You will mentor your team of AI Automation Engineers, set
  the engineering bar, and be accountable for turning vague
  business pain points into robust, measurable, and automated
  solutions.
  
  This role is ideal for someone who loves building internal
  products, cares deeply about operational excellence, and is
  obsessed with using AI to eliminate manual work—especially
  in complex, high-stakes domains like finance, HR, supply
  chain, and manufacturing.
  
  You will be joining the Internal AI Tools Team, a small,
  high-leverage engineering group focused on building AI-
  powered systems that run Voyager itself. This team designs
  and delivers internal platforms, automations, and copilots
  that turn slow, manual workflows into streamlined,
  integrated systems. We work across the entire
  business—Finance & Accounting, Internal Communications,
  Performance Management, Human Resources, IT &
  Infrastructure, Cyber Security & Systems Assurance, Mergers
  & Acquisitions, R&D and Technology Roadmapping, Strategic
  Planning, Enterprise Risk Management, Quality Assurance,
  Supply Chain & Procurement, Manufacturing & Assembly, and
  Sales / New Business Capture. Our goal is simple: multiply
  the effectiveness of every team at Voyager by replacing
  spreadsheet-driven, email-based processes with secure, AI-
  driven workflows, decision-support tools, and intelligent
  assistants that dramatically reduce cycle times and improve
  execution quality.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Own the technical architecture and roadmap for Voyager’s
    Internal Tools and AI Automation platforms.
  - Partner with leaders across Finance & Accounting, HR, IT,
    Cyber Security, Supply Chain, Manufacturing, and Business
    Development to map manual workflows and translate them
    into scalable software and automation projects.
  - Design and build full-stack internal tools (e.g., workflow
    engines, approval systems, dashboards, copilots) that
    integrate with core enterprise systems (ERP, CRM, HRIS,
    ticketing, document repositories).
  - Build and maintain AI-powered automations and assistants
    (e.g., Slack/Teams bots, workflow agents, RAG systems)
    that streamline recurring tasks such as report generation,
    deal review, policy Q&A, supplier analysis, and
    financial/ops reconciliations.
  - Establish engineering standards for the Internal Tools Team,
    including code quality, testing, observability, and
    security practices appropriate for a defense and aerospace
    organization.
  - Mentor and develop a team of software engineers, providing
    technical guidance, code reviews, and career support while
    staying hands-on as an individual contributor.
  - Leverage agentic workflows and empower your team to use AI
    agents to rapidly and robustly develop internal tools.
  - Instrument and measure impact: define and track KPIs and
    OKRs such as cycle-time reductions, error-rate reductions,
    and automation coverage across key business processes.
  
  Required Qualifications:
  
  - Bachelor’s degree + 6 years, or Master’s degree + 4 years,
    in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related
    technical field; or equivalent practical experience.
  - Proven track record acting as a technical lead or architect
    on multi-stakeholder projects and mentoring junior
    engineers while remaining an active individual
    contributor.
  - 5+ years of professional experience building production
    software systems, internal tools, or SaaS applications
    used by non-technical stakeholders.
  - Strong full-stack engineering skills with experience in
    Python and/or TypeScript, and modern web frameworks (e.g.,
    React, Next.js, FastAPI, Node.js, or similar).
  - Demonstrated experience integrating with enterprise systems
    (e.g., ERP, CRM, HRIS, ticketing, identity, document
    management) via APIs, MCP, and event-driven architectures.
  - Hands-on experience using LLMs and AI services to build
    workflow automations, internal copilots, or intelligent
    assistants (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation, routing,
    or agents).
  - Experience leveraging LLMs for rapid development efforts.
  - Demonstrated “AI-first” workflow in your own development
    practice—using LLMs and tools to accelerate coding,
    documentation, and testing rather than doing all
    boilerplate by hand.
  
  Preferred Qualifications:
  
  - Experience building internal platforms or tooling teams in
    high-growth, operationally complex organizations (e.g.,
    tech, logistics, manufacturing, defense, or aerospace).
  - Familiarity with workflow engines and orchestration systems
    (e.g., LangGraph, n8n, Agent Development Kits).
  - Experience designing systems with strong security and
    compliance postures (e.g. FedRAMP, ITAR/EAR-adjacent
    environments).
  - A visible portfolio of internal tools, open-source projects,
    or side projects that demonstrate your passion for
    building leverage-heavy systems that make other people
    more effective.
  - The strongest candidates will provide links to outstanding
    work (or descriptions when not possible to link) and
    evidence of experience and passion for leveraging agentic
    teams for rapid development.
