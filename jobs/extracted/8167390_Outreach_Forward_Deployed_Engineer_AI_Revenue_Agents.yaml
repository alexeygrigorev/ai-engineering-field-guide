  About the Role** 
  
  Outreach is leading the future of intelligent revenue execution through the power of AI Agents. As a **Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE)**, you'll sit at the intersection of advanced AI technology and real-world customer outcomes—deploying, customizing, and operationalizing AI Revenue Agents across a wide range of GTM workflows. 
  
  **
  
  You’ll play a hands-on role in piloting and implementing AI agents like the AI Revenue Agent**, **Research Agent**, **Conversation Agent**, and **Deal Agent**, ensuring they are seamlessly embedded into customer sales processes. FDEs are not just technical implementers—they’re functional consultants, workflow strategists, and trusted advisors. 
  
  **
  
  Why This Role Matters** 
  
  The future of selling is AI-assisted—and the FDE team is on the front lines of making that future real. You'll help Outreach customers realize transformative value, redefine seller productivity, and drive the next evolution of the modern revenue organization.

  - **Act as a Product & Field Liaison** Provide structured feedback to Product and Engineering based on customer insights, and help communicate roadmap priorities to customers. 
  
  - **Train & Enable Customer Teams** Support customer readiness and change management with training, documentation, and functional support.

  - Strong communication skills for working cross-functionally with Product, Engineering, and GTM teams
