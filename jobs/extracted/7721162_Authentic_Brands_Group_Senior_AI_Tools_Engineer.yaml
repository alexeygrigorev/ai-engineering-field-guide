  - Collaborate with the Prompt Architect to align tools with business logic and prompt capabilities.
  
  - Contribute to internal SDKs and developer documentation for the Authentic Intelligence platform.

  - 4–7 years backend or full-stack engineering experience with Python or TypeScript.
  
  - Proven experience integrating APIs and defining schemas for LLM or automation workflows.
  
  - Understanding of OpenAI / Anthropic tool calling, LangChain, or similar frameworks.
