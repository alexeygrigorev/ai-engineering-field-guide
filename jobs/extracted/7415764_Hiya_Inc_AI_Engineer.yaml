  **About Us**
  
  At Hiya, we're making calls safe, useful, and human again.
  
  Voice is the most human form of communication, yet it's become one of the least trusted. Spam, scams, and AI manipulation have eroded what was once a simple way to connect. 
  
  Each month our AI voice technology analyzes 28+ billion calls, protecting over 550 million users and 800+ businesses worldwide. Partnering with a growing global network including, AT&T, Samsung, British Telecom EE, Rogers, MasOrange,Bell Canada, MasMovil, and Virgin Media O2, we're not just stopping bad actors, we're helping people feel good and confident about picking up the phone again.
  
  This is a pivotal moment for voice. As new threats and technologies accelerate, so does demand for trusted voice communication. Hiya is growing 40%+ year over year, expanding globally, and defining what voice becomes next.
  
  Join us. You won't just work on what voice is today, you'll shape what it becomes tomorrow: smarter, safer, and genuinely worth answering again.
