  🚀 We’re on a mission to make real estate transactions
  smarter, faster, and friction-free.
  
  🏢 Real estate is the world’s largest asset class, yet the
  legal processes and tools behind it remain slow, manual, and
  underinvested. Lawyers must review dense documents line by
  line and piece together information across silos, all while
  clients demand faster, more transparent due diligence.
  
  🤖 That's where we come in. Orbital Copilot is the AI
  assistant built exclusively for commercial real estate law.
  Developed with former practicing real estate lawyers, it
  accelerates complex due diligence by up to 70% while
  delivering legal-grade precision.
  
  🤝 We're trusted by leading firms like Goodwin and BCLP to
  remove the busywork so legal teams can focus on what they do
  best: applying sharp legal judgment, delivering standout
  client service, and getting deals over the line faster.
  
  💡 Working at Orbital means joining a team that's reimagining
  how real estate transactions get done - moving fast, working
  collaboratively, and giving people the ownership to make a
  real impact from day one.
  
  Role Overview 🔎
  
  We are seeking AI Engineers, ranging from mid level to
  senior to join our team as we build and scale innovative AI-
  driven products that bring much-needed transparency to the
  home-buying process and transform the way property is
  transacted. Our current product transforms the way real
  estate professionals conduct due diligence, streamlining the
  analysis of extensive property portfolios previously
  involving tens of thousands of documents reviewed manually
  by legal teams. We’re now evolving this product and
  developing new offerings to add even more value to our
  users.
  
  At Orbital, we leverage the most intelligent, bleeding edge
  models from leading AI labs like OpenAI, Google, Gemini and
  Anthropic. This is an exciting opportunity for someone who
  is passionate about LLMs, AI agents, and agentic
  architecture, and who wants to work at the forefront of AI
  technology in production use cases.
  
  We are looking for Software Engineers who have transitioned
  into AI Engineering, or who have an interest in making that
  transition where you will be working on our cutting edge AI
  agent, Orbital Copilot. While commercial experience in a
  company is a preference, it is not mandatory. What matters
  most is you’re an exceptional technical problem solver,
  interested in applying that skill set when using LLMs and
  agentic principles.
  
  You’ll own the end-to-end design and development of AI-
  driven features and systems, working alongside a dynamic and
  fast-paced team focused on quality, usability, and impact.
  You will play a critical role in every stage of the
  development lifecycle, from discovery and design to
  implementation, deployment, and continuous improvement.
  Supported by a cross-functional team, you will deliver
  impactful solutions initially to lawyers and then to a
  broader B2B customer base.
  
  You’ll get a chance to: 👩‍💻 👨‍💻
  
  - Take ownership of key AI technology decisions and lay the
    groundwork for the company’s ambitious growth plans.
  - Design, develop, and deploy AI-driven systems and features,
    integrating state-of-the-art LLMs.
  - Collaborate with a cross-functional team (AI Engineers, AI
    product managers, VP of AI, real estate legal domain
    experts and software engineers) to define user stories,
    rapidly experiment, and ship new features directly to
    customers to use
  - Explore and implement advanced concepts such as multi-agent
    systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agentic
    architectures and next generation OCR pipelines
  - Champion quality and reuse across the product and the
    codebase.
  - Work across the business to ensure the features you develop
    have a real impact on customers and move key business
    metrics as we design and build a brand-new product that
    doesn’t yet exist in the market.
  - Participate in architecture and code reviews to continuously
    improve the quality, maintainability, security, and
    scalability of our applications.
  
  You should apply if: ✍️
  
  - You have a background in software engineering and have made
    the transition into AI Engineering, or are motivated to
    make that transition.
  - You are excited about the potential of LLMs, AI agents, and
    agentic architectures.
  - You have in depth experience with full stack or backend
    Python development.
  - You value shipping early and often to get customer feedback
    and then iterating quickly to improve the product.
  - You have excellent verbal and written communication skills
    in English.
  - You have proven experience delivering large, complex
    software engineering systems.
  
  It would also be nice if you have:
  
  - Prior experience with LLMs (OpenAI’s GPT-5, o1, and Claude
    models from Anthropic) or agentic systems.
  - Any Frontend experience.
  - Proven expertise in building highly secure, fault-tolerant
    APIs.
  - Experience building high-performance, distributed systems at
    scale.
  - A strong understanding of modern dev practices like 12
    Factor, CI/CD, and observability tools such as Datadog or
    Prometheus.
  - Exposure to GraphQL APIs and WebSockets for real-time
    interactions.
  
  Benefits: 🌟
  
  - Competitive starting salary
  - Matched pension contributions
  - Flexible working hours and location
  - 25 days paid holiday (plus bank holidays)
  - Professional equipment and personal development budget along
    with training opportunities to learn and develop your
    skills
  - Cycle-to-work scheme
  - An inclusive community enjoying all-company off-sites,
    lunches and socials
  
  🔒 Security is everyone’s responsibility at Orbital. We ask
  all team members to follow our security policies, complete
  regular awareness training, and handle sensitive data with
  care in line with ISO 27001 standards. Spot something
  unusual? Reporting risks or incidents quickly helps us
  maintain the strong culture of security and compliance we
  all depend on.
  
  💡 At Orbital, we’re committed to building a diverse and
  inclusive team. We especially welcome applications from
  people who are traditionally underrepresented in tech. Even
  if you don’t meet every single requirement, or if the right
  role isn’t listed yet, we’d still love to hear from you.
  
  💰 This hiring range is a reasonable estimate of the base pay
  range for this position at the time of posting. Pay is based
