  **What the hiring manager says**
  
  You are not expected to be an AI expert, but have a strong interest in transitioning to the role in a senior capacity.
  
  You will be working for a world class AI applications and systems team. This is a new team with the opportunity to play a foundational role. We are moving from a successful proof-of-concept to product prototype phase. You will have the opportunity to learn new techniques and algorithms at the cutting edge of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Model limitations (LLM).
  
  *Dr G.A.McHale, Technical Director, AI & Data Science*
  
  **About the Team**
  
  The team is led by someone with more than 25 years AI experience in bio-inspired architectures, reinforcement learning, expert systems, scheduling, meta-heuristics, robotics and natural language processing (including LLMs). We have recruited an experienced scientific computing developer with a strong mathematics background in theoretical physics, whose responsibilities relate to distributed systems and the GPU optimization of AI algorithms. We expect the team to grow in size considerably over the next few years and are currently looking for someone with complementary expertise as a senior member of the team.
  
  **About the Role**
  
  Key accountabilities include :
  
  These are quite broad based but include initially the optimization of existing algorithms, third-party technology evaluation integration, together with more general programming roles.
