  About Us:
  
  At Fireworks, we’re building the future of generative AI
  infrastructure. Our platform delivers the highest-quality
  models with the fastest and most scalable inference in the
  industry. We’ve been independently benchmarked as the leader
  in LLM inference speed and are driving cutting-edge
  innovation through projects like our own function calling
  and multimodal models. Fireworks is a Series C company
  valued at $4 billion and backed by top investors including
  Benchmark, Sequoia, Lightspeed, Index, and Evantic. We’re an
  ambitious, collaborative team of builders, founded by
  veterans of Meta PyTorch and Google Vertex AI.
  
  The Role:
  
  As a Software Engineer on our AI Infrastructure team, you
  will help design the core systems that power Fireworks AI’s
  generative AI platform. You will help build infrastructure
  and tools that ensure the reliability, performance, quality,
  and availability of our AI system.
  
  Our mission is to make Fireworks AI the most reliable and
  user friendly generative AI platform in the world. You will
  partner closely with our cloud infrastructure team, product
  team, and performance team to deliver infrastructure that
  bridges the gap between our customer and the ultra-
  performant proprietary Fireworks inference engine.
  
  Key Responsibilities:
  
  - Contribute to the design and development of scalable backend
    infrastructure that supports distributed training,
    inference, and data pipelines
  - Build and maintain core backend services such as LLM CI/CD
    pipeline, control plane, and model serving systems
  - Support performance optimization, cost efficiency, and
    reliability improvements across compute, storage, and
    networking layers
  - Building frameworks and safeguards to ensure Fireworks AI
    has the best model quality in the industry
  - Collaborate with performance, training, and product teams to
    translate research and product needs into infrastructure
    solutions
  - Participate in code reviews, technical discussions, and
    continuous integration and deployment processes
  
  Minimum Qualifications:
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a
    related technical field (or equivalent practical
    experience)
  - 3 years of experience in software engineering, with a focus
    on infrastructure or machine learning systems
  - Strong programming skills in Python, Go, or a similar
    language
  - Proven experience in ML infrastructure and tooling (e.g.,
    PyTorch, MLflow, Vertex AI, SageMaker, Kubernetes, etc.).
  - Basic understanding of LLM knowledge (e.g., context length,
    disaggregated prefill, KV cache memory estimation, etc)
  
  Preferred Qualifications:
  
  - 5+ years of experience in software engineering, with a focus
    on infrastructure or machine learning systems
  - Experience with open source inference engine like vLLM,
    Sglang, or TRT-LLM
  - Contributions to open-source infrastructure or ML projects
  - Experience in building large scale ML/MLOps infrastructure
