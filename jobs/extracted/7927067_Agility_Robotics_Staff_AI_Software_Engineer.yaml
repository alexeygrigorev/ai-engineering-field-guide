description: |
  Agility Robotics is a pioneer. Our robot, Digit, is the
  first to be sold into workplaces across the globe. Our team
  is differentiated by its expertise in imagining,
  engineering, and delivering robots with advanced mobility,
  dexterity, intelligence, and efficiency -- robots
  specifically designed to work alongside people, in spaces
  built for people. Every day, we break through engineering
  challenges and invent new solutions and capabilities that
  will one day make robots commonplace and approachable. This
  work is our passion and our responsibility: our mission is
  to make businesses more productive and people’s lives more
  fulfilling.
  
  About The Role
  
  The AI Engineering team builds the models and infrastructure
  that enable Digit to operate autonomously, efficiently, and
  safely. As a Staff AI Core Engineer, you will lead the
  development of the foundational tools, libraries, and data
  systems that power our AI teams to deliver robust and
  scalable learning-based capabilities for Digit.
  
  This is a remote-friendly role with a preference for
  candidates located near one of our offices for in-person
  collaboration, meetings, and events.
  
  About The Work
  
  - Develop data pipelines and curation workflows to maintain
    high-quality datasets for perception, locomotion, and
    manipulation tasks.
  - Design, build, and maintain scalable AI infrastructure,
    including shared libraries, model training pipelines, and
    evaluation frameworks.
  - Build dashboards, visualization tools, and reusable metrics
    to monitor and improve model performance and operational
    readiness.
  - Define and implement testing, validation, and
    reproducibility tools to ensure reliable deployment of
    models on Digit.
  - Collaborate with skills and control teams to integrate
    models efficiently into production systems, including
    real-time execution environments.
  - Promote best practices for data management, experiment
    tracking, and ML operations across the AI Engineering
    organization.
  
  About You
  
  - 8+ years of professional experience in AI infrastructure, ML
    engineering, or MLOps roles.
  - Strong software engineering skills, particularly in Python;
    proficiency in developing scalable, maintainable libraries
    and tools.
  - Experience building and maintaining ML pipelines, from
    dataset curation to training, evaluation, and deployment.
  - Familiarity with training frameworks such as PyTorch or
    TensorFlow.
  - Practical understanding of data-driven model development,
    including dataset management, reproducibility, and
    performance monitoring.
  - Excellent communication skills and a collaborative mindset
    for working across AI, controls, and robotics software
    teams.
  
  Bonus Points
  
  - Experience deploying machine learning models into real-time
    or embedded systems.
  - Experience managing cloud or on-premise GPU clusters,
    distributed training, or high-performance compute
    environments.
  - Familiarity with experiment tracking tools (e.g. MLflow,
    Weights & Biases) and orchestration systems
    (e.g.Kubernetes).
  - Background in robotics, perception, or control system
    applications.
