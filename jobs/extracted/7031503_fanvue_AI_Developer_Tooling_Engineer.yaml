  **Join us in redefining the creator economy with AI**
  
  **Fanvue is one of the fastest-growing creator monetisation platforms globally. We’re an AI-powered, creator-first platform helping creators connect, engage, and earn directly from their audiences at scale. Following our recent Series A, Fanvue has surpassed $100M+ in annual recurring revenue with triple-digit year-on-year growth, supporting hundreds of thousands of creators and millions of fans worldwide.**
  
  As Fanvue scales, how we use AI inside engineering is becoming a critical advantage. This role exists to ensure AI meaningfully accelerates developer velocity, feature delivery, and code quality, while being deployed responsibly, safely, and consistently across the codebase.
  
  🎯 **The Role**
  
  We’re hiring an AI Developer Tooling Engineer to own how AI is applied across Fanvue’s engineering organisation. This is a highly hands-on role focused on making AI a force multiplier for every engineer, not an uncontrolled risk.
  
  You’ll help define the AI coding stack, build the infrastructure and tooling that supports it, and enable the team to ship faster through parallelisation, agents, and AI-assisted workflows, while maintaining high standards for quality, security, and maintainability.
  
  🚀 **What You’ll Do**
  
  - 
  
  Align the Fanvue codebase with modern AI coding tools such as Cursor and Claude Code
  
  - 
  
  Help define, standardise, and roll out Fanvue’s AI-assisted development stack across IDEs, PR workflows, and CI
  
  - 
  
  Build and operate MCP servers and AI-ready infrastructure to enable reliable, context-aware code generation
  
  - 
  
  Enable parallelised development workflows where engineers review and ship AI-generated code confidently
  
  - 
  
  Establish best practices for AI-assisted coding, reviews, and refactoring across the team
  
  - 
  
  Create and maintain documentation, playbooks, and training to drive adoption and safe usage
  
  - 
  
  Track and report measurable improvements in developer productivity such as PR cycle time, throughput, and code quality
  
  - 
  
  Continuously evaluate emerging AI developer tools and vendors, with clear success criteria and kill switches
  
  👀 **Who You Are**
  
  - 
  
  Strong software engineering background with TypeScript in production environments
  
  - 
  
  Deep hands-on experience with AI coding tools such as Cursor and Claude Code, with exposure to Aider, Cline, CodeRabbit, or GitHub Copilot
  
  - 
  
  Experience running MCP servers and related tooling such as Context 7, Puppeteer, or MCP Compass
  
  - 
  
  Comfortable creating, managing, and deploying agent skills across real-world codebases
  
  - 
  
  Strong understanding of LLM fundamentals including RAG pipelines, embeddings, tokenisation, fine-tuning, and performance trade-offs
  
  - 
  
  Confident working with GitHub workflows, CI/CD pipelines, and secure coding practices
  
  - 
  
  Highly autonomous, experimental, and comfortable owning ambiguous problems end to end
  
  - 
  
  Able to demonstrate real, measurable impact from applying AI to engineering workflows
  
  ✨ **You’ll Thrive Here If**
  
  - 
  
  You’re excited by making engineers dramatically more effective, not just building tools for their own sake
  
  - 
  
  You enjoy experimentation, fast iteration, and turning emerging tech into production-ready systems
  
  - 
  
  You think in systems and workflows, not just features
  
  - 
  
  You’re comfortable being accountable for outcomes, not just ideas
  
  ⚠️ **You’ll Struggle Here If**
  
  - 
  
  You prefer narrowly scoped roles with fixed roadmaps
  
  - 
  
  You’re uncomfortable making judgment calls around AI safety, quality, and trade-offs
  
  - 
  
  You need constant direction or heavy process to operate effectively
  
  🌍 **Why Join Fanvue?**
  
  - 
  
  Play a critical role in defining how AI is used responsibly at scale inside engineering
  
  - 
  
  Direct impact on developer velocity, feature delivery, and product quality
  
  - 
  
  Work closely with senior engineers and leadership across the company
  
  - 
  
  Competitive salary and benefits package
  
  - 
  
  Unlimited holiday
  
  - 
  
  Remote working
  
  - 
  
  Flexible hours, according to when you perform best
