  SmartAssets is on the lookout for an experienced and

  About SmartAssets:
  
  Incubated within the Stagwell Marketing Cloud, our AI
  platform empowers brands and creative agencies to produce
  high-quality advertising content by providing insight into
  the effectiveness of their creative choices. As part of the
  Stagwell Marketing Cloud, we leverage industry-leading
  technology and enjoy privileged access to agencies across
  the advertising spectrum.
  
  Our Values:
  
  - Collaboration. We believe that bringing together different
    and varied expertise delivers results greater than the sum
    of their parts. Part of collaboration is ensuring we
    challenge each other constructively. This way we ensure
    that what we are building is really robust, and that we
    have mutual understanding and transparency.
  - Curiosity. We want to know why an ad works or doesn’t work.
    We want to get under the skin of what engages and audience
    and moves them to action. We believe that data is key to
    the creative process and enables us to really celebrate
    excellence in advertising. Something not working is still
    a valuable data point, which we embrace, bringing science
    into the art of advertising. We want to know what we don’t
    know.
  - Commitment. Bringing innovation to the market requires
    belief and drive. We have incredible momentum and great
    backing. We must remain committed to making SmartAssets
    the success we know it can be, focusing on what clients
    really need and delivering against that every single day.
