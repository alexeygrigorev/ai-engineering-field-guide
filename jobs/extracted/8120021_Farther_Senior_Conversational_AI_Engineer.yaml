  Company Description
  
  Farther is a rapidly growing RIA that combines expert
  advisors with cutting-edge technology - delivering a
  comprehensive, tailored wealth management experience.
  
  Farther’s founders are leaders and innovators from the
  private wealth industry who possess a unique blend of
  traditional wealth management, fintech, and technology
  production expertise. We’re backed by top-tier venture
  capital firms, fintech investors, and industry leaders.
  
  Joining Farther means joining a collaborative team of
  entrepreneurs who are passionate about helping their clients
  and our teammates achieve more. If you’re the type who
  breaks through walls to get things done the right way, we
  want to build the future of wealth management with you.
  
  The Role
  
  You'll architect the conversational AI systems, transforming
  how clients and advisors interact with our platform. We're
  moving from traditional web interfaces to intelligent,
  agentic experiences – think LinkedIn's AI service agent
  model where chatbots handle real financial transactions end-
  to-end. We want builders who ship production AI, not
  researchers. You'll have real autonomy, make architectural
  decisions, and own outcomes. We operate differently – you're
  measured by results, not process.
  
  Your Impact
  
  - Own conversational AI features end-to-end, from requirements
    through production deployment
  - Architect chatbot systems using LLMs, RAG pipelines, and
    agentic workflows
  - Build with professional engineering standards – testing,
    observability, reliability, redundancy
  - Develop guardrails and authorization boundaries for AI
    agents handling sensitive financial data
  - Jump into difficult problems with tenacity – production
    issues, complex prompt engineering, unfamiliar model
    behaviors
  - Collaborate directly with product, data engineering, and
    business stakeholders
  
  The Ideal Match
  
  - 5+ years software engineering experience with backend focus
  - Experience building conversational AI or chatbot
    applications in production
  - Strong Python and SQL skills – this is fundamentally a
    Python engineering role
  - Hands-on experience with LLMs, prompt engineering, RAG
    patterns, and agent frameworks
  - Professional delivery experience at Fortune 500 or
    equivalent enterprise environment
  - Self-directed and autonomous – you thrive with ownership and
    prefer results over rigid process
  - Product-focused mindset – AI exists to solve business
    problems!
  
  Bonus Points
  
  - Financial services or trading systems background
  - MLOps and production ML deployment experience
  - LLM evaluation frameworks and human-in-the-loop systems
  - Multi-step agent workflows and streaming interfaces
