  **WHO WE ARE:** MagicSchool is the premier generative AI platform for teachers. We're just over 2 years old, and more than 7 million teachers from all over the world have joined our platform. Join a top team at a fast growing company that is working towards real social impact. Make an account and try us out at our website and connect with our passionate community on our Wall of Love.
  
  **The Role**
  
  As a Senior Context Engineer for AI Systems, you'll architect and optimize how MagicSchool's AI agents reason, remember, and operate within complex educational workflows. You'll design context management systems that determine what information our agents see, how they maintain state across multi-turn interactions, and how they retrieve knowledge without overwhelming their attention budget—ensuring reliable, coherent AI assistance for educators.
  
  In this role you'll implement the technical foundation of how AI agents manage their "mental workspace", and ensure our agentic capabilities remain accurate and focused in classroom scenarios.
  
  **What You'll Do**
  
  **Context Pipeline Architecture**
  
  - 
  
  **Context Architecture & Token Optimization**: Architect and implement adaptive context curation pipelines that determine what information enters each agent inference step, balancing comprehensiveness with the finite attention budget of LLMs to prevent context rot.
  
  - 
  
  **Long-Horizon Task Management**: Invent and operationalize memory compaction mechanisms and state management patterns that allow agents to maintain coherence across extended teaching workflows (lesson planning, differentiation, assessment creation).
  
  - 
  
  **Context Evaluation & Monitoring**: Design evaluation pipelines that measure retrieval precision, token relevance, and reasoning coherence as context evolves across sessions. Work with the evaluations team on developing frameworks for measuring attention allocation and agent performance degradation.
  
  **Dynamic Information Retrieval**
  
  - 
  
  **Just-in-Time Knowledge Retrieval**: Build dynamic, runtime data fetching systems that enable agents to autonomously pull relevant curriculum content, student data, and educational resources exactly when needed, rather than pre-loading context with unnecessary information.
  
  **Tooling & Integration Design**
  
  - 
  
  **Tool & Integration Design**: Engineer token-efficient tool APIs and retrieval layers where each tool earns its place in the context window through clear utility and minimal overlap, with robust metadata to guide agent decision-making.
  
  **Cross-Functional & Educational Domain Collaboration**
  
  - 
  
  **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Partner with Product, Research, and Education teams to translate complex educational workflows into optimal context configurations, understanding which information signals matter most for different teaching scenarios.
  
  - 
  
  **Model & Platform Integration**: Collaborate with ML researchers and platform engineers to co-design architectures that integrate memory modules, retrieval adapters, and human-in-the-loop correction systems.
  
  **Mentorship & Standards**
  
  - 
  
  **Technical Mentorship**: Guide engineers on context engineering patterns, teaching the shift from prompt-first thinking to holistic context management, token budget awareness, and dynamic information curation.
  
  **What We're Looking For**
  - 
  
  4+ years building distributed systems. Hands-on experience with RAG systems, knowledge graphs, or semantic search platforms in production environments.
  
  - 
  
  Strong coding skills in Python, TypeScript/Node.js. Experience with our stack (TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, NextJS, Supabase) or similar. Proficiency with LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and their context management patterns.
  
  - 
  
  Experience with Model Context Protocol (MCP), context window optimization for specific model families, or building context-aware agent frameworks.
  
  - 
  
  Understanding of or interest in how educational content is structured (standards, curricula, taxonomies), privacy requirements (FERPA/COPPA), and how context needs differ across teaching scenarios.
  
  - 
  
  Experience with agent evaluation, measuring context quality/relevance, or instrumentation for attention budget tracking.
  
  - 
  
  Knowledge of curriculum standards, learning progressions, or educational metadata schemas that inform context design.
  
  **Nice to Have**
  - 
  
  Familiarity with educational technology platforms, curriculum databases, or EdTech content management
  
  - 
  
  Background in semantic search or hybrid retrieval systems
  
  - 
  
  Knowledge of curriculum standards, learning progressions, or educational metadata schemas that inform context design
