  Multiverse is the upskilling platform for AI and Tech
  adoption.
  
  We have partnered with 1,500+ companies to deliver a new
  kind of learning that's transforming today’s workforce.
  
  Our upskilling apprenticeships are designed for people of
  any age and career stage to build critical AI, data, and
  tech skills. Our learners have driven $2bn+ ROI for their
  employers, using the skills they’ve learned to improve
  productivity and measurable performance.
  
  In June 2022, we announced a $220 million Series D funding
  round co-led by StepStone Group, Lightspeed Venture Partners
  and General Catalyst. With a post-money valuation of $1.7bn,
  the round makes us the UK’s first EdTech unicorn.
  
  But we aren’t stopping there. With a strong operational
  footprint and 800+ employees, we have ambitious plans to
