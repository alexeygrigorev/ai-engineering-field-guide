  **Position Description: **
  
  At PAR Technology, we are focused on using AI to provide better products for the people who use our solutions. We're looking for an engineer with strong experience in LLM integration and AI product development to help turn our restaurant data and AI capabilities into a meaningful, differentiating part of our user experience.
  
  This role combines hands-on engineering, product-level influence, and architecture — designing and building intelligent, multi-step pipelines that use LLMs, tools, and data to solve complex user and product problems.
  
  **Position Location:**
  
  Remote, United States
  
  **Reports To: **
  
  Director, Software Engineering
  
  **What We’re Looking For:**
  
  • 5+ years’ experience as a software engineer, ideally within a SaaS or data-centric product environment
  
  • Proficiency with LLM platforms and APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI)
  
  • Familiarity with prompt engineering, embedding models, and vector databases
  
  • Experience designing and implementing multi-step AI workflow chains (e.g., LangChain, Semantic Kernel, custom pipelines)
  
  • Strong data skills, including proficiency with SQL and structured datasets in production
  
  • Understanding of cloud-based orchestration tools like Azure Data Factory or equivalents
  
  • Experience taking AI features from prototype to production with attention to scalability, cost-efficiency, and observability
  
  • Strong communication skills and ability to work cross-functionally with product, engineering, and data teams
  
  • Recognized as an internal driver of AI strategy and implementation, setting standards and best practices for trustworthy, scalable AI
  
  Additional Skills (Nice-to-Haves):
  
  • Experience working with data-rich applications, especially in retail, hospitality, or restaurant operations
  
  • Exposure to data visualization, analytics platforms, or reporting tools
  
  • Experience with traditional machine learning workflows (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
  
  **Unleash your potential: What you will be doing and owning:**
  
   • LLM-Powered Product Features: Design and build user-facing AI capabilities that simplify decision-making, surface insights, and enable faster action for operational teams. These features will be actively used by customers and help drive adoption and retention.
  
  • AI Workflow Chains: Create and maintain multi-step LLM workflows (chains) that combine prompts, tools, and data to execute complex tasks—enabling conversational agents, data-powered assistants, and automation flows that deliver measurable process improvements.
  
  • Data-Enriched AI Capabilities: Use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to combine internal data with LLMs and generate context-aware, trustworthy results. These capabilities will evolve into trusted product experiences.
  
  • Wow Factor Experiences: Deliver features that set PAR apart from the competition and provide tangible value to users—leading to greater product adoption and customer retention.
