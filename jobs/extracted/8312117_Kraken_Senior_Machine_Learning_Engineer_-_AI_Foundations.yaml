  Help us use technology to make a big green dent in the universe!
  
  Kraken powers some of the most innovative global developments in energy.
  
  We’re a technology company focused on creating a smart, sustainable energy system. From optimising renewable generation, creating a more intelligent grid and enabling utilities to provide excellent customer experiences, our operating system for energy is transforming the industry around the world in a way that benefits everyone.
  
  It’s a really exciting time in energy. Help us make a real impact on shaping a better, more sustainable future.
  
  You’ll work in the AI Foundations **team which exists to enable AI across the entire company. We build the shared platforms, tooling and patterns that enable engineering & product teams to safely, reliably and efficiently use machine learning and generative AI across the business. This is not a research lab. This is a delivery-focused team that sits at the intersection of platform engineering, applied ML and developer enablement.
  
  **
  
  We’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer to join our AI Foundations team. You’ll be building the core ML and AI capabilities that other teams rely on that make AI easy to adopt and hard to misuse. This role suits someone who enjoys thinking in systems, cares about engineering quality, and wants their work to multiply the impact of others.
  
  What You'll Do**
  
  - This role differs from product-embedded ML roles - your focus will be foundational capability, not a single feature or model.
  
  - Build and maintain the foundational AI gateways and inference services used across Kraken to provide reliable and efficient access to ML and generative AI models.
  
  - Architect and evolve internal evaluation tooling and monitoring frameworks that allow teams to measure the performance, quality, and safety of their systems at scale. 
  
  - Act as a technical mentor by teaching software engineers and ML specialists how to adopt foundational capabilities, ensuring AI is easy to use and integrated into everyday development. 
  
  - Create and maintain high-quality documentation, internal guidance, and technical standards to help teams understand when and how to use AI effectively. 
  
  - Continuously improve Kraken's approach to AI enablement by balancing speed, cost, and quality within the infrastructure you manage. 
  
  - Work pragmatically - favouring solutions that work in production over theoretical perfection.
  
  **What We're Looking For**
  
  - ~3 years of professional experience as a Machine Learning Engineer or similar applied ML role.
  
  - Strong Python skills and experience with common ML libraries and frameworks.
  
  - Practical experience taking ML models from development into production.
  
  - Good understanding of software engineering fundamentals (version control, testing, CI/CD etc).Experience working with cloud infrastructure and data pipelines.
  
  - An ability to explain ML concepts clearly to non-ML engineers.A bias towards action, learning quickly, and improving systems over time.
  
  - Prior experience building internal platforms or shared tooling.
  
  - Exposure to MLOps practices, including model monitoring, evaluation, and deployment automation.
  
  - Familiarity with considerations regarding data privacy, security, or responsible AI.
