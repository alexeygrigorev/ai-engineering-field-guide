  About Northbeam
  
  Northbeam is building the world's most advanced marketing
  intelligence platform, providing top eCommerce brands a
  unified view of their business data through powerful
  attribution modeling and customizable dashboards. Our
  technology helps customers accurately track ad spend,
  understand the full customer journey, and drive profitable
  growth.
  
  We're experiencing rapid growth, have strong product-market
  fit, and are looking for the right people to help us scale.
  This is a rare chance to make a meaningful impact at a fast-
  moving, high-growth company. At Northbeam, you'll join a
  team of driven, collaborative, and talented individuals who
  value personal growth and excellence. We'd love for you to
  be part of our journey.
  
  We're a remote-friendly company with offices in San
  Francisco and Los Angeles.
  
  About the Role
  
  You’ll act as the automation layer across the company,
  uncovering inefficiencies, building AI-powered workflows and
  agents, and turning scrappy experiments into scalable
  systems. This role blends builder, hacker, and strategist:
  part internal consultant, part product-minded engineer, part
  creative problem solver. If you love turning messy, manual
  processes into elegant automations and care deeply about
  business impact, this role is for you.
  
  Your Impact
  
  Discover High-Leverage Opportunities
  
  - Shadow teams across marketing, sales, product, finance, and
    ops to understand workflows end-to-end
  - Run automation and AI audits to identify repetitive, high-
    friction processes
  - Translate vague problems (“this takes too long”) into clear
    automation opportunities
  
  Prototype & Build
  
  - Design and build no-code / low-code workflows using tools
    like n8n, Gumloop, Zapier, Make, Airtable, Notion,
    Langflow, Relevance AI, and similar platforms
  - Integrate internal and external systems via APIs, webhooks,
    JSON, and light scripting
  - Leverage Northbeam data and APIs to power intelligent
    workflows and agents
  
  Deploy, Scale & Maintain
  
  - Move successful experiments into production-ready systems
  - Monitor performance, reliability, and edge cases
  - Document workflows clearly so others can understand, extend,
    and maintain them
  
  Drive Growth with AI
  
  - Build AI-driven workflows for:
    - Lead generation and enrichment
    - Campaign and creative research
    - Competitive intelligence
    - Sales and marketing enablement
  - Partner with Growth, Marketing, and Sales to unlock new
    leverage with automation
  
  Experiment Creatively
  
  - Push boundaries and explore new AI agent patterns
  - Build scrappy internal tools that give Northbeam an unfair
    advantage
  - Stay on top of emerging AI, automation, and agent frameworks
    and apply them pragmatically
  
  What You Bring
  
  - Strong fluency with no-code / low-code automation tools
    (n8n, Gumloop, Zapier, Make, Airtable, Notion, etc.)
  - Comfort working with APIs, JSON, webhooks, and basic
    scripting in Python or JavaScript
  - A product and business mindset. You optimize for outcomes,
    not novelty
  - A true builder personality: scrappy, resourceful, curious,
    and persistent
  - Ability to turn ambiguous problems into clear, automated
    workflows
  - Excellent communication and documentation skills
  
  Bonus Skills & Experience
  
  - Experience in marketing tech, SaaS, or growth-focused
    environments
  - Exposure to AI agent frameworks or multi-step agent
    workflows
  - A portfolio of automation or AI projects you can share
    (personal, freelance, or internal tools all count)

  Interview Process The interview process varies by role but
  typically begins with a 30-minute interview with a Northbeam
  recruiter, followed by a video interview with the hiring
  manager. Next, candidates complete a role-specific video
  interview followed by video or onsite interviews with
  several team members. The final step is a video interview
