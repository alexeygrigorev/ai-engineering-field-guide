  **Let’s fix hospitality, for good.**
  
  Hospitality is tough – margins are thin, waste is high, and teams are stretched. But it doesn’t have to be this hard. That’s why we built **Nory**.
  
  Our CEO, Conor, knows the pain first-hand. After founding and scaling Mad Egg in Ireland, he got fed up with juggling “market-leading” systems, clunky spreadsheets, and endless printouts. So he set out to build the tool he wished he’d had from day one.
  
  Nory is an all-knowing restaurant management system. It blends real-time data with AI predictive analytics, giving operators control of their margins. From food prep to forecasting, it’s operational intelligence that helps restaurants run with consistency, certainty, and profit. The result? Thriving restaurants, better jobs, less waste, healthier margins. Learn more about what we are building here. 
  
  And we’re just getting started. Fresh off a Series B led by Kinnevik, we’ve grown to 80+ people across Ireland, the UK, Spain and New York – and demand is scaling faster than we ever imagined.
  
  **The role**
  
  We are now hiring our** first Senior AI Product Engineer** - **first and foremost, a senior software engineer** who can architect, build, **operate**, and **own production-grade backend systems** that use agentic workflows and LLMs. This is not a research role and not a chatbot feature role. You will be building reliable, scalable backend services that run in production and deliver real-time intelligence to thousands of operators. If you are a senior engineer who has built, shipped, and run multi-step agentic systems in production, you will thrive here.
  
  **What you’ll be doing**
  
  As a Senior AI Product Engineer, you will own AI-powered backend systems end-to-end, from design through to live operation. 
  
  - 
  
  **Owning production AI systems**, including reliability, monitoring, alerting, and on-call responsibility
  
  - 
  
  Designing and building **backend services** that incorporate multi-step agentic workflows
  
  - 
  
  Turning prototypes and ideas into **shipped, customer-facing features**, then iterating based on real usage
  
  - 
  
  Designing agent workflows with **explicit handling of failures, retries, and edge cases**
  
  - 
  
  Integrating LLM-powered capabilities into core Nory workflows in **collaboration with Product and Data**
  
  - 
  
  Making pragmatic trade-offs around **latency, cost, accuracy, and user trust**
  
  - 
  
  **Establishing best practices** for how Nory builds and operates agentic systems at scale
  
  **Your first 6 months at Nory**
  - 
  
  Take ownership of existing agent prototypes and ship them as stable, production-ready systems
  
  - 
  
  Deliver at least one agent-backed feature used by real restaurant operators
  
  - 
  
  Design and implement monitoring, evaluation, and failure handling for live agent systems
  
  - 
  
  Partner closely with Product and Data to ensure AI features drive clear user and commercial outcomes
  
  - 
  
  Establish patterns and practices that make AI systems easier to build, operate, and scale across teams
  
  **What you’ll bring**
  
  This role is designed for engineers who have personally built, shipped, and operated production backend systems that use LLMs or agentic workflows.
  
  - 
  
  **Strong backend engineering fundamentals.** You can design APIs and services, write maintainable code, and reason about system architecture, scalability, and SLAs. We use Python, but language matters less than engineering depth.
  
  - 
  
  **Production experience with agentic workflows.** You have owned multi-step agent systems in production, including tool use, orchestration, retries, and failure handling. Experience limited to demos, chatbots, or internal experiments is not sufficient for this role.
  
  - 
  
  **Ownership of long-lived systems.** You are comfortable monitoring, debugging, and iterating on live services over time.
  
  - 
  
  **Applied LLM experience in real products.** You’ve worked with prompts, embeddings, retrieval, and evaluation in production systems – pragmatically, not experimentally.
  
  - 
  
  **High autonomy in ambiguous environments.** You are comfortable owning problems end-to-end, making trade-offs, and moving forward without perfect specs.
  
  - 
  
  **Product and commercial mindset.** You make technical decisions based on user behaviour, operational impact, and business outcomes.
  
  *Nice-to-have:*
  
  - 
  
  Background in operational, B2B, or data-heavy products
  
  - 
  
  Experience operating AI systems at scale or in high-traffic environments
  
  - 
  
  Experience helping define internal engineering standards or best practices
  
  - 
  
  Familiarity with cloud infrastructure, data platforms, or analytics pipelines
  
  **What you’ll get in return:**
  
  🌐 Remote-first working environment
  
  💰 Competitive salary range depending on experience
  
  📈 Meaningful equity, at Nory everyone is an owner!
  
  🌴 35 days of paid leave per year (including bank holidays)
