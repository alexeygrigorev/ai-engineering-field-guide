  At Atrix, our journey began with a simple belief:
  **Breakthrough medicines and technologies change lives, and the people making them deserve better tools.**
  
  We often celebrate the final moment: a patient receiving a life-saving therapy or a groundbreaking treatment becoming standard of care.
  But behind that moment is a complex, coordinated effort that begins years earlier.
  
  Pharmaceutical and med device companies shoulder this responsibility every day:
  
  - 
  
  Advancing science from lab to clinic
  
  - 
  
  Navigating regulatory and access barriers
  
  - 
  
  Ensuring safe, evidence-based adoption in the real world
  
  They’re not just bringing products to market; they’re shaping the future of care.
  
  Yet these organizations are often held back by outdated workflows and siloed data, unable to fully harness the knowledge that already exists across their teams.
  
  **Atrix was built to change that.**
  
  We exist to support the mission of those who dedicate their lives to creating and delivering innovations that impact global health.
  
  **The Role Description****
  
  As a Forward Deployed Engineer, you will sit at the intersection of **engineering, implementation, and customer value**. You’ll partner directly with enterprise pharma and biotech teams to turn complex scientific workflows into reliable, AI-powered systems that accelerate evidence generation, medical strategy, commercial insights, and patient impact.
  
  You will become the technical owner of several key customer accounts, embedding deeply into their workflows, translating their needs into structured requirements, configuring Atrix’s AI-native platform, and ensuring accuracy, trust, and real-world reliability.
  
  This is one of the most impactful roles at Atrix. **You’ll see your work used daily by medical, clinical, and commercial teams making high-stakes decisions.
  
  You’ll work closely with our **Engineering Team and CEO**, and collaborate as a peer to product, design, and GTM leadership. As one of our **earliest FDEs**, you’ll help define technical architecture, influence product strategy, and set the tone for future engineering hires.
  
  💡 This is an **hybrid role based in NYC (ability to be in office is required)**, with flexibility for remote work on some days as needed.
  
  **Responsibilities****
  
  This role is perfect for someone who is customer-obsessed, technically fluent, and thrives in fast-moving startup environments. If you love the challenge of translating AI workflows into intuitive product experiences in a high-stakes industry, we want to talk to you.

  - 
  
  Lead weekly customer calls and serve as the primary technical point of contact
  
  ****Rapid Prototyping & Product Co-Creation****
  - 
  
  Build quick prototypes and workflow experiments for GTM initiatives
  
  - 
  
  Translate customer needs into clear product requirements
  
  - 
  
  Triage bugs, uncover feature gaps, and partner with engineering to implement fixes or enhancements
  
  -

  Own 3–5 enterprise accounts end-to-end within 6 months
  
  - 
  
  Identify patterns across accounts and surface scalable templates or product opportunities
  
  - 
  
  Become a trusted technical advisor to medical, clinical, and commercial stakeholders
  
  **Must haves**
  
  - 
  
  **2–5 years** in forward deployed engineering, software engineering, solutions engineering, technical consulting, ML implementation, data engineering, or adjacent roles
  
  - 
  
  **CS degree is required if non-software engineering role held in past.**

  Instead of a traditional cover letter and resume, we’d like you to complete a short task to show how you work:
  
  ****Step 1****
  
  Use an AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) to generate **3–5 short, fake customer interaction notes**.**These should look like quick snippets from a customer support chat (e.g., a frustrated user, a neutral inquiry, a positive message).
  
  **Step 2****
  
  Using the same AI tool, create:
  ****1. A simple checklist-style sentiment rubric****
  
  This should include:
  
  - 
  
  The sentiment categories you choose (e.g., Positive, Neutral, Negative).
  
  - 
  
  Short definitions for each category.
  
  - 
  
  1–2 criteria the evaluator/model should look for.
  
  ****2. A short description (1–2 paragraphs) explaining:****
  - 
  
  How you used the AI tool.
  
  - 
  
  What prompts you wrote.
  
  - 
  
  Any challenges you encountered (e.g., model over-explaining, unclear sentiment boundaries).
  
  ****Step 3****
  
  Send us your:
  
  - 
  
  **Customer interaction notes**
  
  - 
  
  **Sentiment rubric (checklist)**
  
  - 
  
  **LLM usage notes**
  
  These can be in a Google Doc, Word Doc, or PDF.
