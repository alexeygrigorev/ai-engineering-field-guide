  ****About Distyl AI****
  
  Distyl AI develops production-grade AI systems to power core operational workflows for Fortune 500 companies. Powered by a strategic partnership with OpenAI, in-house software accelerators, and deep enterprise AI expertise, we deliver working AI systems with rapid time to value – within a quarter.
  
  Our products have helped Fortune 500 customers across diverse industries, from insurance and CPG to non-profits. As part of our team, you will help companies identify, build, and realize value from their GenAI investments, often for the first time. We are customer-centric, working backward from the customer’s problem and holding ourselves accountable for creating both financial impact and improving the lives of end-users.
  
  Distyl is led by proven leaders from top companies like Palantir and Apple and is backed by Lightspeed, Khosla, Coatue, Dell Technologies Capital, Nat Friedman (Former CEO of GitHub), Brad Gerstner (Founder and CEO of Altimeter), and board members of over a dozen Fortune 500 companies.
  
  ****What We Are Looking For****
  
  We’re hiring early-career / new-graduate AI Engineers who are excited to build real-world AI systems and grow quickly in a fast-paced, customer-facing environment. As a new grad at Distyl, you’ll be a hands-on contributor from day one, working alongside experienced engineers to design, implement, and deploy production-grade AI systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
  
  This role offers structured exposure to both technical engineering work and real-world business applications of AI. You’ll begin by learning through hands-on development and shadowing customer work, and over time grow into greater ownership of technical decisions and solution design.
  
  This role is ideal for candidates who have strong technical fundamentals, a passion for AI, and a desire to learn how cutting-edge GenAI systems are built and deployed in enterprise settings.

  Write clean, well-tested, and observable code that meets reliability, performance, and security standards
  
  - 
  
  Learn how production AI systems are monitored, debugged, and improved over time**
  
  **Evaluate and Improve AI Systems****
  - 
  
  Assist with evaluating AI systems across accuracy, latency, cost, and robustness.
  
  - 
  
  Apply feedback from users and metrics to improve system performance**
  
  **Grow as an Engineer****
  - 
  
  Continuously develop your skills in LLMs, software engineering, and AI through mentorship, code reviews, and hands-on project work
