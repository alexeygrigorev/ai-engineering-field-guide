  About the Role:
  
  We’re looking for a Sr. Full-Stack Engineer to join the
  Applied AI team to build the core infrastructure that powers
  our next generation of AI-powered health experiences.
  
  Our Applied AI organization is building the foundation for
  all AI-powered products and experiences at Hims & Hers. This
  team is responsible for the models, platforms, tools, and
  systems that enable intelligent, safe, and scalable health
  automation — from conversational agents and care coaching to
  logistics and fulfillment.
  
  The ideal candidate is curious, action-oriented, and deeply
  technical — someone who loves learning, experiments fast,
  and iterates toward high-quality outcomes. You’re a fast
  learner who thrives at the intersection of AI, systems, and
  product engineering. You care about building technology that
  improves patient care, makes providers more effective, and
  simplifies complex health operations. You’ll work across
  TypeScript and Python, collaborating with AI researchers,
  product managers, and data scientists to bring powerful,
  safe AI features to life.
  
  You Will:
  
  - Design and build scalable AI workflow systems — including
    orchestration runtimes, SDKs, and observability pipelines
    that power real-time, intelligent experiences.
  - Develop end-to-end features using TypeScript (Cloudflare
    Workers, React/Next.js) and Python (Databricks,
    evaluation, data processing).
  - Integrate and evaluate large language models (LLMs) and
    other ML systems (OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex, Databricks)
    via a unified AI Gateway.
  - Build tool connectors and APIs for our internal domains —
    EHR, Pharmacy, Payments, Orders, Care — enabling safe and
    automated cross-system workflows.
  - Develop evaluation and feedback systems that measure
    quality, grounding, latency, and safety of AI-powered
    flows.
  - Partner closely with AI, Product, and Infra teams to design,
    prototype, and iterate quickly — turning research into
    production capabilities.
  - Contribute to shared TypeScript and Python SDKs that
    standardize event schemas, tool contracts, and developer
    experience across Applied AI.
  - Ensure everything you build meets security-by-design and
    privacy-first principles, supporting HIPAA and compliance
    requirements.
  - Foster a build → measure → learn culture by testing fast,
    gathering feedback, and continuously improving the system.
  
  You Have:
  
  - 4+ years of professional full-stack experience, spanning
    backend APIs, frontend apps, infra, and data systems.
  - Proficient in TypeScript (Node.js, React) and Python (data
    pipelines, ML evaluation, orchestration).
  - Familiarity with LLM- or ML-based systems, including prompt
    orchestration, evaluation harnesses, or RAG pipelines.
  - Experience with workflow orchestration tools
  - Understanding of system design for AI workloads — including
    state management, retries, idempotency, and performance
    optimization.
  - Experience with data/ML infrastructure (Databricks, AWS,
    vector stores, or BigQuery).
  - A bias toward action and iteration — you build fast,
    validate ideas early, and improve based on results.
  - Collaborative mindset, with strong communication skills.
  - Awareness of AI lifecycle management — from experimentation
    and evaluation to safety and deployment.
  
  Nice to Have:
  
  - Building AI evaluation or observability systems, such as
    LLM-as-a-judge frameworks or human review pipelines.
  - Experience with Databricks, Cloudflare Durable Objects, or
    other edge orchestration systems.
  - Background in healthcare, life sciences, or regulated
    industries.
  - Contributions to open-source SDKs or AI infrastructure
    projects.
  - Experience creating visual workflow editors or n8n-style
    automation tools.
  
  Our Benefits (there are more but here are some highlights):
  
  - Competitive salary & equity compensation for full-time roles
  - Unlimited PTO, company holidays, and quarterly mental health
    days
  - Comprehensive health benefits including medical, dental &
    vision, and parental leave
  - Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP)
  - 401k benefits with employer matching contribution
  - Offsite team retreats
  
  We are committed to building a workforce that reflects
  diverse perspectives and prioritizes ethics, wellness, and a
  strong sense of belonging. If you're excited about this
  role, we encourage you to apply—even if you're not sure if
  your background or experience is a perfect match.
