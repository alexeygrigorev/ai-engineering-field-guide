  About ngrok Inc.
  
  ngrok is an all-in-one cloud networking platform that
  secures, transforms, and routes traffic to services running
  anywhere. Instead of cobbling together nginx, NLBs, VPNs,
  model routers, and oodles other tools, developers solve
  every networking problem with one gateway. Doesn’t matter if
  they’re sharing localhost or running AI workloads in
  production.
  
  We're trusted by more than 9 million developers at companies
  like GitHub, Okta, HashiCorp, and Twilio. What started as a
  way to put your local app on a public URL has grown into a
  universal gateway for API delivery, AI inference, device
  fleets, and site-to-site connectivity. It’s the same ngrok
  that millions of developers have loved and leaned on every
  day for years, now with the power to run production traffic
  at scale.
  
  A few things you should know:
  
  - Our mascot is a rock
  - We are obsessed with our pets, Viper sunglasses and Bufo
    (yes, the toad)
  - We have a designated Chief Emoji Officer - they are vital to
    our success!
  - We like software that’s serious and culture that’s not
  
  Most people skim to 'requirements' and bounce. You're
  actually reading this. That's the kind of thoroughness we
  respect, or you're just procrastinating. Either way, same
  same and you should keep reading.
  
  About the AI Gateway Team
  
  Our AI Gateway team builds the systems that define how AI
  traffic is identified, controlled, and understood as it
  passes through ngrok.
  
  We own the AI-specific control plane at the gateway layer:
  policies, usage tracking, and enforcement that sit directly
  on live customer traffic. Our systems must behave correctly
  under real-world conditions—traffic spikes, unexpected model
  behavior, misconfigured policies, and customers asking, “Why
  was this blocked?” or “Where did my tokens go?”
  
  What You’ll Actually Do
  
  - Build and evolve the AI Gateway: You’ll work on the AI-aware
    gateway components that classify and handle AI traffic in
    real time. This code runs directly in the request path and
    must be fast, safe, and predictable.
  - Own AI traffic policy enforcement: You’ll design and
    implement AI Gateway Traffic Policy Objects—rate limits,
    usage caps, and access rules specific to AI workloads.
    These policies exist to prevent runaway costs, misuse, and
    accidental exposure without breaking legitimate traffic.
  - Track AI usage and token consumption: You’ll build and
    maintain systems that accurately measure AI
    usage—requests, tokens, and related metadata—so customers
    can understand how their AI systems behave and what
    they’re consuming.
  - Make AI behavior observable and explainable: You’ll expose
    clear, trustworthy signals around AI traffic: what was
    allowed or blocked, which policies applied, and how usage
    accumulated. When customers ask “what happened?”, the
    gateway should already know.
  - Design abstractions that hide complexity: You’ll work with
    product and design to build AI-specific gateway primitives
    that feel intentional and safe, without leaking provider
    quirks or infrastructure details into customer workflows.
  - Ship systems customers trust in production: You’ll
    collaborate closely with Gateway, Customer Data, and
    Platform teams to ensure AI usage data, policy
    enforcement, and billing signals line up—so customers can
    turn these features on with confidence.
  
  You Might Be a Great Fit If…
  
  - You’re comfortable in a statically typed, compiled language
    such as Go, Rust, C++, or Java (with bonus points for Go)
  - You’ve worked with AI/LLMs and can appreciate their unique
    brand of edge-cases
  - You care about developer experience and thoughtful
    abstractions
  - You enjoy defining system behavior, not just plumbing
  - You’ve thought about retries, limits, and costs before being
    asked
  - You like systems that move complexity from the user to the
    system
  
  Extra credit if you’ve worked on:
  
  - AI platforms or inference infrastructure
  - API gateways with product-level opinions
  - Usage limits, quotas, or billing-adjacent systems
  - Customer-facing observability tools
  
  Tech Stack
  
  ngrok runs entirely on AWS. Engineers develop by using
  remote development tools and/or ssh to connect to remote EC2
  environments that run a full Kubernetes cluster of the ngrok
  stack, closely mirroring production. The codebase is
  primarily Go and TypeScript. We use Postgres for
  persistence, Kafka for streaming, Protobuf for service
  boundaries, and Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm, and Buildkite
  to operate and ship reliably. React is used for user
  interfaces, and GitHub supports our development workflows
  and remembers everything.
  
  Location
  
  This is a remote position for candidates outside of the Bay
  Area and a hybrid role for candidates within commuting
  distance to San Francisco. Our Bay Area employees commute to
  the office on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
  
  Sponsorship
  
  All candidates must be US-based, and legally authorized to
  work in the United States.
  
  At this time, ngrok is unable to provide visa sponsorship
  for this position. Applicants must be authorized to work in
  the United States on a permanent, ongoing basis without the
  need for current or future sponsorship.
