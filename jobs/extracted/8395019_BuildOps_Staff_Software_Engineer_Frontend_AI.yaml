description: |
  At BuildOps, we’re building a groundbreaking software
  solution, purpose-built to support today’s commercial
  contractors. From helping our customers manage their service
  department all the way to project management, we’re breaking
  the mold and building a team that invests in our mission
  statement. We love driven, self-motivated folks experienced
  in tech start-ups and thrive in fast-paced environments.
  Could you be our next hire?
  
  This candidate will join a well-funded, fast-growing
  technology startup with the unique opportunity to help build
  out a critical function for the company.
  
  We’re now entering our next phase: evolving BuildOps from a
  System of Record into a System of Action—software that
  doesn’t just store data, but actively drives decisions,
  automates workflows, and orchestrates work in real time
  using AI. You will define and lead BuildOps’ AI product
  strategy, translating customer workflows, operational data,
  and emerging AI capabilities into actionable, outcome-driven
  product experiences. This is a highly visible, high-impact
  role working across Product, Engineering, Data, and Go-To-
  Market to ensure AI moves beyond features and becomes a core
  operating layer of the platform.
  
  What You'll Do:Lead the System of Action UI Vision:
  
  - Define and evolve the front-end architecture for AI-driven
    product experiences across multiple modules & experiences
  - Establish a cohesive interaction model for “AI as an
    operating layer” across the platform (not isolated
    features)
  - Set the technical bar for polished, intuitive, workflow-
    native AI interactions
  
  Build Novel AI Interfaces for OpsAI:
  
  - Ship high-quality AI interface patterns, such as:
  - Translate ambiguous product concepts into concrete UI
    primitives and reusable components
  
  Engineer for Trust, Transparency, & Control:
  
  - Build interfaces that help users understand why the system
    is suggesting something, what will happen if they accept
    it, and how to undo or override
  - Implement guardrails and safe-action patterns for semi-
    autonomous workflows
  - Create clear UX for AI quality signals (freshness,
    uncertainty, source references, fallbacks)
  
  Drive Front End Technical Strategy & Quality:
  
  - Own key UI technical decisions: state management, data
    loading patterns, performance budgets, accessibility,
    observability, and testing strategy for AI workflows
  - Improve developer velocity through shared patterns,
    component libraries, and strong engineering standards
  - Ensure AI-driven UI remains responsive and robust under
    real-world conditions (large datasets, slow networks,
    heavy concurrency)
  
  Cross-Functional Leadership:
  
  - Partner with Design to create intuitive, high-leverage
    interaction patterns (especially for “human-in-the-loop”)
  - Collaborate with backend/ML teams to define API contracts,
    streaming/async interaction models, and reliability
    behaviors
  - Work with Product to define measurable outcomes and iterate
    based on customer feedback and usage telemetry
  
  Measure Impact:
  
  - Define and instrument UX and product metrics tied to OpsAI
    success (e.g., time saved, reduced errors, throughput
    improvements, feature adoption, workflow completion rates)
  - Use data and customer feedback to continuously refine the UX
    and interaction model
  
  What We Look For:
  
  - 8+ years building front-end applications, including
    leadership on complex, cross-team initiatives
  - Deep expertise in modern front-end engineering (component
    architecture, performance, testing, accessibility, design
    systems)
  - Proven ability to deliver 0→1 product experiences and evolve
    them into scalable platform capabilities
  - Experience building UI for data-heavy, workflow-heavy,
    operational software (construction, field service,
    logistics, manufacturing, etc. preferred)
  - Strong product intuition and a track record of collaborating
    with design and PM to shape solutions
  - Experience with building alongside Copilot, Claude Code, etc
  - Experience with AI/LLM-powered UX patterns (or comparable
    systems with probabilistic outputs) and comfort designing
    for uncertainty
  - Experience with real-time UI patterns (streaming responses,
    background job status, optimistic updates)
  - Experience designing/engineering auditability for automated
    actions (history, attribution, rollback)
  - Familiarity with experimentation frameworks, analytics, and
    UX measurement for iterative product development
  - Ability to lead through influence: aligning engineers,
    designers, and product stakeholders around a coherent
    technical direction
  - Clear communicator who can explain technical tradeoffs in
    practical, customer-centered terms
  
  Compensation
  
  - $196,000 - $272,000 base salary range + annual bonus

  - Generous equity grant, become an owner in our company!
  - Macbook computer provided
  - A comprehensive benefits package
  - Flexible PTO and hybrid work schedules
  - Work from home stipend
  - Hubs in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto, and Raleigh
