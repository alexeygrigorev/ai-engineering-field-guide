  - Partner with engineers, product designers, and product owners to build AI-first experiences across the digital workplace.
  
  - Take operational ownership of the components and services you develop.
  
  - Contribute to knowledge sharing and internal up skilling in AI fluency across IT teams.
  
  **Who You Are **
  
  - Skilled in designing, building, testing, debugging, and optimizing agentic systems or workflows.
  
  - Experienced in delivering end-to-end solutions, with strong understanding of software architecture across back-end, front-end, and the APIs that connect them.
  
  - Proficient in Java for backend services and experienced with JavaScript/React for front-end interfaces, enabling you to work effectively across the full stack.
  
  - Passionate about experimentation, iteration, and continuous learning in a collaborative engineering environment.
  
  - Comfortable navigating ambiguity and driving clarity in complex technical spaces.
  
  **Where You'll Be **
  
  - This role is based in London
  
  - We offer you the flexibility to work where you work best! There will be some in person meetings, but still allows for flexibility to work from home.
