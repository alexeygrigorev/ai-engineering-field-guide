  THE JOB / Data Engineer (AI Enablement)
  
  STRATEGY / Responsible for building and operating the data
  foundations that power Octagon’s AI solutions and enterprise
  search.
  
   ***Our headquarters are in Stamford, CT, but the location
  of this position can be 100% remote for qualified
  candidates.
  
  You’re a systems-minded builder who turns messy, multi-
  source data into reliable, searchable, and governed
  knowledge. Your mission is to stand up the pipelines, vector
  search, and metadata standards that make AI tools accurate,
  fast, and safe. You’ll partner closely with the Solutions
  Engineer (peer role) to take prototypes and ship durable
  infrastructure—ingestion, embeddings, indexing, and APIs—so
  teams can find and use what they need. You’ll report to the
  Director, Data Strategy and work across departments to
  reduce manual effort, improve data quality, and enable AI-
  powered workflows at scale.
  
   THE WORK YOU’LL DO
  
  - Data foundations: Design and operate the vector
    database/search layer (e.g., FAISS/pgvector/Milvus) and
    document-chunking/embedding pipelines that make Octagon’s
    content discoverable and auditable.
  - Scalable pipelines for AI/ML/LLM: Implement and maintain
    ELT/ETL to support downstream workflows such as data
    labeling, classification, and document parsing; build
    robust validations, lineage, and observability.
  - Retrieval APIs: Expose governed retrieval endpoints that
    respect permissions (ACLs), support metadata filters, and
    return source snippets/IDs for grounding and citations.
  - Data structuring & manipulation: Normalize, transform, and
    move JSON and other structured payloads cleanly through
    workflows to ensure reliable handoffs and automation
    outputs.
  - Align & collaborate: Align product peers, design, data
    science, engineering, and commercial teams around a
    unified roadmap and shared data contracts.
  - Operationalize prototypes: Take MVPs from the Solutions
    Engineer and productionize with CI/CD, telemetry,
    cost/usage guardrails, and pilot → rollout gating.
  - Reliability & security: Build monitoring (freshness, re-
    index SLAs, retrieval quality), secrets management, access
    controls, and audit logging aligned with enterprise
    governance.
  - Flexibility and willingness to travel and work weekends or
    holidays as needed. Anticipated travel level: Low (0–15%).

    for RAG-style retrieval.
  - Scalable pipeline experience supporting AI/ML/LLM use cases
    (labeling, classification, doc parsing) and partnering
    closely with Data Science and Data Labeling teams.
  - Data structuring & manipulation expertise: cleanly
    normalizing and transforming JSON/Parquet/CSV payloads;
    designing resilient data contracts and schemas.
  - Orchestration/ops: Airflow/Prefect (or similar), CI/CD,
