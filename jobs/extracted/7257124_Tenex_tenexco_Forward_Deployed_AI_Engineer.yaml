  **Tenex in a sentence**
  
  Tenex helps businesses build their AI strategy, then we make it happen.
  
  **Tenex Engineering is an ai-powered software development agency.** I would never work at a devshop. Neither should you. We’re building something different — a team of the world’s best engineers who want to be paid for what they produce, who want to work on diverse & complex problems, and who want to work alongside the brightest minds in the world.
  
  We’re growing incredibly quickly with clients including startups, established market leaders, new media groups, and more. **Compensation is uncapped and based on output.**
  
  ****Tenex Engineering is not a typical software development agency:****
  - 
  
  **We hire the best** Other agencies make money by hiring cheap talent and charging a premium. We know that one world-class engineer can do more than 10 mediocre engineers, so we only hire the best.
  
  - 
  
  **We use AI** You’d be surprised how many people still type letters, one at a time, into an IDE. We use all the off-the-shelf AI tools and we build our own tools to get an edge.
  
  - 
  
  **We charge on outcomes** We charge our clients based on what we produce, measured by story-points that we define.
  
  - 
  
  **We pay on outcomes** We pay our team based on the story-points that they complete. So everyone is aligned on output and speed. (Psst — comp is uncapped)
  
  **Our Core Values**
  - 
  
  **We give a shit.** We care deeply about all we do. We take pride in our work and are addicted to collecting “Wows” from customers. We sweat the details, see around corners, and are thoughtful in our approach. Excellence isn’t optional—it’s who we are.
  
  - 
  
  **We take out the trash.** No task is beneath us, and no ego is above the work. If something needs doing, we do it—whether or not anyone notices. We do the work to help the team, not to collect personal recognition.
  
  - 
  
  **We never beat around the bush.** Clear communication is kindness. We’re straightforward, open, and timely with our teammates—always direct, always respectful. Nobody should ever have to guess how we feel.
  
  - 
  
  **We go down the rabbit hole. Then keep going.** We constantly seek growth by any means necessary. Curiosity drives us to explore diverse ideas, perspectives, and cultures. "Because we’ve always done it that way" is never an acceptable answer. We actively challenge ourselves and each other to stay inspired, stay curious, and evolve our thinking.
  
  - 
  
  **We do the right thing.** Trust is our most valuable asset—earned slowly, lost instantly. Doing what’s right isn’t negotiable, even when it’s inconvenient, unpopular, or costly. Integrity guides every decision we make, without exception.
  
  - 
  
  **We operate like Navy SEALs.** Greatness doesn’t happen between 9 and 5. We willingly invest nights and weekends—not for optics or politics, but because genuine impact demands commitment. We work hard because our mission deserves nothing less.
  
  - 
  
  **We share feedback. We listen to feedback.** Feedback is our fastest path to excellence. We invite candid critique, meet it with curiosity—not ego—and act on it immediately. Every critique is a chance to level up ourselves and our teammates, so we default to collaboration, assume positive intent, and treat every interaction as a two‑way learning opportunity.
  
  ****What we do****
  
  Our clients include early-stage startups, established market leaders, new media groups, and more. We’re building agentic side-kicks, mobile apps, and whatever else our customers need. **We are growing incredibly quickly**, but cannot disclose much more right now.
  
  ****Must Haves****
  - 
  
  **Elite Engineering Chops:** You ship elegant, scalable code and turn complex problems into streamlined solutions.
  
  - 
  
  **AI-First Mindset:** You leverage AI tools and custom automations to exponentially boost your productivity.
  
  - 
  
  **Relentless Curiosity:** You proactively explore new tech, continuously sharpen your skills, and bring cutting-edge insights back to the team.
  
  - 
  
  **Team Multiplier:** You elevate everyone around you through mentorship, clear communication, and proactive collaboration.
  
  ****Compensation + Benefits****
  
  **Compensation is based on output, uncapped.** Earn between $250,000 and $800,000 (or more) annually, directly tied to the story-points you deliver.
