  **____________________________________________________________________________________** 
  
  **Job Summary:** 
  
  We are seeking a Full Stack Software Engineer to build the frontend and backend of the Agentic Computational Engineering platform. In this role, you will create high-performance full stack web applications that allow engineers to steer AI agents, visualize complex physics and CAD data, and collaborate with AI agents in real time.
  
  You will work across the stack, with an emphasis on performance, 3D visualization, and intuitive UX for technical users. This role is ideal for someone who loves building tools for other engineers and who wants to make the reasoning and actions of AI systems transparent.
  
  You will be joining the Agentic Computational Engineering (ACE) team, a specialized group within our Advanced Technology Development organization. ACE is responsible for building Voyager’s Generative Engine – the AI-native platform that compresses complex hardware development cycles from years to days. We design agentic AI systems that pair deeply with physics simulation, test data, and modern manufacturing so that Design for Manufacturing (DfM), Design for Assembly (DfA), and Design for Test (DfT) are built into the very first line of code and the very first sketch of a design.
  
  **Responsibilities:** 
  
  - Design and build web applications that serve as mission control for ACE, with a focus on responsiveness and usability for expert users.
  
  - Implement high-fidelity 2D/3D visualizations (e.g., CAD models, PCB layouts, CFD fields) using technologies such as Three.js, WebGL, or WebGPU.
  
  - Create features that expose agent reasoning, tool usage, and design history in transparent and intuitive ways for engineers.
  
  - Develop real-time, collaborative editing and review workflows (e.g., via WebSockets, CRDTs) for human-AI co-design.
  
  - Collaborate with backend, platform, and domain team members to design APIs and data contracts that power the UI.
  
  - Manage agentic teams of LLMs to scaffold components, generate documentation, and accelerate development.
  
  **Required Qualifications:**  
  
  - An ability to define design decisions and build rapidly in a scalable way.
  
  - 1–5 years of experience as a full-stack or frontend-focused software engineer (exceptional new graduates encouraged to apply with a strong portfolio).
  
  - Experience with modern web frameworks such as React and Next.js, and with state management for complex applications.
  
  - Strong understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript, HTTP APIs, and browser performance optimization.
  
  - Exposure to 3D graphics or data visualization on the web (WebGL/WebGPU/Three.js or similar) through professional work, coursework, or personal projects.
  
  - Demonstrated habit of using AI tools to accelerate implementation, styling, and documentation.
  
  **Preferred Qualifications:**  
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Mathematics or a related field; or equivalent experience.
  
  - Experience building software tools for engineers, scientists, or technical operations teams.
  
  - Portfolio of creative coding, generative art, or game development projects.
  
  - Familiarity with design systems and UX best practices for technical users.
  
  - Deep passion for automation.
  
  Voyager offers a comprehensive, total compensation package, which includes competitive salary, a discretionary annual bonus plan, paid time off (PTO), a comprehensive health benefit package, retirement savings, wellness program, and various other benefits. When you join our team, you’re not just an employee; you become part of a dynamic community dedicated to innovation and excellence. 
  
  To conform to U.S. Government space technology export regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) you must be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident of the U.S., protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3), or eligible to obtain the required authorizations from the U.S. Department of State.
