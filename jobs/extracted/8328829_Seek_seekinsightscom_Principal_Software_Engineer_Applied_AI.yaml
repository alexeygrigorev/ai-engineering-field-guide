  At Seek, we’re building the first-ever marketplace for data apps—where providers and consumers connect to drive real business impact fast. Insight Cloud isn’t just another BI tool; it’s a platform built from the ground up for the secure exchange of complete, production-ready data applications.
  
  We're hiring a **Principal Software Engineer, Applied AI** who will serve as a technical leader in bringing cutting-edge AI into production at scale. This role goes beyond coding features. You'll shape technical direction, set patterns for integrating AI into cloud-native applications, and mentor others to deliver robust, human-centered AI experiences. You'll work across the stack while also ensuring our AI capabilities (like conversational querying, guided workflows, and intelligent recommendations) are implemented with reliability, security, and long-term scalability. 
  ****In this role you will get to:****
  - 
  
  Build full stack features using React, Python, and modern APIs to deliver high-quality user experiences 
  
  - 
  
  Design and extend backend services and APIs that integrate AI models and external AI services into the platform 
  
  - 
  
  Create intuitive user workflows that incorporate AI (e.g., conversational data querying, assisted discovery, or guided analytics) 
  
  - 
  
  Integrate with Snowflake and our semantic modeling layer to deliver seamless data-driven applications 
  
  - 
  
  Define patterns and best practices for integrating LLMs and semantic modeling into data workflows 
  
  - 
  
  Mentor and guide engineers, raising the bar on engineering craft, AI integration strategies, and system reliability 
  
  - 
  
  Shape the app marketplace experience by advancing intelligent recommendations, AI-assisted publishing, and cross-app insights 
  
  - 
  
  Ensure reliability at scale by driving observability, automated testing, CI/CD improvements, and performance tuning across AI-enabled systems 
  
  - 
  
  Partner with product and design leadership to translate ambiguous AI opportunities into customer-ready features 
  
  - 
  
  Evaluate and influence technology choices (agent frameworks, Snowflake integrations, orchestration layers) 
  
  ****We’re excited about you because you have:****
  - 
  
  9+ years of full stack development experience with strong proficiency in React and Python
  
  - 
  
  Proven track record building and shipping production-grade web applications (SaaS or data platforms a plus)
  
  - 
  
  Deep expertise in system architecture, distributed systems, and API design
  
  - 
  
  Familiarity with AI/ML integration (using APIs, SDKs, or model endpoints) in production software
  
  - 
  
  Strong ability to debug complex systems end-to-end across frontend, backend, and data layers
  
  - 
  
  Demonstrated experience as a technical mentor or team lead driving engineering quality and scaling teams
  
  - 
  
  Excellent communicator who can bridge technical and business perspectives in cross-functional teams
  
  ****Bonus points if you have:****
  - 
  
  Hands-on experience integrating LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines into apps
  
  - 
  
  Knowledge of agent frameworks or intelligent assistant patterns
  
  - 
  
  Familiarity with Snowflake or other cloud data warehouses
  
  - 
  
  Recognized as a go-to problem solver or thought leader in AI product integration or full stack engineering
  
  - 
  
  Startup experience—comfortable moving quickly and wearing multiple hats**
