  future of AI-powered teamwork. What you'll do As a Principal
  Forward Deployed Engineer, you will:
  
  - Lead the design, development, and deployment of AI/ML-
    powered solutions tailored to customer needs, leveraging
    frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and agent-based
    platforms (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex).
  - Architect and implement robust application integrations
    using Python, JavaScript, or similar languages, with a
    focus on APIs, microservices, and enterprise-scale
    systems.
  - Drive data-driven solution development by analyzing complex
    datasets to extract insights and inform product direction.
  - Champion the adoption of AI-augmented workflow automation
    within customer environments, maximizing business value
    and operational efficiency.
  - Oversee the end-to-end deployment of AI solutions into
    production, ensuring continuous evaluation, monitoring,
    and improvement.
  - Navigate risk and compliance requirements, including AI risk
    assessment, data privacy (GDPR), and regulatory
    frameworks.
  - Mentor and guide junior engineers, fostering a culture of
    innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning.
  - Communicate complex technical concepts clearly to both
    technical and non-technical stakeholders, creating concise
    artifacts for peers, partners, and leadership.
  - Align technical solutions with business objectives, setting
    a clear vision for technological progress and measurable
    results.
  
  Your background On the first day, we'll expect you to have:
  
  - Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science,
    Engineering, Data Science, or a related field.
  - 10+ years of experience in backend software development.
  - 5+ years of experience delivering impactful AI/ML solutions
    in production environments, including experience as a
    founding or forward-deployed engineer in 0-to-1 product
    development.
  - Deep expertise in applied AI/ML, including generative AI,
    LLMs, and agent-based frameworks.
  - Proficiency in Python, JavaScript, or similar languages, and
    experience with APIs, microservices, and enterprise
    integration.
  - Demonstrated ability to solve complex, ambiguous problems
    and thrive in rapidly changing environments.
