  **Interview Process******Step 1: Intro call with our Head of Engineering (or a team member)****
  
  This is a two-way conversation. We’ll talk about your background, what you’re looking for next, and the kinds of problems you enjoy solving. You’ll also get a chance to learn more about Column — how we work, what we value, and how we’d support you if you joined. Bring questions!
  
  ****Step 2: Take home challenge****
  
  We’ll ask you to complete a ~3-hour project that mirrors the kind of integration or tooling work we do every day. You’ll have full freedom to do it your way — this is about decision-making, clarity, and implementation, not code golf.
  
  ****Step 3: Interview panels****
  
  The interview panels are where you’ll meet several of us and work through collaborative challenges. The interviews are designed to mimic real work — like redesigning a creaky system, debugging in a sandboxed environment, and walking through a past project. The interview panels are over video calls and ~4.5 hours total over two days. 
  
  ****Step 4: Offer****
  
  Before making a formal offer, we like to speak with a few people you’ve worked closely with — usually a manager or peer. It helps us understand how to support you best. If all looks good, we’ll move quickly to extend an offer and kick off what we hope is a long, rewarding partnership.
  
  ****How to apply****
  
  At Column Tax, we’re committed to building a diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplace. If this sounds exciting — even if you’re not sure you meet every requirement — we hope you’ll apply. We’re looking for people, not checkboxes.
