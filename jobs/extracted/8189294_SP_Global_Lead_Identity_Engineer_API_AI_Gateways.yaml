  Position Summary:
  
  We are seeking a Lead Identity Engineer to lead the
  architecture of our next-generation API security and
  authorization platforms. While deeply rooted in core IAM

  securing APIs and modern authorization standards
  (OAuth/OIDC) to architect the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
  Gateway, the secure bridge connecting our enterprise data to
  AI agents. In this role, you will primarily focus on
  building robust Authorization frameworks and API Governance
  layers that can scale to support not just human users, but
  the high-velocity, complex access patterns of AI agents.

  posture by extending our robust API security controls to the
  emerging AI ecosystem. In this role, responsibilities
  include architecting and governing the MCP Gateway. You will
  ensure that critical data sources are protected against
  unauthorized AI access. By implementing Fine-Grained
  Authorization (FGA) and context-aware policies, you will
  enable the safe adoption of Generative AI, ensuring that our
  digital supply chain remains secure, compliant, and ready
  for the future of automation.

    Java or Python. You must be comfortable writing high-
    performance APIs and micro-services.
  - MCP & AI Readiness: Strong theoretical or practical
    knowledge of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
