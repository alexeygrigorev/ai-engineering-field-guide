  Role Description: Enterprise AI Engineer .
  
  *Principals only. No recruiters.
  
  Role Purpose:
  
  Wasabi is seeking an AI Engineer to help build and scale our
  Enterprise AI Platform.  This platform will be the
  foundation that enables AI assistants, agents, and AI-
  powered applications across Wasabi’s business functions. In
  this role, you’ll be a hands-on engineer who can translate
  business needs into concrete AI solution designs, implement
  core platform and application components, and drive
  solutions into production with measurable impact.
  
  You’ll operate at the intersection of AI innovation,
  software engineering, and business operations.  You will
  partner closely with stakeholders across Sales, Marketing,
  Finance, HR, Legal, Customer Support, and IT to deliver
  secure, reliable, and scalable AI capabilities that elevate
  productivity and decision-making across the company.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
    - Design and implement AI-powered solutions (assistants,
      agents, and apps) that solve business problems across
      enterprise functions.
    - Build platform capabilities for modern AI workloads,
      including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), agent
      orchestration, evaluation, and production inference
      services.
    - Implement scalable services that support low-latency, high-
      throughput AI applications, while meeting reliability,
      security, and cost objectives.
    - Develop reusable patterns, libraries, and best practices
      that enable teams to safely and efficiently build on the
      Enterprise AI Platform.
    - Support rapid experimentation (POCs), evaluate emerging AI
      tools/frameworks, and help evolve platform architecture
      to incorporate successful innovations into production.
    - Contribute to MLOps pipelines (training, fine-tuning,
      versioning, deployment, monitoring, drift detection) to
      streamline the model lifecycle.
    - Help define and implement automated testing strategies for
      AI solutions (quality, safety, regression, hallucination
      checks, latency, and robustness).
    - Partner with Data/Analytics, Security, IT, and Engineering
      teams to ensure strong data governance, privacy
      protections, and responsible AI practices.
    - Contribute to team engineering excellence through code
      reviews, documentation, and knowledge-sharing.
  
  Requirements:
  
    - 5+ years of experience in software engineering or applied
      AI/ML engineering, with experience building production
      services.
    - Demonstrated ability to design and deliver AI/ML-powered
      applications and/or platform capabilities in real-world
      environments.
    - Solid understanding of core AI concepts and modern
      Generative AI patterns (RAG, prompt engineering,
      evaluation, agentic workflows).
    - Experience with the AI lifecycle: data pipelines,
      training/fine-tuning (where applicable), evaluation,
      deployment, and monitoring.
    - Proficiency in one or more of: Python, Go, Java, or similar
      languages with strong fundamentals in APIs, reliability,
      observability, and performance.
    - Experience with modern AI/ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch,
      TensorFlow, JAX) and cloud AI/ML platforms (AWS, GCP,
      Azure).
    - Strong communication skills and the ability to work
      effectively with technical and non-technical
      stakeholders.
  
  Nice to have:
  
    - BS in CS/ML or related field, or equivalent practical
      experience.
    - Experience with security and privacy controls for AI systems
      (PII handling, access control, guardrails,
      auditability).
    - Experience working with distributed systems and large-scale
      data platforms. Base Salary – $160,000 - $200,000
