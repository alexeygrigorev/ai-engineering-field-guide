  - 
  
  Design scalable, intuitive database schemas and data models that underpin the platform.
  
  -

  - 
  
  Drive technical strategy and make long-term architectural decisions.
  
  - 
  
  Proactively identify opportunities to improve system reliability, observability, and performance.

  - 
  
  8+ years of professional software engineering experience, with substantial time in senior or staff-level roles.
  
  - 
  
  Deep expertise in one or more backend programming languages; experience with functional programming is a plus.
  
  - 
  
  Proven experience designing and scaling distributed systems in a production environment.
  
  - 
  
  Solid understanding of relational and non-relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis) and data architecture.
  
  - 
  
  Proven experience improving system reliability, observability, and performance in production environments.
  
  - 
  
  Experience collaborating with DevOps teams on deployment, monitoring, and cloud infrastructure.
  
  - 
  
  Excellent collaboration and communication skills — you bring others along and elevate those around you.
  
  - 
  
  Product-oriented mindset — you care deeply about building systems that meet real user needs.
  
  - 
  
  Experience mentoring engineers and leading technical projects or cross-team initiatives.
  
  **Nice to Have**
  
  - 
  
  Experience working in a fast-growing startup environment.
  
  - 
  
  Contributions to open source or active participation in engineering communities.
  
  - 
  
  Experience building and supporting LLM-powered applications in production.
