  About Ethos
  
  Ethos was built to make it faster and easier to get life
  insurance for the next million families. Our approach blends
  industry expertise, technology, and the human touch to find
  you the right policy to protect your loved ones.
  
  We leverage deep technology and data science to streamline
  the life insurance process, making it more accessible and
  convenient. Using predictive analytics, we are able to
  transform a traditionally multi-week process into a modern
  digital experience for our users that can take just minutes!
  We’ve issued billions in coverage each month and eliminated
  the traditional barriers, ushering the industry into the
  modern age. Our full-stack technology platform is the
  backbone of family financial health.
  
  We make getting life insurance easier, faster and better for
  everyone.
  
  Our investors include General Catalyst, Sequoia Capital,
  Accel Partners, Google Ventures, SoftBank, and the
  investment vehicles of Jay-Z, Kevin Durant, Robert Downey Jr
  and others. This year, we were named on CB Insights' Global
  Insurtech 50 list and BuiltIn's Top 100 Midsize Companies in
  San Francisco. We are scaling quickly and looking for
  passionate people to protect the next million families!
  
  About the Role
  
  We’re building several LLM-powered copilots across critical
  workflows (e.g., underwriting productivity, agent
  enablement, customer support, operations/compliance, fraud).
  We need an AI engineer to own the LLM + retrieval + context
  layer that makes these copilots accurate, auditable, fast,
  and cost-efficient.
  
  Typical stack: Python/FastAPI, Postgres + vector
  (pgvector/Pinecone/Weaviate), OpenSearch, optional graph DB,
  Kubernetes + GPUs, OTEL/Datadog
  
  Duties and Responsibilities:
  
  - Production RAG: indexing, retrieval, hybrid search,
    reranking, query rewriting, grounding, citations
  - Context Graph: entity resolution + linking + provenance;
    graph + vector retrieval; supports multi-hop context
  - LLM orchestration: tool/function calling, structured
    outputs, routing across model tiers, failure modes
  - GPU/inference cost optimization: batching, caching/KV reuse,
    quantization, autoscaling; optimize $/session + latency
  - Safety + compliance: PII/PHI handling, redaction, audit
    logs, deterministic replay, hallucination mitigation
  - LLMOps: eval harness (golden sets, regression, adversarial),
    monitoring for quality/cost/drift
  - Design/ship the end-to-end pipeline: retrieve → assemble
    context → generate → cite → log/monitor
  - Improve quality and trust via evaluation, feedback loops,
    and clear evidence-backed outputs
  - Partner with product, security, and domain teams; write
    crisp design docs; raise engineering bar
  - Ship RAG v1 with citations + measurable quality metrics
  - Deliver Context Graph v1 that improves retrieval on real
    copilot tasks
  - Reduce cost/latency with a concrete inference optimization
    plan shipped to prod
  
  Qualifications and Skills:
  
  - 7+ years building production systems; 2+ years hands-on
    LLMs/RAG
  - Proven RAG experience (embeddings, vector DBs, hybrid
    search, reranking, eval)
  - Strong backend/distributed systems + observability
  - Track record shipping in high-stakes environments with
    auditability/correctness
  - Knowledge graph / entity resolution / provenance systems
  - GPU inference optimization (vLLM/TGI/TensorRT-LLM,
    quantization AWQ/GPTQ, batching)
  - Regulated domain experience (insurance/fintech/healthcare)
