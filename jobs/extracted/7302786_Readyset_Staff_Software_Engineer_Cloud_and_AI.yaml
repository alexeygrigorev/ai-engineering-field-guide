  About Readyset
  
  At Readyset, we are building a database cache with zero
  integration cost - just swap your connection string and take
  read latencies from ~100's of ms to under a ms while
  reducing costs. It precomputes the results of prepared
  statements (i.e. parameterized SQL queries) and
  incrementally updates these results over time as the
  underlying data in your database changes.
  
  Readyset is wire-compatible with MySQL and Postgres, so it
  can be integrated with your existing application without
  code or database changes– Readyset makes it easy for
  developers to build performant web, analytical, and internal
  applications regardless of whether they’re deployed to a
  single region or around the world.
  
  We’re looking for people who are excited about exploring and
  productionizing the frontier of distributed systems and DB
  research to join our fully-remote team. You’d be a great fit
  at Readyset if you're excited about bringing to market data
  infrastructure that makes applications faster, simpler, and
  easier to deploy.
  
  About this role
  
  We’re looking for a Staff Software Engineer to help build
  the next generation of AI-native cloud infrastructure:
  systems that power data-intensive products and bring
  advanced AI capabilities into production. Our Cloud and AI
  team moves fast and delivers what others call impossible,
  shipping ambitious systems at breakneck speed while
  maintaining engineering rigor.
  
  The challenges we’re tackling are the ones that define
  enterprise-scale AI systems:
  
  - Freshness: ensuring data is always current, since stale
    results immediately erode user trust.
  - Memory: designing structured, retrievable memory so agents
    can behave reliably over time, not just like short-lived
    chatbots.
  - Cost: keeping re-embedding, reranker passes, and LLM calls
    sustainable through batching, caching, and smart model
    routing.
  
  We believe solving these challenges is key to making AI
  systems production-grade: responsive, reliable, and
  affordable at scale. As a Staff Engineer, you’ll play a
  central role in designing and operating the infrastructure
  that makes this possible.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Design and own critical services: hands-on development of
    systems that are robust, scalable, and simple to operate
    in production.
  - Lead high-impact architectural decisions, balancing speed
    with sound engineering for 3–4 9s availability.
  - Work across the stack, from distributed cloud infrastructure
    to AI-driven features like retrieval, memory, and agent
    orchestration.
  - Collaborate with leadership and product teams to translate
    ambitious ideas into reality, fast.
  - Act as a technical leader: mentor engineers, drive
    engineering culture, and shape the way we build as we
    scale.
  - Contribute to Readyset’s engineering strategy and vision,
    not just individual projects
  
  You may be a good fit if you have…
  
  - 10+ years of software engineering experience, ideally with
    exposure to databases, data platforms, or large-scale
    systems.
  - Proven ability to design and run cloud services at scale
    with high availability (3–4 9s).
  - Experience with AI/ML systems or integrating LLMs into
    production (retrieval pipelines, memory systems, agent
    frameworks).
  - Expert backend development experience in Python, Golang,
    Java, Rust etc.; familiarity with modern frontend
    frameworks a plus.
  - Deep familiarity with AWS (experience with GCP/Azure a
    plus).
  - Demonstrated technical leadership: shaping architecture,
    influencing design, and guiding teams through complexity.
  - A mindset for velocity with rigor: moving fast without
    compromising sound engineering
  
  Why Readyset
  
  At Readyset, you’ll join a high-caliber team of engineers
  who have repeatedly built and shipped complex systems at
  extraordinary speed. We are now adapting our proven database
  performance technology to address the next generation of AI
  infrastructure. This is an opportunity to help build one of
  the next foundational companies in AI and data
  infrastructure, with the resources and runway to match.
  We’ve raised over $28M from top-tier investors to power our
  growth. As a staff engineer, you won’t just execute; you’ll
  set direction, shape architecture.
  
  Compensation
  
  The salary range for this role is $190,000-240,000 USD per
  year. This salary range may include multiple levels. Your
  level is based on our assessment of your interview
  performance and experience, which you can always ask the
  hiring manager about to understand in more detail.  In
  addition to salary, you’ll receive meaningful equity, giving
  you real ownership in the company’s growth and success.
  
  Health & Wellness
  
  We offer top-tier medical, dental, and vision coverage. Our
  plans are designed with flexibility in mind, so you can
  choose the coverage that best fits your needs.
  
  PTO & Parental Leave
  
  We offer unlimited PTO with minimum vacation recommendations
  and encourage our team members to take time off whenever
  they need it. We also offer 90 days of paid parental leave.
  #LI-Remote
  
  Our Values Continuous Learning and Growth
  
  Having a product rooted in research out of MIT, a commitment
  to learning is a requisite trait of every team member. We
  work on cutting-edge problems in distributed systems and are
  looking for engineers ready to rise to the challenge as we
  revolutionize the use of SQL in modern web applications. We
  want to be a company where all employees are excited to
  continue learning and growing in their area of expertise, no
  matter which role or team they are a part of.
  
  Healthy Collaboration
  
  Though every team member at Readyset is individually
  exceptional, many of the problems we are solving have not
  been solved before. This means engineering at Readyset is a
  team sport.  We strive to give every engineer ownership over
  their work while giving them the resources they need to
  produce high-quality solutions. We welcome feedback on our
  own ideas and create timelines with the assumption that part
  of every day will be spent helping others. We also trust
  that during disagreements, every teammate will prioritize
  finding the best possible solution over being right. We
  encourage collaboration and humility over ego.
  
  Safety to Fail
  
  As a growth stage company tackling huge engineering
  challenges, sometimes we fail. When this happens, we don’t
  place blame or keep score and are willing to acknowledge
  when we could have done better. Most importantly, we are
  committed to learning and improving as much as possible from
  every failure so we have a higher chance of succeeding the
  next time.
  
  Diversity and Inclusion
  
  ReadySet knows that a diverse workforce directly contributes
  to a higher quality product for our customers. We have put
  immense effort into fostering an inclusive, diverse work
  environment from the time of the company’s founding. We
  expect everyone to bring empathy and respect to all of their
  interactions with coworkers and customers. Encouraging
  everyone to bring their unique perspectives to the table
  when solving problems helps us build and deliver stronger
  products.
