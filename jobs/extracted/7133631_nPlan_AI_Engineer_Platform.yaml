  Join nPlan — where AI meets the future of construction
  
  We’re nPlan, a Series B startup backed by leading investors,
  including GV (formerly Google Ventures) and DeepMind’s
  founder, Demis Hassabis. Our technology helps the world’s
  biggest construction projects make faster, more confident,
  data-driven decisions.
  
  By combining one of the world’s largest datasets of project
  plans with advanced machine learning, we forecast project
  outcomes and reduce risk — reshaping how infrastructure gets
  built.
  
  We work with complex graph data (each with 10,000+ nodes),
  applying multiple ML and LLM approaches to understanding the
  data, extracting meaningful insights from it using a
  proprietary forecasting engine, and empowering deep human
  interactions - all of which must work efficiently and
  robustly in production.  As a startup, we also keep agile in
  a fast-moving environment!
  
  The Role
  
  We are looking for an AI Engineer (Platform) to join our
  Engineering team. You’ll drive the design and implementation
  of AI features across our product set, taking ideas from
  inception to release - working with the Product organisation
  as fellow product and research engineers.
  
  This role is ideal for someone who thrives on technical
  depth, intellectual challenge, and impact at scale. You’ll
  work alongside top engineers, machine learning specialists,
  and AI experts, shaping the future of project intelligence.
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  We’re after specialists who bring both expertise and
  curiosity.
  
  For this role, we are looking for someone who:
  
  - Keeps up to date with the latest developments in AI and
    loves to experiment with new models
  - Has shipped LLM and generative AI-based applications to
    production
  - Is really comfortable working with Python, building APIs,
    with cloud-based backends
  - Thrives when things are initially ambiguous, finding a path
    towards certainty
  - Has strong communication and collaboration skills
  - Please mention the word ‘crane’ in your application form
  
  We care more about potential and drive than perfection. If
  you’re excited by what we’re building, we want to hear from
  you. If you understand the nuances of agentic frameworks,
  eval frameworks and/or the causes of hallucination, you’ll
  feel right at home here.
  
  Why You’ll Love Working Here
  
  - Competitive salary of £70,000-£100,000 and generous equity —
    when nPlan succeeds, so do you.
  - Flexible hours, so long as you can do our core hours of
    11am-3pm (UK timezone), Mon-Fri, we’re happy. You can also
    work remotely, or at our Shoreditch office HQ.
  - Uncapped holiday, private medical insurance, personal
    learning and development budget, enhanced family and sick
    leave, and more.
  - Room to grow — we’re approaching 50 people and scaling fast.
  - Guided by our values: Learn from Everything. Be Radically
    Truthful. Aim High, Run Fast.
  
  Our Culture
  
  We’re a curious, diverse, and mission-driven team united by
  a belief that better data can change how the world builds.
  We value openness, honesty, and diversity of thought — and
  believe the best ideas win, no matter where they come from.
  
  Expect openness, collaboration, and balance — plus socials
  and offsites, of course!
  
  Application Process
  
  - Once you’ve applied, you will hear from us within a week.
  - Interview stages typically include:
    - A 30-minute intro chat
    - A deep-dive technical or domain interview
    - An interview focusing on our culture and values
    - A final stage to test collaboration with our team (on-site
      or remote)
  - We aim to complete the process within 3–4 weeks but can move
    faster if necessary.
  
  We want every candidate to have a positive experience — and
  we’ll keep you informed every step of the way.
  
  Accessibility & Inclusion
  
  We’re committed to building a diverse and inclusive
  workplace and we welcome applicants from all backgrounds. If
  you need adjustments during the hiring process, please let
  us know.
