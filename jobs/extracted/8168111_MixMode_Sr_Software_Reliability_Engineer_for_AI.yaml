  Job Title: Senior Software Reliability Engineer for AI
  
  Location: Santa Barbara, CA or Remote 
  **Job Summary: **
  
  We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer to improve the reliability, performance, and scalability of our production AI systems. This role focuses on understanding, refining, and strengthening existing distributed services across application, database, and Kubernetes layers. This individual will work closely with ML researchers to make our systems more robust, maintainable, flexible, and scalable.
  
  **Responsibilities:**
  
  - Own the reliability, performance, and operational health of production AI systems, focusing on improving complex, existing services. 
  
  - Lead efforts to refactor and harden the AI codebase to improve observability, maintainability, and resilience. 
  
  - Diagnose and resolve issues across distributed systems, including latency, throughput, data pipelines, and resource utilization. 
  
  - Design and build monitoring, alerting, and debugging tools for high-availability services. 
  
  - Partner with researchers and ML engineers to productionize models at scale. 
  
  - Establish best practices for testing, deployment, capacity planning, and incident response. 
  
  - Serve as a technical leader during on-call rotations, driving incident response, postmortems, and continuous system improvements.
  
  **Requirements:**
  
  - 7+ years of professional software engineering experience
  
  - Strong proficiency in Python and at least one JVM language (Java, Scala, or Kotlin preferred)
  
  - Proven experience designing, building, and operating distributed systems in production
  
  - Strong understanding of service architecture, concurrency, resource management, and distributed failure modes
  
  - Prior experience with streaming data pipelines (e.g. Spark streaming, Flink, Kafka)
  
  - Hands-on experience running production services on Kubernetes, including pod lifecycle management and fault tolerance.
  
  - Strong experience with relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), including query performance analysis, indexing, and connection management
  
  - Demonstrated ability to diagnose and resolve performance, scalability, and reliability issues across application, database, and infrastructure layers
  
  - Experience implementing automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end) and production observability (logging, metrics, tracing)
  
  - Experience collaborating with ML or data science teams to productionize predictive systems. (Note: ML expertise is *not* required.)
  
  - Ability to improve system architecture and engineering practices over time through design, code review, and mentorship
  
  **Compensation and benefits** are competitive based on industry standards. Benefits for full-time team members include:
  
  - Remote-First Work Culture
  
  - Healthcare (Medical, Dental, Vision, Accident)
  
  - Basic & Voluntary Life and AD&D
