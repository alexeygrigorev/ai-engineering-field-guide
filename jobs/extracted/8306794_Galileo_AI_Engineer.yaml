  About Galileo
  
  Galileo is the leader in agent observability and run-time
  protection. We help AI teams ship reliable AI with evals,
  monitoring, and guardrails that work at production speed. In
  a few years since inception, Galileo has earned the trust of
  Fortune 10 banks, Fortune 50 telecommunications companies,
  as well as AI teams at ServiceTitan, Comcast, NTT, Reddit,
  and Headspace Health. We are backed by top-tier investors,
  have offices in San Francisco and New York, and are growing
  quickly.
  
  We believe AI should empower builders, not slow them down.
  That's why we say Galileo is the fastest way to ship
  reliable AI.
  
  Role Description
  
  We’re looking for customer-facing AI Engineers to educate
  the technical community with hands-on demos & content. As
  part of our Developer Relations team, you’ll create
  technical videos, demos, blogs, and workshops that help
  developers learn to ship reliable AI applications.
  
  We’re looking for an Engineer who loves diving deep into
  code, building compelling demos, and explaining complex
  workflows in ways that make other developers say “got it!”
  You’ll be creating the kind of resources you wish someone
  had made for you.
  
  The ideal candidate combines deep chops in AI/ML with a
  passion for teaching and building. You’ll spend most of your
  time designing and delivering technical content. About 20%
  of your time will go to representing Galileo at events,
  either virtually or in-person.
  
  You’ll also serve as a bridge between our product team and
  the developers who use our platform — synthesizing developer
  feedback into actionable product changes.
  
  This is a chance to join the first 100 Galileans and shape
  the future of agentic AI.
  
  Main Responsibilities
  
  - Build, document, and share sample agents using the latest
    models and frameworks, teaching the community how to build
    reliable AI.
  - Create deep technical posts, videos, and tutorials that
    illustrate practical use cases for developers.
  - Represent Galileo at conferences and virtual events,
    showcasing demos and connecting with developers in
    authentic conversation.
  - Develop and maintain sample code, reference apps, and SDK
    enhancements that help developers get started quickly.
  - Build relationships with AI thought leaders, influencers,
    and open-source communities to strengthen Galileo’s
    community.
  - Partner with product, engineering, and growth teams to
    launch new products & features. Synthesize user feedback
    to shape our roadmap.
  - Stay current with the latest in AI research, LLM models, and
    developer tooling.
  
  What We're Looking For
  
  - 2+ years as a Software Engineer building technical products.
    An active Github profile is a must.
  - Hands-on experience with AI tools, LLMs, agents, and
    frameworks.
  - Proficiency in Python and TypeScript; able to prototype and
    ship small projects quickly.
  - B.S. in Computer Science or equivalent
  - Passion for teaching others how to build.
  - Track record of engaging with developers on social media.
  - Nice-to-have: experience in high-growth startups.

  - Join a seasoned founding team that has previously led
    product and engineering teams from 0 to $100M+ in revenue
    and from 0 to 1B+ users globally
  - We obsess over our team’s culture driven by inclusivity,
