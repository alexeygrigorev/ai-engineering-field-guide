  The Mission
  
  Let's make healthcare free and accessible to everyone
  through AI. We're building an AI doctor that already handles
  millions of consultations - our goal is to scale this to
  billions while maintaining medical safety and accuracy.
  
  What You'll Build
  
  Core AI Systems
  
  - Multi-agent consensus architectures where specialized models
    debate cases before conclusions
  - RAG pipelines processing thousands of clinical guidelines
    built for LLM consumption
  - Fine tuning and model distillation to support efficient
    performance
  - Real-time inference systems handling millions of medical
    consultations each month
  - Custom workflows for domain-specific medical reasoning
  
  Clinical Data Infrastructure
  
  - NLP pipelines extracting structured data from patient
    conversations (HIPAA-compliant)
  - QHIN integrations for automated EHR data retrieval and
    reconciliation
  - Intelligent triage systems routing between AI and human
    providers
  - Documentation generation matching provider-specific
    protocols
  
  Safety & Scale
  
  - Emergency detection with sub-second escalation to human
    oversight
  - Validation layers ensuring 99%+ treatment plan accuracy
  - Distributed systems handling rapid growth and peak loads
  - Fail-safe mechanisms for critical path decisions in
    regulated environments
  
  You'll also work on voice/video AI interfaces, multilingual
  medical NLP, predictive health modeling, and infrastructure
  for the next billion patient interactions.
