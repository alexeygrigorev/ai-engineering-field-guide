  structuring, and optimizing large, diverse healthcare
  datasets. The ideal candidate will have a strong background
  in data engineering principles, experience with big data
  technologies, and a keen understanding of the unique
  challenges and requirements of healthcare data.
  
  You will design, build, and maintain scalable data pipelines
  that source, preprocess, and deliver high-quality, high-
  volume datasets to our machine learning engineers. This role
  requires a deep understanding of data engineering best
  practices coupled with specific knowledge of the data
  requirements for LLM training and refinement
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Collaborate with data scientists and machine learning
    engineers to understand data requirements for LLM and
    machine learning model fine-tuning.
  - Design, build, and maintain scalable data pipelines to
    ingest, process, and store massive and diverse healthcare
    datasets.
  - Implement robust data validation and monitoring to ensure
    the integrity, accuracy, and consistency of all training
    datasets.
  - Implement robust data cleaning, validation, and
    transformation processes to ensure data quality and
    integrity.
  - Develop and optimize data structures and schemas for
    efficient access and utilization by LLMs and machine
    learning models.
  - Work with the team to identify and acquire new data sources,
    ensuring compliance with relevant healthcare regulations
    (e.g., HIPAA).
  - Monitor data pipeline performance, troubleshoot issues, and
    implement optimizations to improve efficiency and
    reliability.
  - Document data engineering processes, data models, and data
    dictionaries.
  - Stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in data
    engineering, big data technologies, and machine learning.
