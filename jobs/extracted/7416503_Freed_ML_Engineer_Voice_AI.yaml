  ABOUT FREED:
  
  Doctors are overworked, burnt out, and are quitting in
  masses.
  
  At Freed, we combine clinician love with the latest AI tech
  and intense execution to create products that make
  clinicians happier.
  
  Our first product is an AI scribe that automates medical
  documentation.
  
  Since May of 2023, we have:
  
  - Acquired 26,000 paying and loving clinicians
  - Generated 100,000 patient notes daily and over 3 million
    monthly
  - Made thousands of clinicians happier
  
  With the backing of Sequoia Capital and other world-class
  VC’s, we are rapidly expanding our product offering.
  Patient-facing assistants, patient insights, EHR
  integrations, and other products are being built and used by
  thousands of clinicians every day.
  
  We are looking for entrepreneurs. Fast, ambitious, and smart
  individuals who want to take care of the people who care for
  our health. Expect intense, clinician-focused, and
  interesting co-workers who want to win.
  
  With an office in San Francisco, we embrace a hybrid
  schedule that brings out the best in teamwork and
  innovation. Our teams come together in person three days a
  week to collaborate, connect, and have a little fun along
  the way.
  
  About the Role:
  
  We're on the hunt for talented, high-caliber individuals to
  join our elite team of engineers. As part of our team,
  you'll play a pivotal role in restoring joy to medicine
  while pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI
  technology. Our engineering culture emphasizes speed, end-
  to-end ownership, responsibility, and independence,
  attracting top-tier talent and promoting exceptional
  performance.
  
  How You’ll Have Impact:
  
  - Evaluate and fine-tune open source speech recognition models
    to provide new capabilities and better quality.
  - Optimize inference infrastructure (WhisperX, Kubernetes,
    NATS) for stability and performance.
  - Since the team is small, it’s likely you’ll have
    opportunities to work with Open Source large language
    models as well.
  
  What You’ll Bring:
  
  - 2+ years working with speech recognition models.
  - 5+ years of Machine Learning or Software experience.
  - A history of consistent top performance and a desire for a
    mission-driven work culture.
  
  Nice to Haves:
  
  - Experience using TypeScript. While our ASR infrastructure is
    Python, the rest of our production infrastructure (LLM
    evaluations, web infrastructure) uses TypeScript.
  - Experience shipping models that power specific products,
    adapting models to feedback from customers or users, and
    analyzing the impact of ML improvements on business
    outcomes.
  - Experience in data preparation and synthetic data
    generation.
  
  What We’ll Bring:
  
  - Competitive salary and equity in a high-growth company
  - Opportunity to make an immediate impact
  - Medical, dental, and vision coverage
  - Unlimited paid time off
  - Company-sponsored annual retreats
  - 401(k) plan to support your long-term financial goals
  - Commuter stipend for our San Francisco based employees
industries:
  - Artificial Intelligence
  - Healthtech
  - Software
