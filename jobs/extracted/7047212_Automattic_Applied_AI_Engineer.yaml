  ## **Applied AI Engineer - New York**
  
  *Location: New York City Innovation Hub (In-person)*
  
  **About This Opportunity**
  
  We're assembling an exceptional team of AI engineers in NYC. The kind of people who’ve shipped breakthrough AI products that millions actually use. This isn’t about office amenities or typical startup perks (although we have those too!). It’s about working alongside some of the most talented engineers and product minds in AI, solving fascinating problems at scale.
  
  You’ll collaborate in-person with a carefully selected group designed for breakthrough thinking, backed by the resources and reach of Automattic’s ecosystem spanning WordPress.com, WooCommerce, Tumblr, and more. Think of it as an elite AI lab with the distribution and impact of Automattic’s ecosystem.
  
  **What You'll Do**
  
  - Ship user-facing AI features across Automattic’s product ecosystem; from content creation tools to e-commerce recommendations to messaging experiences.
  
  - Build and iterate rapidly on AI-powered products that directly impact millions of users.
  
  - Collaborate intensively with PMs, designers, and engineers in a fast-paced environment optimized for innovation.
  
  - Experiment and scale successful AI innovations from prototype to production across multiple products.
  
  - Push the boundaries of what’s possible when exceptional AI talent works together.
  
  - Stay current with AI developments that unlock new user experiences.
  
  **You'll Thrive Here If You**
  
  - Have shipped AI features that users actually use; production experience over theoretical knowledge.
  
  - Are exceptionally talented; you’re the person other great engineers want to work with.
  
  - Are full-stack capable; comfortable from model APIs to user interfaces.
  
  - Move fast without breaking things; prototype quickly while building for scale.
  
  - Work best collaboratively; your best ideas come from working directly with teammates.
  
  - Think product-first; you know great AI is invisible to users; it just makes their experience better.
  
  - Are drawn to working with other exceptional people rather than just seeking comfortable work environments.
  
  **Technical Experience We Value**
  
  - Production experience with LLMs (APIs or custom implementations) at meaningful scale.
  
  - Full-stack development (we use PHP, Python, and JavaScript, primarily).
  
  - Building AI-powered user interfaces that perform well at scale.
  
  - Machine learning fundamentals and staying current with rapid field developments.
  
  - Track record of technical leadership or influence on high-performing teams.
  
  **Bonus Points**
  
  - Developed consumer AI products that scaled to a significant number of users.
  
  - Experience with WordPress, e-commerce, or messaging platforms.
  
  - Open source contributions showing your thinking.
  
  **Why This Role Matters**
  
  Shape how AI transforms products used by hundreds of millions people across the planet. From helping creators tell better stories to enabling merchants compete effectively. You'll tackle fascinating challenges across our entire ecosystem with the backing of a profitable, mission-driven company.
  
  Salary range: $130,000-$250,000 USD 
  
  We are searching for high-caliber candidates with the skills and qualities to have a net positive for Automattic. Pay will reflect the potential contribution and the impact you can bring.
  
  **About Automattic**
  
  Now in our 20th year, we’re  the people behind WordPress.com, WooCommerce, Tumblr, Simplenote, Jetpack, Longreads, Day One, PocketCasts, and more. We believe in making the web a better place.
  
  We’re a distributed company with 1500 Automatticians in nearly every corner of the globe, speaking 110 different languages. Enriched by this diversity, we’re united by a singular mission: to democratize publishing, commerce, and messaging so anyone with a story can tell it, anyone with a product can sell it, and everyone can manage their communications from a single source. In short, we help maintain a balance in society, creating and continually refining powerful tools people can use to compete fairly—regardless of income, gender, politics, language, or where they live in the world.
   
  
  We believe in Open Source, and the vast majority of our work is available under the GPL.
  
  Automattic is a Most Loved Company and Disability Confident Committed. (Here’s what that might mean for you.) Learn more about our dedication to diversity, equity, and inclusion and our Employee Resource Groups.
