  Normal Computing | Incredible Opportunities
  
  The Normal Team builds foundational software and hardware
  that help move technology forward - supporting the
  semiconductor industry, critical AI infrastructure, and the
  broader systems that power our world. We work as one team
  across New York, San Francisco, Copenhagen, Seoul, and
  London.
  
  Your Role in Our Mission:
  
  As a Software Engineer focused on product engineering in
  Normal EDA, you will be responsible for crafting the
  interfaces and workflows used by hardware engineers to build
  and verify the chips that power modern technology. You will
  be architecting and developing the user experiences that
  make AI-assisted semiconductor verification both powerful
  and approachable. You may spend one day interviewing users
  to better understand their needs and identifying product
  gaps to improve. Previous experience with the semiconductor
  or hardware industry is valued, but not required.
  
  You'll regularly be faced with sophisticated technical
  problems at the intersection of AI and product engineering,
  requiring you to scope out solution designs and find
  incremental paths to shipping new features. As part of this,
  you will own APIs and schemas that power your frontend code,
  or work with backend engineers in developing them together.
  
  We're hiring engineers who are passionate about solving
  real-world problems in complex, technical domains and
  building interfaces that empower users to work optimally. If
  you're motivated to develop reliable, performant systems and
  design intuitive experiences for AI-powered workflows, this
  role offers the opportunity to make a significant impact on
  how an entire industry works.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Building complete, integrated prototypes that bring AI
    capabilities to life in production workflows - stitching
    together LLMs, backend services, and polished frontend
    interfaces to create working V0s that users can actually
    test and the ML team can validate.
  - Architecting and developing interactive workflow UIs that
    make complex verification workflows feel approachable.
  - Collaborating closely with product designers to ensure
    pixel-perfect implementation and maintain an exceptionally
    high bar for interface quality and usability.
  - Owning APIs and orchestration patterns that connect
    frontends with ML inference servers and backend services.
  - Partnering with ML researchers, product teams and users to
    translate complex technical requirements into proof-of-
    concept features that integrate AI capabilities seamlessly
    into existing workflows.
  - Driving engineering roadmaps in collaboration with
    researchers, hardware experts, and product managers to
    discover and propose features that drive user stickiness.
  
  What Makes You A Great Fit:
  
  - 5-8 years of frontend software engineering experience, with
    a strong focus on building sophisticated user experiences.
    Experience as a former zero-to-one engineering lead or
    startup founder is highly valued.
  - Strong frontend coding skills used to write clean, effective
    code, with existing proficiency in TypeScript and React
    and deep understanding of modern frontend architecture,
    state management, and how web technologies work.
  - Experience crafting complex user experiences with a strong
    intuition for good design and usability. You avoid the
    failure mode of shipping features quickly without ensuring
    the frontend work is truly excellent.
  - Experience working with LLMs or building AI-powered
    applications. You're excited about understanding the
    nuances of different model paradigms (agents,
    multimodality, simulation methods) and how to design
    product experiences that augment rather than detract from
    user workflows.
  - Proven ability to learn continuously, work independently,
    and make decisions with minimal supervision. You deliver
    on your commitments, value outcomes, and adapt quickly
    when priorities shift.
  - Skill and comfort working in a constantly evolving
    environment with dynamic objectives and iteration with
    users.
  - Experience brainstorming and iterating with product
    designers.
  
  Bonus Points For:
  
  - Experience building IDE extensions, developer tools, or
    design-to-code systems.
  - Meaningful experience working and building within or for the
    semiconductor industry, or developing hardware products or
    software for hardware products.
