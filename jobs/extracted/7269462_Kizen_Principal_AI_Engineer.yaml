  **Los Angeles "Near UCLA" | Hybrid (Minimum 4 days in office)  |  Full Time  |  https://kizen.com****About Us**
  
  At Kizen, we build technology that makes AI actually work for people.
  
  Our platform helps organizations automate the workflows that matter most — from helping insurance agents manage contracting and commissions, to enabling healthcare providers to deliver proactive patient care, to empowering financial institutions to classify documents and extract data automatically.
  
  And that’s just the beginning. With Kizen, **developers can build** new enterprise applications, while **business users can customize** dashboards and agents using AI, low-code, or code — all on the same platform. The possibilities are limited only by imagination.
  
  What used to take months or years to build, configure, and connect now takes just days. Kizen combines powerful pre-built agents and use cases with an enterprise platform for automation and data connection — all built on an AI-first architecture that’s easy to adopt, scale, and trust.
  
  We’re not chasing hype. We’re solving real operational problems and helping the world’s most complex organizations work faster, smarter, and more humanely.
  
  Join us in transforming how industries work — one workflow, one agent, and one customer success story at a time.
