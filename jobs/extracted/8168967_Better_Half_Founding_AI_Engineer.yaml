  AI alignment isn't bottlenecked by capability. It's
  bottlenecked by trust.
  
  Current AI fails in high-stakes contexts because it was
  never trained for relational competence. Models see
  knowledge, essays, code, and engagement-optimized social
  media — but never longitudinal healthy relating. And the
  objective function optimizes for engagement and utility, not
  relational integrity.
  
  The result? Addiction, sycophancy, psychosis, and suicide
  lawsuits. Plus, it's doing nothing to improve our social
  fabric, the strength of our communities, or the health of
  our relationships.
  
  Mental health apps see single-digit AI conversion despite
  massive demand. Robotics companies can't deploy into homes
  because LLMs can't handle human nuance. Defense and
  healthcare won't adopt AI that fails under stress.
  
  The opportunity: Whoever solves relational coherence wins
  consumer social AI, robotics, mental health, defense,
  education — and any domain where humans are vulnerable, the
  pressure is real, and mistakes matter.
  
  What we're pioneering: An orchestration engine based on
  research-backed Cumulative Prospect Theory and a model
  trained on empirical signals of human thriving — what we're
  calling Relational Reinforcement Learning (RRL).
  
  Your role: Build the execution layer that translates
  relational intelligence into natural conversation. This
  isn't a better chatbot. It's infrastructure for trustworthy
  AI in domains where the stakes run high and LLMs aren't good
  enough.
  
  What You’ll Build
  
  Better Half's decision layer (built by our CTO, former
  Distinguished Engineer at IBM) determines when users need
  pushback, softening, or repair.
  
  But decisions mean nothing without execution. You'll build
  the system that translates those decisions into LLM behavior
  that feels natural while optimizing for user thriving, not
  engagement.
  
  
  Affect Analysis Pipeline
  
  - Real-time emotion detection that feeds the decision layer
  - Multi-modal sentiment analysis (text, voice, timing,
    interaction patterns)
  - Track escalation/de-escalation signals across conversations
  
  Memory Systems
  
  - Storage and retrieval of relational context across sessions
  - Consistency checking to maintain relational coherence
  - Long-term modeling of user growth trajectories and
    relational capacity
  
  Prompt Engineering & Constrained Generation
  
  - Translate high-level decisions ("user needs reality-checking
    without triggering defensiveness") into effective prompts
  - Constrained generation that balances warmth with necessary
    friction
  - Template systems that adapt to user state and relationship
    phase
  
  LLM Integration & Orchestration
  
  - Multi-model orchestration (Mistral, Claude, others as
    needed)
  - Latency optimization for real-time conversation
  - Fallback strategies and graceful degradation
  
  Cloud Infrastructure
  
  - AWS or GCP architecture that scales
  - PostgreSQL and vector stores for memory
  - Privacy-preserving processing pipelines (on-device where
    possible)
  
  Evaluation & Monitoring
  
  - Build eval harnesses that measure relational outcomes, not
    just fluency
  - Tracing and feedback loops to ensure decisions land as
    intended
  - A/B testing framework for relational interventions
  
  Your Core Challenge
  
  Turning complex relational intelligence into natural
  conversation that makes people feel understood while
  actually helping them grow — without drifting into
  sycophancy or breaking immersion with safety theater.
  
  Skills You'll Need
  
  - Production-grade Python with async and clean architecture
  - LLM integration including prompt engineering, constrained
    generation and orchestration
  - Transformer models and sentiment/emotion classifiers
  - Cloud infrastructure on AWS or GCP, PostgreSQL, vector
    stores
  - Eval and monitoring with harnesses, tracing, and feedback
    loops
  - Implementing technical specs from academic papers
  - Multimodal inputs
  - Self-starter comfortable with 0-1 startup chaos
  
  Also Valuable
  
  - Utility theory and behavioral economics
  - Reinforcement learning
  - Game AI or dialogue systems experience
  - Rust
  
  Apply
  
  Competitive contractor compensation and meaningful founding
  engineer equity.
