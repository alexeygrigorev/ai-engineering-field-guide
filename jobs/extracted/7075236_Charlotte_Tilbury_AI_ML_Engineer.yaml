  Founded by British makeup artist and beauty entrepreneur
  Charlotte Tilbury MBE in 2013, Charlotte Tilbury Beauty has
  revolutionised the face of the global beauty industry by de-
  coding makeup applications for everyone, everywhere, with an
  easy-to-use, easy-to-choose, easy-to-gift range. Today,
  Charlotte Tilbury Beauty continues to break records across
  countries, channels, and categories and to scale at pace.
  
  Over the last 10 years, Charlotte Tilbury Beauty has
  experienced exceptional growth and is one of the most talked
  about brands in the beauty industry and beyond. It has
  become a global sensation across 50 markets (and growing),
  with over 2,300 employees globally who are part of the Dream
  Team making the magic happen.
  
  Today, Charlotte Tilbury Beauty is a truly global business,
  delivering market-leading growth, innovative retail and
  product launches fuelled by industry-leading tech — all with
  an internal culture of embracing challenges, disruptive
  thinking, winning together, and sharing the magic. The
  energy behind the bran­d is infectious, and as we grow, we
  are always looking for extraordinary talent who want to be
  part of this our success and help drive our limitless
  ambitions. About the role
  
  The AI & ML Engineering team accelerates the adoption of AI
  across the business, championing innovation while ensuring
  our machine learning products are robust, scalable, and
  cost-efficient. We enable teams to solve problems using
  existing AI tools where possible and build custom solutions
  when needed. Our remit spans AI enablement, agentic systems
  development, and “conventional” ML engineering for non-GenAI
  applications like recommender systems. This is a highly
  visible, hands-on engineering role with a strong focus on
  pragmatic, production-ready solutions that drive real
  business impact. This role and team collaborate closely with
  the wider Data team (Data Science, Core Data Engineering)
  and the wider organisation (Technology, Legal, Information
  Security) to onboard/develop & scale AI applications.
  
  As AI & ML Engineer you will be responsible for
  
  The role covers the full AI/ML engineering lifecycle, from
  discovery to deployment and monitoring. Responsibilities
  include
  
  - Partnering with stakeholders to scope problems and identify
    the right solution - whether leveraging existing AI tools
    or building custom workflows & solutions.
  - Designing and implementing agentic systems using techniques
    spanning RAG, grounding, prompt engineering, and
    orchestration on a GCP-first stack.
  - Building and maintaining production ML pipelines and
    services for non-GenAI use cases (e.g. recommender
    systems, customer segmentation models, marketing
    optimisation modules, leveraging supervised, unsupervised
    and/or econometric modelling approaches).
  - Developing APIs and microservices for AI/ML solutions,
    ensuring security, scalability, and observability.
  - Implementing CI/CD for ML services, writing infrastructure
    as code, and monitoring for model/data drift and
    performance.
  - Establishing robust guardrails for safe AI usage, including
    prompt security, practical evaluation frameworks, and
    compliance with privacy regulations.
  - Driving and evangelizing best practices, reusable templates,
    and documentation to scale AI/ML delivery across the
    business.
  - Collaborating with data engineers, data scientists, front &
    back-end engineers, product managers, legal & infosec
    colleagues to deliver impactful solutions end-to-end.
  
  Who you will work with
  
  The AI & ML Engineer Lead and the wider data team.
  
  About you
  
  The role requires a blend of technical depth and product
  sense, including
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science,
    Engineering, or related field.
  - Strong Python engineering skills (FastAPI, testing, typing)
    and experience with cloud-native development (GCP
    preferred).
  - Hands-on experience with GCP Vertex AI (model endpoints,
    pipelines, embeddings, vector search) or equivalent cloud-
    native ML platforms (e.g. AWS SageMaker, Azure ML) and
    agent orchestration frameworks such as LangChain and
    LangGraph
  - Solid understanding of MLOps - CI/CD, IaC (Terraform),
    experiment tracking, model registry, and monitoring.
  - Proven experience deploying and operating ML systems in
    production (batch and real-time).
  - Familiarity with RAG architectures, prompt engineering, and
    evaluation techniques.
  - Strong grasp of security, privacy, and governance principles
    (IAM, secrets, PII handling).
  - Excellent communication skills and ability to work with non-
    technical stakeholders.
  
  In addition to the above, we would LOVE if you have
  
  - Experience with vector databases and retrieval strategies.
  - Knowledge of recommender systems and ranking models.
  - Familiarity with LLM evaluation tools (e.g., RAGAS, TruLens,
    LangSmith, Arize).
  - Exposure to feature stores, data lineage, and observability
    stacks.
  - Experience in e-commerce or retail environments.
  - Demonstrable ability to weigh up build/build/configure
    decisions in the LLM space.
