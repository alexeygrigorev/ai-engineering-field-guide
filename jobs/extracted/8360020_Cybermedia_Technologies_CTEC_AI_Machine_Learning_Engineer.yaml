description: |
  CTEC is a leading technology firm that provides
  modernization, digital transformation, and application
  development services to the U.S. Federal Government.
  Headquartered in McLean, VA, CTEC has over 300 team members
  working on mission-critical systems and projects for
  agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security,
  Internal Revenue Service, and the Office of Personnel
  Management. The work we do effects millions of U.S. citizens
  daily as they interact with the systems we build. Our best-
  in-class commercial solutions, modified for our customers’
  bespoke mission requirements, are enabling this future every
  day.
  
  The Company has experienced rapid growth over the past 3
  years and recently received a strategic investment from Main
  Street Capital Corporation (NYSE: MAIN). In addition to our
  recent growth in Federal Civilian agencies, we are seeking
  to expand our capabilities in cloud development and
  footprint in national-security focused agencies within the
  Department of Defense and U.S. Intelligence Community.
  
  We are seeking to hire a AI/Machine Learning Engineer to our
  team!
  
  Role Overview: As an AI/ML Engineer for CTEC, you will
  develop Agentic AI systems designed to automate and optimize
  health benefits determinations for the Office of Personnel
  Management (OPM). Unlike traditional "black-box" models,
  your work will focus on marrying the reasoning capabilities
  of Large Language Models (LLMs) with deterministic, rule-
  driven patterns to ensure accuracy, auditability, and
  compliance in complex decision-making workflows.
  
  Duties and Responsibilities:
  
  - Agentic System Architecture: Design and deploy autonomous AI
    agents capable of multi-step reasoning, tool-use, and
    self-correction to navigate complex federal benefit
    policies.
  - Deterministic Logic Integration: Develop "Guardrail" layers
    that synchronize probabilistic LLM outputs with rigid
    business rules, ensuring benefit determinations adhere
    strictly to legal and regulatory frameworks.
  - RAG & Knowledge Engineering: Implement advanced Retrieval-
    Augmented Generation (RAG) solutions, utilizing layout-
    aware parsing to extract information from dense
    manuals/documentation and unstructured data.
  - Hybrid Model Development: Design and evaluate machine
    learning models that support both data-driven predictions
    and symbolic/rule-based automation.
  - MLOps & Agent Monitoring: Deploy models into cloud
    environments with a focus on LLM-specific observability
    (tracing reasoning loops, monitoring for hallucinations,
    and detecting data drift in logic).
  - Auditability & Explainability: Ensure every AI-driven
    determination has a clear, human-readable "audit trail" or
    reasoning chain that justifies the outcome based on source
    documentation.
  - Collaboration: Work alongside solution architects and
    business stakeholders to translate complex health
    insurance policies into executable AI logic.
  
  Skills & Work Experience:
  
  - Professional Experience: 5–8+ years in Machine Learning or
    Data Science, with at least 2 years of hands-on experience
    with LLM orchestration and Generative AI frameworks.
  - Agentic Frameworks: Proficiency with tools such as
    LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, or Semantic Kernel for
    building multi-step agent workflows.
  - Core Development: Strong proficiency in Python and
    experience with standard frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow,
    or Scikit-learn)
  - Data Engineering: Strong SQL skills and experience with
    distributed data processing (Spark/PySpark) to handle
    large-scale enterprise data.
  - Analytical Rigor: Ability to debug non-deterministic systems
    and implement rigorous evaluation frameworks (e.g., RAGAS,
    LLM-as-a-judge) data platforms.
  
  Preferred:
  
  - Experience with Azure Machine Learning, Azure AI services,
    or similar cloud AI platforms.
  - Experience implementing Generative AI, LLM, or RAG-based
    solutions.
  - Experience supporting federal IT modernization or data
    transformation programs.
  - Familiarity with healthcare, insurance, or benefits
    administration data environments.
  - Experience applying data governance, privacy, and security
    best practices in AI/ML solutions.
  
  Education:
  
  Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science,
  Engineering, or a related discipline. Master’s degree
  preferred. Equivalent professional experience will be
  considered in lieu of a degree.
  
  Clearance: Must be a U.S. citizen and be able to obtain an
  OPM Public Trust clearance.
  
  If you are looking for a fun and challenging environment
  with talented, motivated people to work with, CTEC is the
  right place for you. In addition to employee salary, we
  offer an array of employee benefits including:
  
  - Paid vacation & Sick leave
  - Health insurance coverage
  - Career training
  - Performance bonus programs
  - 401K contribution & Employer Match
  - 11 Federal Holidays
