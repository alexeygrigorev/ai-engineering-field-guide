  About Invisible
  
  Invisible Technologies makes AI work. Our end-to-end AI
  platform structures messy data, automates digital workflows,
  deploys agentic solutions, measures outcomes, and integrates
  human expertise where it matters most.
  
  Our platform cleans, labels, and structures company data so
  it is ready for AI. It adapts models to each business and
  adds human expertise when needed, the same approach we have
  used to improve models for more than 80% of the world’s top
  AI companies, including Microsoft, AWS, and Cohere.
  
  Our successes span industries, from supply chain automation
  for Swiss Gear to AI-enabled naval simulations with SAIC,
  and validating NBA draft picks for the Charlotte Hornets.
  
  Profitable for more than half a decade, Invisible reached
  $134M in revenue and ranked as the number two fastest
  growing AI company on the 2024 Inc. 5000. In September 2025,
  we raised $100M in growth capital to accelerate our mission
  of making AI actually work in the enterprise and to advance
  our platform technology.
  
  About The Role
  
  We are seeking a highly skilled and driven Software Engineer
  with a strong background in full-stack development,
  particularly in backend technologies and Agentic AI, to join
  our AI/ML team. In this role, you’ll work at the
  intersection of engineering, data science, and real-world
  impact, partnering directly with clients and internal
  stakeholders to design and deploy ML-powered tools that
  solve meaningful problems.
  
  This role combines hands-on model development with robust
  backend engineering and infrastructure work. You’ll help
  build scalable systems, support R&D initiatives, and ensure
  rapid iteration and deployment of machine learning solutions
  in dynamic, production-ready environments. You will work
  embedded with our top clients and the client teams to
  conduct use case discovery with senior stakeholders
  directly, developing solutions that address complex client
  needs. This will require being onsite with clients 3-4 days
  a week on a regular basis in New York.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - As part of the Forward Deployed Engineering team, you’ll
    contribute during a phase of rapid growth as we focus on
    scaling models and improving platform performance. You’ll
    help build backend systems, support client-facing
    deployments, and enable smoother workflows for machine
    learning solutions.
  - Develop and Maintain AI/ML Systems: Build robust, scalable
    backend systems that support machine learning operations
    and data processing pipelines
  - Cloud Operations and Management: Oversee and optimize cloud
    infrastructure to ensure efficient deployment and
    operation of ML models
  - Problem Solving: Independently explore and address complex
    problem spaces to improve system capabilities and
    performance without extensive guidance
  - Cross-Functional Collaboration: Work closely with ML
    engineers and data scientists to integrate advanced ML
    technologies, ensuring seamless operations across various
    platforms
  - Client Engagement: Collaborate directly with Invisible’s
    clients, working embedded with client teams to support use
    case discovery, product development, and AI deployment.
  - Innovation and R&D: Actively participate in research and
    development of new tools that can enhance our AI
    capabilities and workflows
  
  What We Need
  
  - 2+ years of software engineering experience, with a strong
    focus on ML engineering and deploying machine learning
    models in production.
  - Extensive experience in full-stack development, particularly
    in backend environments that support AI/ML workloads.
  - Prior experience working directly with clients in use case
    discovery, product development, and leading client
    engagements
  - Technical Expertise: Strong proficiency in Python, with deep
    expertise in LLMs, AI Agents, and ML model development.
  - Experience designing and deploying scalable ML systems, such
    as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and
    production-grade AI applications.
  - Extensive experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
    and operational best practices for ML workloads.
  - Familiarity with Kubernetes and other container management
    tools.
  - Ability to write well-structured, organized code and
    automated unit/E2E tests.
  - Comfortable with polyglot persistence models (SQL vs.
    NoSQL).
  - ML Operations: Experience with MLOps frameworks and best
    practices; familiarity with DevOps principles as applied
    to machine learning models, including model versioning,
    monitoring, and lifecycle management.
  - Problem Solving: Ability to operate independently in
    unstructured environments, demonstrating a proactive and
    investigative approach to tackling challenges
  - Communication: Excellent communication skills, with the
    ability to collaborate effectively in dynamic, cross-
    functional teams, including data scientists, researchers,
    and software engineers.
