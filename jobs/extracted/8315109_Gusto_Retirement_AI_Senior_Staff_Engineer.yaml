  About Gusto
  
  At Gusto, we're on a mission to grow the small business
  economy. We handle the hard stuff—like payroll, health
  insurance, 401(k)s, and HR—so owners can focus on their
  craft and customers. With teams in Denver, San Francisco,
  and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small
  businesses across the country, and we’re building a
  workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we
  serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy.
  
  About the Role:
  
  You’ll be a key engineer helping us ship real, user-facing
  AI at Gusto Retirement. This role is all about bias to
  action: owning problems end-to-end, getting working software
  in front of customers, and iterating quickly. You’ll work
  closely with a small, senior team to implement language-
  model-powered experiences. If you like being hands-on,
  making pragmatic technical decisions, working closely with
  product & design partners, and turning ideas into production
  features, you’ll be a great fit.
  
  About the Team:
  
  We’re a small, focused AI product team building practical,
  high-impact experiences to help people save for retirement
  at Gusto Retirement. The team is senior, collaborative, and
  very execution-focused—PMs bring strong ideas, and we own
  the execution fully. We work closely with product, design,
  and partner engineering teams, but keep tight ownership of
  our priorities and roadmap.
  
  Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day:
  
  - Design, build, and ship production features that use large
    language models to solve real customer problems.
  - Implement and integrate LLMs (prompting, tool loops,
    evaluation, monitoring, etc).
  - Make pragmatic architecture decisions, de-risk tricky areas,
    and keep the work unblocked.
  - Partner with product and design to refine ideas, shape
    scope, and iterate quickly on end-to-end experiences.
  - Collaborate with other engineering teams to integrate with
    existing systems and unblock dependencies.
  - Write clear, reliable, well-tested code that ships quickly
    and scales well.
  
  Here’s what we're looking for:
  
  - 10+ years of software engineering experience building and
    shipping production products or platforms
  - Hands-on experience implementing LLM-powered features (e.g.,
    RAG flows, agents, tool loops, workflow automation with
    language models, etc)
  - Strong engineering skills (e.g., services, APIs, data
    flows); comfortable spending most of your time coding.
  - Experience running or heavily contributing to a team’s
    execution: sprints, Jira, scoping, and cross-functional
    coordination.
  - Bias to action: you default to trying things, iterating, and
    learning, rather than getting stuck in analysis or waiting
    for direction.
  - Clear communicator who can work well with product, design,
    and other engineering teams without needing a formal
    management title.
  - Experienced with Ruby on Rails (or any comparable language),
    React (or any comparable library).
  
  Please note that travel to Gusto’s Denver office for
  onboarding is required for this position. If you have any
  questions regarding this requirement, please share with your
  recruiter.
  
  Our cash compensation amount for this role is targeted at
  $191,000/yr to $237,000/yr in Denver & most remote
  locations, and $225,000/yr to $279,000/yr for San Francisco,
  Seattle & New York. Stock equity is additional. Final offer
  amounts are determined by multiple factors including
  candidate experience and expertise and may vary from the
  amounts listed above.
  
  Gusto has physical office spaces in Denver, San Francisco,
  and New York City. Employees who are based in those
  locations will be expected to work from the office on
  designated days approximately 2-3 days per week (or more
  depending on role). The same office expectations apply to
  all Symmetry roles, Gusto's subsidiary, whose physical
  office is in Scottsdale.
  
  Note: The San Francisco office expectations encompass both
  the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas.
  
  When approved to work from a location other than a Gusto
  office, a secure, reliable, and consistent internet
  connection is required. This includes non-office days for
  hybrid employees.
  
  Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We
  hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not
  just because it's the right thing to do, but because it
  makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our
  enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at
  Gusto.
