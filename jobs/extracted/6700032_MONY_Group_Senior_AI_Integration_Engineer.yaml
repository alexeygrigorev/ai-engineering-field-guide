  At MONY Group, we’ve spent the last 30 years making it
  easier for people to save on their household bills, growing
  beyond comparison to support multiple areas of daily
  spending. As technology evolves, then so, do we. Looking at
  ways that we can improve our products and services to help
  our users to save more than ever before. Our work is fast-
  paced, collaborative, and constantly evolving – just like
  our teams that power it.
  
  We are looking for a talented AI Integration Engineer to
  join our growing team focused on building intelligent,
  customer-facing AI agents. In this role, you’ll leverage
  cutting-edge technologies, from large language models to
  multi-agent orchestration framework, to create high-impact
  AI solutions that directly interact with users. You'll also
  embrace the power of AI-assisted development to boost your
  productivity and code quality.
  
  AI at MONY Group
  
  Our strategy covers three core areas: how AI enhances the
  way we build and deliver products, how AI is embedded in
  existing products to enrich customer journeys with insight
  and value, and how services are built from the ground up for
  generative AI platforms, enabling holistic, conversational
  problem-solving.
  
  This role is sat in a team building our AI-native journeys.
  Consumer behaviour is rapidly shifting, and we're looking at
  how we reach customers in new channels and tackle problems
  in ground-breaking ways. Our work is underpinned in two
  ways, how are we enhancing what we offer today and what
  we’ll offer tomorrow.
  
  What will you be doing in the role?
  
  - Design, develop, and deploy intelligent AI agents using
    frameworks like Vercel AI SDK, LangChain, or AutoGen.
  - Integrate and optimize large language models (LLMs) through
    prompt engineering, chaining, and memory/context handling.
  - Enable agent-to-agent collaboration and reasoning workflows
    to support advanced customer interactions.
  - Develop scalable backend systems using Node.js and
    TypeScript.
  - Use GitHub Copilot and similar AI-powered development tools
    to accelerate coding, testing, and debugging workflows.
  - Build and maintain CI/CD pipelines to ensure smooth
    deployment and continuous improvement.
  - Work with AWS infrastructure (Lambda, ECS, S3, API Gateway,
    etc.) for scalable and secure deployment.
  - Collaborate closely with product managers and designers to
    deliver user-focused AI experiences.
  
  What we're looking for:
  
  - Strong experience with LLMs, prompt design, and agent
    frameworks.
  - Proficient in TypeScript, Node.js, and modern backend
    architecture.
  - Comfortable with AWS services and infrastructure-as-code.
  - Familiar with CI/CD tools and DevOps best practices.
  - Experience using AI tools like GitHub Copilot to enhance
    software development productivity.
  
  Nice to Have:
  
  - Master’s or Ph.D. in Computer Science, Artificial
    Intelligence, Machine Learning, or a related field.
  - Experience developing multi-agent systems or autonomous
    reasoning workflows.
  - Familiarity with front-end tools like React or Next.js for
    end-to-end integration.
  - Understanding of responsible AI principles, including model
    safety and ethical considerations.
