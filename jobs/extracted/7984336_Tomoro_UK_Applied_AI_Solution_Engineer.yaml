  About Tomoro
  
  Tomoro enables organisations to realise competitive
  advantage with the power of Generative AI. We work with
  large corporate clients to create meaningful AI strategies,
  build production-ready AI solutions and effectively
  integrate those solutions in their businesses.
  
  Our alliance with OpenAI and NVIDIA (among others) enables
  us to lead the industry in building valuable, scalable,
  enterprise-ready solutions for businesses.
  
  We’re driven by applied R&D, prototyping and AI innovation.
  Our client teams are focused on tackling the most
  challenging aspects of applied AI in the enterprise sector
  directly with clients.
  
  About the role
  
  Applied AI solution engineers are expected to work in small
  teams of Tomoro and client engineers to design, build and
  deploy AI applications, such as agents built around Large
  Language Models.
  
  As your experience and expertise in the role grows, this may
  extend to leading these teams, owning solutions end-to-end
  and advising clients in this space.
  
  The typical applications we build use existing closed or
  open-source foundational models, potentially with some fine
  tuning. We generally do not need to train our own
  foundational models from scratch.
  
  Requirements
  
  Responsibilities
  
  The examples describe the types of responsibilities AI
  solution engineers at Tomoro will have.
  
  We do not expect every successful candidate to have
  experience in all of these areas. We encourage you
  
  to apply if the role excites you and you believe you can
  demonstrate a combination of the following capabilities.
  
  AI Solution Development
  
  Building AI-powered solutions, particularly those involving
  large language models with our client partners. You’ll be
  hands-on and will own design and build of such solutions.
  
  Client Consultation and Communication
  
  Regularly interacting with clients to understand their
  business challenges, goals, and requirements, and
  effectively communicating how AI solutions can address their
  needs.
  
  Technical Problem-Solving
  
  Solving complex technical problems that arise during the
  development and implementation of AI solutions. You’ll also
  help bring some of these “tough problems” back to Tomoro R&D
  team and work with them to solve problems for the industry.
  
  Technical Leadership
  
  Providing technical guidance and leadership within the team,
  including mentoring junior engineers and contributing to
  team skill development.
  
  Cross-Functional Collaboration
  
  Working collaboratively with other teams within the company,
  including non-technical teams, to ensure an integrated
  approach to AI solution development and implementation.
  
  Continuous Learning and Adaptation
  
  Staying updated with the latest developments in AI, machine
  learning, and related technologies to continually enhance
  the quality of solutions offered.
  
  Quality Assurance and Testing
  
  Ensuring the reliability, effectiveness, and safety of AI
  solutions through rigorous testing and quality assurance
  practices.
  
  Ethical Consideration and Compliance
  
  Upholding and actively contributing to ethical standards in
  AI development, including considerations for data privacy,
  bias minimization, and regulatory compliance. Help expand
  our knowledge on this subject and help drive ethical ways to
  implement AI.
  
  Client Training and Support
  
  Assisting clients in understanding and effectively using AI
  solutions, and providing ongoing support and maintenance as
  needed.
  
  Indicators you’ll be a good fit
  
  Strong hands-on experience of developing production-grade
  solutions involving:
  
  • Building Microservices (including scalable data pipelines
  using frameworks like Spark)
  
  • Data technologies (Python, SQL)
  
  • Large language models, fine tuning (closed & open source,
  OpenAI API)
  
  • Solution design (mainly data applications using Python,
  SQL and other allied tech stack)
  
  • Analytical problem solving
  
  We are not restricted to the technologies we use to solve
  client challenges and are looking for people who are able to
  adapt to a new stack when needed.
  
  Comfortable being client-facing
  
  Our business is helping other businesses transform with AI.
  We cannot do that by looking inwards. Our Technical team is
  not behind the scenes, it is very much the front of house.
  We are proud of our technical expertise in this space, and
  it is primarily what our clients are buying. We need our
  technical staff to also be our client ambassadors, which
  includes:
  
  • Communication & translation: Excellent communication
  skills to effectively interact with clients, understand
  their needs and explain complex AI concepts in an accessible
  manner.
  
  • Business acumen: Understanding of business processes and
  how AI solutions can be used to improve efficiency, reduce
  costs, or create new opportunities.
  
  Adaptable and self-sufficient
  
  As a growing, fast-paced organisation, Tomoro offers
  significant opportunities for rapid growth for everyone in
  the team. In this stage of the business, we have limited
  capacity for handholding and need each team member to be
  able to operate independently and be flexible to work
  outside of their comfort zone.
  
  Passionate and positive
  
  Tomoro exists because we believe we can drive transformative
  change with AI across entire industries.
  
  Everyone in the team needs to share the passion for AI
  technology and its power for good.
  
  Creative and curious
  
  Staying at the forefront of the AI revolution requires
  everyone in the team to be aware of the latest developments
  in AI technology and innovating to find new ways to solve
  some of the hardest unsolved challenges in industry. Pro-
  active self-learning and openness to new ideas are
  essential.
  
  Ethical and responsible
  
  Our people are our greatest defence against the risks AI
  solutions can pose to individuals, organisations and
  society. Everyone in our team needs to show awareness of
  ethical considerations in AI, such as data privacy, bias in
  AI models, and the societal impact of AI technologies.
