  About the team
  
  Adaptive ML is a frontier AI startup building a
  Reinforcement Learning Operations (RLOps) platform that
  enables enterprises to specialize large language models and
  deploy them reliably into production workflows with
  measurable impact.
  
  At Adaptive ML, our Success team is part of our Technical
  Staff. Our Technical Staff develops the foundational
  technology that powers Adaptive ML, while the Success Team
  ensures our enterprise customers effectively leverage these
  technologies—particularly through our Adaptive Engine
  product—to unlock maximum value.  Adaptive Engine enables
  companies to build, evaluate, and deploy the best models for
  their specific business needs. The founding team previously
  worked together to develop state-of-the-art open LLMs. We
  raised a $20M seed round led by Index Ventures and ICONIQ in
  early 2024 and are live with our first enterprise customers,
  including Manulife, AT&T, Deloitte and more to be announced.
  
  About the role
  
  As an AI Engineer (Pre-Sales) at Adaptive ML, you will be
  the technical counterpart to our sales team, helping
  prospective customers understand how Adaptive Engine can
  solve their hardest problems. You will design and deliver
  high-impact demos, guide customers through proof of
  concepts, and develop technical proposals that highlight the
  differentiated value of our platform and reinforcement
  learning.
  
  Unlike many sales engineering roles, this position is deeply
  technical. You’ll have the opportunity to use Adaptive
  Engine hands-on—building demos, fine-tuning LLMs, and
  standing up pilots that bridge the gap from prospect to
  customer. You will also help shape the product roadmap by
  surfacing customer needs and insights.
  
  This is an in-person role based in our Toronto or New York
  offices.
  
  Your responsibilities
  
  - Partner with sales to engage with prospects, uncovering
    business challenges and mapping them to Adaptive ML
    solutions;
  - Design and deliver compelling technical demos, tailored to
    specific customer use cases;
  - Lead and manage proof-of-concepts (POCs) and pilots,
    ensuring technical success and clear business outcomes;
  - Build prototype pipelines and fine-tuned LLMs using Adaptive
    Engine to showcase production-ready solutions;
  - Translate technical requirements into custom proposals,
    suggested architectures, and recommendations for customer
    deployments;
  - Collaborate with our research and product teams to influence
    roadmap priorities based on customer feedback;
  - Represent Adaptive ML at conferences, webinars, and industry
    events with technical authority.
  
  Your (ideal) background
  
  The background below is only suggestive of a few pointers we
  believe could be relevant. We welcome applications from
  candidates with diverse backgrounds; do not hesitate to get
  in touch if you think you could be a great fit, even if the
  below doesn't fully describe you.
  
  - A degree in computer science, or demonstrated experience in
    software engineering / machine learning;
  - 4–8+ years in a pre-sales, solutions engineering, or
    technical consulting role, ideally in AI/ML or enterprise
    software;
  - Hands-on experience with data science, machine learning, or
    NLP; ability to fine-tune or adapt models is a plus;
  - Strong programming skills, with Python required from quick
    prototyping to proof-of-concept deployments;
  - Exceptional communication skills—able to clearly explain
    technical concepts to both technical and non-technical
    audiences;
  - Curiosity and enthusiasm for generative AI, with a passion
    for building demos and real-world applications;
  - Empathy, humility, and a collaborative spirit when working
    with both customers and teammates.
  
  Benefits
  
  - Comprehensive medical (health, dental, and vision)
    insurance;
  - 401(k) plan with 4% matching (or equivalent);
  - Unlimited PTO — we strongly encourage at least 5 weeks each
    year;
  - Mental health, wellness, and personal development stipends;
  - Visa sponsorship if you wish to relocate to New York or
    Paris.
