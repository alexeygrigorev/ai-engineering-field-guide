  We’re reinventing payments. In less than four years, Dojo
  disrupted the market to become the largest and most loved
  acquirer in the UK. Our payments infrastructure, purpose-
  built for in-person commerce, is game changing.
  
  Now, over 150,000 customers across four countries choose to
  transact billions with us every year. But we’re just getting
  started.
  
  Our people are the driving force behind our success. They
  are our greatest investment and our ultimate competitive
  advantage. We hire exceptional people and give them the
  autonomy, trust, and ownership to thrive. The results take
  care of themselves.
  
  
  
  The Role...
  
  As an AI Platform Engineer, you’ll be part of the team
  designing and running the core AI platform. You’ll work on
  APIs, pipelines, observability, security, and orchestration,
  ensuring our AI solutions can move from experiment to
  production smoothly. This role is about building the
  foundations of AI adoption — if you enjoy combining
  distributed systems, cloud engineering, and AI tooling into
  something bigger, this is it.
  
  
  
  We are looking for someone who takes pride & ownership in
  what they build, being able to voice their opinion and share
  their expertise, but also listen and make the correct
  decision. They shouldn’t be afraid to celebrate their
  successes, admit their mistakes and turn to others for help,
  maintaining a sense of honesty and humility. They should be
  looking to improve each day, caring about the tech,
  architecture, and people they interact with, understanding
  both the small details and the big picture in everything we
  do. Finally, they should be able to coach, mentor, and
  inspire those around them, embedding excellence, a sense of
  safety, and a desire to succeed in their teams, ensuring
  these values are adhered to at all levels. What you will do…
  
  - Design and build the AI platform that powers LLMs, agents,
    and other AI solutions across Dojo.
  - Develop APIs, SDKs, and tooling that allow product teams to
    consume AI capabilities at scale while having great
    developer experience
  - Implement orchestration for multi-model and multi-service
    workflows (e.g., LangGraph, Crew AI , Google Agent
    Development Kit, agentic frameworks).
  - Build and Manage vector search and retrieval systems to
    support RAG and knowledge integration.
  - Build robust monitoring, logging, and guardrails to ensure
    AI systems are safe, observable, and compliant using
    solutions like Langsmith , Opik, Prometheus and Grafana.
  - Automate infrastructure and model deployment with
    Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines.
  - Partner with security, compliance, and product to ensure
    safe use of AI in production.
  - Stay on top of AI platform trends, open-source tools, and
    emerging patterns — bringing best practices into our
    stack.
  
  What you'll bring...
  
  - Strong software engineering or Platform engineering
    background (Python/GO/Java; Go/Java/.NET a bonus).
  - Solid experience with distributed systems, microservices,
    and cloud-native architecture (GCP preferred).
  - Hands-on experience with Kubernetes, service mesh, and
    event-driven systems.
  - Familiarity with LLM orchestration frameworks (LangChain,
    LangGraph, CrewAI, GCP ADK or similar).
  - Experience with vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate,
    Vertex Vector Search) and RAG pipelines.
  - Knowledge of MLOps/AI infra tools (MLflow, VertexAI, Ollama,
    OpenRouter etc).
  - Strong CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code skills (Terraform,
    Helm, etc.).
  - Good understanding of AI governance, monitoring, and
    responsible AI practices.
  - Comfort balancing speed (PoCs) with robustness (production-
    ready systems).
  
  Dojo home and away
  
  We believe our best work happens when we collaborate in-
  person. These “together days” foster communication, drive
  innovation and spark our brightest ideas.
  
  That's why we have an office-first culture. This means
  working from the office 4+ days per week.
  
  With offices across Europe, we know a thing or two about
  staying dynamic. Need deep focus? Head to a quiet zone. Big
  ideas? Collaboration spaces have you covered. Just here for
  a catch-up? Our social hubs make it easy. Do work that
  counts, in spaces made for you.
  
  Question: what’s curious, relentless, and customer obsessed?
  
  If you’re keen to know the answer, you’re a third of the way
  to meeting our Dojo values.
  
  If the following speak to you, let’s talk:
  
  - You’re curious. You have a real desire to learn and create.
  - You’re relentless. You keep going even when it’s easier not
    to.
  - You’re customer-obsessed. You know how important customers
    are to what you do.
  
  
  
  Diversity, equity, and inclusion at Dojo
  
  From local bakeries to well-known eateries, Dojo payments
  serve over 150,000 places across the UK.
  
  And something that’s fundamental to creating relevant,
  innovative products at Dojo is to build teams to reflect the
  diversity of the businesses we serve.
  
  Our drive to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion is
  closely linked to helping employees thrive and innovating
  for better customer experiences.
  
  If you care about your work, you’re curious, and you think
  customer-first, you have a place at Dojo.
  
  To make sure you’re the best you can be throughout the
  recruitment process, let us know if you need any extra
  adjustments to help you thrive.
