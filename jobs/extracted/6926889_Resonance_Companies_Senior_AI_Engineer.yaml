  **About Us**
  
  Resonance is a technology company building a more sustainable and valuable fashion industry for designers, brands, manufacturers, consumers, and the planet. The company’s AI-powered operating system ONE enables brands to design, sell, and make in that order, empowering designers to operate with no unnecessary inventory and eliminating the financial and environmental burdens of the legacy fashion industry.
  
  Resonance ONE is our software that powers any apparel company. Resonance ONE uses an emergent behavior model that redefines how garments are designed, sold and made with an “I know nothing” mindset that is constantly learning from our users. Resonance ONE includes the following:
   
  - An apparel brand or creator’s digital operating system to launch and run their brand’s business.
   
  - An AI Agentic framework, Contracts, and APIs for functions that span the end-to-end creation-to-closet functionality, including everything from 3D volumetric design and collection creation to payments to orders to inventory management and some non-standard processes that are specific to Resonance workflows
   
  - Internal value chain routing, organization, and optimization of garment manufacturing. Future analytics and machine learning functions for learning and optimization.
   
  
  ONE primarily focuses on building a learning system that teaches optimally how to produce garments sustainably and without legacy restrictions.
  
  Headquartered in New York City and Santiago, Dominican Republic, Resonance has partnered with more than 30 brands, including THE KIT and Rebecca Minkoff, to create garments that use 97% less dye, 70% less water, and 50% less material than any other fashion brand—and immediately eliminate overproduction.
