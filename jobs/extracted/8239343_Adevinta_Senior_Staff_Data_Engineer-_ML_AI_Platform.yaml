description: |
  **Marktplaats** in The Netherlands, and **2dehands** and **2ememain** in Belgium, are part of Adevinta: a global online classifieds specialist. The three brands are hosted on a multi-tenant platform, operated from our Amsterdam location, and are the top players in the classifieds space throughout the Benelux region. 
  
  We offer consumers the opportunity to trade their unwanted products and contribute to a greener, circular economy. We offer businesses - of all sizes, from the smallest hobbyist to the biggest brands in Benelux - a platform to showcase their goods and services online to over 11 million monthly unique users.
  
  **What you’ll do & Who you are**
  
  At Marktplaats, data is at the heart of everything we do, but Intelligence is what differentiates us. We are building the ML/AI Platform that powers innovation across our entire Product & Technology landscape.
  
  You will join the **Data Platform team**—the engineering engine behind our Data & Analytics crew. You are stepping into a unique, **hybrid ecosystem**: we maintain a robust, high-scale **traditional ML environment** used daily by teams across Marktplaats, while simultaneously acting as the architects for our emerging **GenAI capabilities**. We are a team that values engineering rigor just as much as experimentation, looking for a leader to help us bridge the gap between stable production services and the bleeding edge of AI.
  
  As a **Senior Staff Data Engineer - ML & AI Platform**, you will be the bridge between infrastructure and **Data Science**, ensuring that our ML/AI environment is **robust, scalable, and developer-friendly**. Your mission is to solve the **"last mile" problem** of ML: making it easy to move models from a notebook to a high-scale production API.
  
  You are an **R&D-minded leader** who loves to experiment with the latest features (e.g., **Databricks Agents**, **RAG Studio**) and operationalize them into stable platform features. You will empower AI/ML Engineers and Data Scientists to be autonomous by building the tooling they need to **self-serve**.
  **Key Responsibilities**
  - 
  
  **Platform Leadership:** Lead the evolution of our Machine Learning & AI Platform, designing the architecture for **AI Agents** and establishing patterns for **Vector Databases**.
  
  - 
  
  **Operationalize Innovation:** Act as a **"first mover."** When Databricks releases a new feature (e.g., **Liquid Clustering**, **Agent Evaluation**), you validate it and integrate it into the platform.
  
  - 
  
  **GenAI Governance:** Write the guidelines for **GenAI development**, helping teams transition from "notebook experiments" to **production-grade LLM applications**.
  
  - 
  
  **Enablement:** Design the **Feature Store**, manage the **Model Registry**, and set up the infrastructure for **Vector Search** and **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** workflows.
  
  - 
  
  **Mentorship:** Elevate the technical bar of the team, mentoring Staff and Senior engineers on **design patterns**, code quality, and architectural decisions.
  
  - 
  
  **Translation:** Translate complex requirements from ML Engineers and Data Scientists into robust **engineering tickets** and **infrastructure roadmaps**.
  
  ******Core Technologies**
  - 
  
  **Databricks AI Stack:** **MLflow**, **Mosaic AI**, Unity Catalog, Feature Store, **Databricks Model Serving**, Vector Databases.
  
  - 
  
  **Big Data & Compute:** Apache Spark (**Internals & Optimization**), AWS (GPU instances, EC2).
  
  - 
  
  **GenAI & Agents:** Databricks Agent tools.
  
  - 
  
  **Languages:** Python (**Expert level**), PyTorch.

  **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions.
  
  - 
  
  **Observability:** Datadog.
  
  ******What We’re Looking For**
  - 
  
  **Experience:** **10+ years** of experience with a specific focus on the intersection of **Data Engineering**, **MLOps**, and **AI Infrastructure**.
  
  - 
  
  **Spark Mastery:** You don't just run jobs; you **optimize** them. You possess deep knowledge of **Spark internals**, **structured streaming**, and performance tuning for large-scale data processing.
  
  - 
  
  **MLOps Authority:** Proven experience architecting end-to-end ML platforms for **Traditional ML (Classic MLOps)** while actively enabling the organization on **Generative AI** concepts.
  
  - 
  
  **DevOps Mindset:** You treat **infrastructure as software**. You have a strong background in building automated pipelines and ensuring system observability.
  
  - 
  
  **GenAI Readiness:** Practical experience building infrastructure for **Large Language Models**, including managing the complexity of **chaining models** and tools.
  
  - 
  
  **Serving Expertise:** Solid experience serving models at **low latency** and **high concurrency** using containerized solutions.
  
  - 
  
  **Collaborative Spirit:** You speak the language of **AI/ML Engineers** and can effectively bridge the gap between "**experimental code**" and "**production systems**."
