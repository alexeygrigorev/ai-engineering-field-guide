  **About Imagen**
  
  Imagen Technologies is building the AI-enabled teleradiology practice of the future. We operate the first vertically integrated medical practice and AI development platform focused on reducing diagnostic error and giving radiologists superpowers through industry-leading AI solutions developed in-house. With over $200 million in funding from investors such as Google Ventures and some of the largest clinical networks in the country, we are rapidly expanding this platform across the U.S.—from 22 states and 2.7 million patients in 2025 to more than 35 states and over 5 million patients annually by 2027. We are the fastest-growing teleradiology group in the U.S., and by the end of next year, we will have the fifth-largest practice in the country.
  
  **About the Role **
  
  We’re looking for an experienced Lead Data Engineer to join our team and spearhead the evolution of our AI Data Platform. This internally developed platform is the backbone of our AI development, which has resulted in 6 FDA-cleared AI products aimed at reducing turnaround times and diagnostic error rates. The Lead Data Engineer and their team will manage billions of medical images and reports that are foundational data that will drive the development of Imagen's next generation of diagnostic tools.
  
  In this role, you will take ownership of our data infrastructure, leading the technical strategy and development efforts to scale, optimize, and enhance our capabilities. This position is ideal for a hands-on engineer who is passionate about building robust data systems and wants to see their work have a tangible impact on patient outcomes. You'll report to the Head of Engineering and partner closely with Imagen's Chief AI Officer, Product leaders, and engineers to design and ship new software that drives the future of diagnostic imaging.
  
  **Responsibilities: **
  
  - **Architect and Own the AI Data Platform: **You will take full ownership of the technical roadmap and architecture for our multi-petabyte, multi-cloud data platform. Your primary goal will be to ensure our AI teams have reliable, scalable, and performant access to high-quality medical data.
  
  - **Build and Scale Data Pipelines: **Design, build, and maintain robust data ingestion, processing, and transformation pipelines for billions of medical images (e.g., DICOM) and clinical reports. You'll focus on creating systems that are automated, observable, and efficient.
  
  - **Evaluate, select, and implement a modern workflow orchestration solution** (e.g., Airflow, Prefect, Dagster) to manage our end-to-end data pipelines for medical image processing.
  
  - **Champion Data Quality and Governance: **Implement and enforce rigorous data quality frameworks, validation checks, and security protocols. As the steward of our most sensitive data, you will ensure all aspects of the platform are secure and compliant with standards like HIPAA.
  
  - **Lead Technical Strategy and Best Practices: **Establish and champion best practices in data engineering, DataOps, and infrastructure management. You will make key decisions on tooling and technology, driving the technical direction for all data-related initiatives.
  
  - **Partner with the AI Team: **Serve as the primary technical partner and subject matter expert for our AI and research teams. You will collaborate closely with them to understand their data requirements and build solutions that accelerate their model development lifecycle.
  
  **Required Qualifications:**
  
  - Mission-driven and passionate about building foundational technology to improve healthcare.
  
  - **5+ years of hands-on experience in data engineering**, or software engineering with a data focus.
  
  - **2+ years of experience in a senior or lead role**, with a proven track record of owning technical roadmaps and making significant architectural decisions.
  
  - **Expert-level proficiency in Python** and a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms. Mastery of **SQL** is also required.
  
  - **Deep expertise with at least one major cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)** and proven experience designing and managing solutions in a cloud-native environment.
  
  - Hands-on experience with modern data stack technologies, such as:Workflow orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow, Prefect, Dagster).
  
  - Large-scale data processing frameworks (e.g., Spark, Dask).
  
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation).
  
  - Containerization technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
  
  - Demonstrated experience designing and managing data lakes, data warehouses, or petabyte-scale object storage systems (e.g., S3, GCS).
  
  - BS in Computer Science or a related field, or equivalent real-world experience.
  
  **Preferred Qualifications:**
  
  - Experience working in a multi-cloud environment and managing cross-cloud data transfer and cost optimization.
  
  - Experience with MLOps or building infrastructure that directly supports the machine learning lifecycle.
  
  - Familiarity with healthcare data standards and regulations (e.g., HIPAA, DICOM, FHIR).
  
  - Direct experience engineering solutions for diverse medical imaging modalities (e.g., CT, MR, XR, Ultrasound).
  
  - Experience building systems in a regulated or compliance-heavy industry.
