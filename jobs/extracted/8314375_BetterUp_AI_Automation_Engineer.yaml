  Let’s face it, a company whose mission is human
  transformation better have some fresh thinking about the
  employer/employee relationship.
  
  We do. We can’t cram it all in here, but you’ll start
  noticing it from the first interview.
  
  Even our candidate experience is different. And when you get
  an offer from us (and accept it), you get way more than a
  paycheck. You get a personal BetterUp Coach, a development
  plan, a trained and coached manager, the most amazing team
  you’ve ever met (yes, each with their own personal BetterUp
  Coach), and most importantly, work that matters.
  
  This makes for a remarkably focused and fulfilling work
  experience. Frankly, it’s not for everyone. But for people
  with fire in their belly, it’s a game-changing, career-
  defining, soul-lifting move.
  
  Join us and we promise you the most intense and fulfilling
  years of your career, doing life-changing work in a fun,
  inventive, soulful culture.
  
  If that sounds exciting—and the job description below feels
  like a fit—we really should start talking.
  
  We are a hybrid company with a focus on in-person
  collaboration when necessary. Employees are expected to be
  available to work from one of our office hubs at least two
  days per week, or eight days per month. Our US hub locations
  include: Austin, TX; Chicago, IL; New York City, NY; San
  Francisco, CA; and the Washington, DC metro area. If this is
  a role based in Europe, our Europe hub locations are London,
  UK and Amsterdam, NL. Please ensure you can realistically
  commit to this structure before applying.
  
  We’re looking for an AI Automation and Integration Engineer
  to join our rapidly evolving IT & AI Workspace Technology
  team. This role is for a hands-on builder who thrives on
  creating smarter, more connected systems—someone who can
  transform manual workflows into intelligent, AI-enabled
  automations using cutting-edge tools like Model Context
  Protocol (MCP), Slack workflows, and secure system
  integrations.
  
  You’ll design and implement scalable automations across our
  SaaS ecosystem, partner closely with our AI product and
  infrastructure teams, and bring a high degree of technical
  rigor and curiosity to every problem you solve.
  
  This is a key role on a small, fast-moving team where your
  work will directly impact how we scale, automate, and
  future-proof our internal operations.
  
  What you’ll do:
  
  MCP & AI Workflow Engineering
  
  - Implement and scale our Model Context Protocol (MCP) to
    support secure, composable AI workflows across Slack,
    Jira, Salesforce, GitHub, AWS-based infrastructure, LLM
    providers (e.g., Claude), and internal APIs.
  - Design agentic systems that enable AI tooling to integrate
    seamlessly with operational data and user identity
    services.
  - Author requests for comments (RFCs), technical requirements
    documents (TRDs), and internal documentation to align MCP
    features with enterprise use cases.
  
  Automation & Integration Development
  
  - Build and maintain scalable automations and secure APIs to
    reduce operational overhead in onboarding, provisioning,
    and data lifecycle management.
  - Own development and maintenance of reusable modules for
    identity sync, data uploads (e.g., CSV bulk importers),
    and AI-to-API orchestration.
  - Drive continuous improvement across automation platforms by
    collaborating with stakeholder teams across the business.
  
  Security, Identity & System Governance
  
  - Work with InfoSec and IT teams to enforce role-based access
    controls and SAML/SSO integrations
  - Harden identity workflows across US and EU regions, ensuring
    compliance with internal and external standards.
  - Support audit readiness through traceable change management
    and data integrity practices.
  
  Cross-Functional Collaboration
  
  - Attend cross functional standups, Architecture Roundtables,
    and AI working groups to ensure engineering solutions
    align with company goals.
  - Partner closely with stakeholders to balance speed and
    safety in fast-moving pilot initiatives.
  - Advocate for test-driven development (TDD), documentation,
    and open source-inspired code reusability.
  
  What Success Looks Like
  
  - MCP server scaled and adopted across multiple workflows with
    stable, secure integrations
  - Automation measurably reduced manual data entry through bulk
    import and automation tooling (e.g., 50% reduction).
  - Onboarding and provisioning latency improved through
    identity automation (e.g., 30% faster completion).
  - Clear documentation, playbooks, and dashboards enable
    stakeholders to self-serve with AI tools and automation
    templates, not rely on ad-hoc IT custom work.
  - All automation systems have strong test coverage, robust
    monitoring, and meet security review requirements, with
    audit-ready logs for provisioning and data movement.
  - Impact is visible and quantified through simple time-saved
    and adoption metrics layered on top of Jira, dashboards,
    and usage telemetry.
  
  If you have some or all of the following, please apply:
  
  Required:
  
  - 3–6 years of professional experience in software or systems
    engineering, with demonstrated ability to own backend
    services, integrations, or automation workflows with
    minimal oversight.
  - Experience integrating AI capabilities into production
    systems, including orchestrating LLM-powered workflows
    across APIs, event-driven systems, and internal services.
  - Hands-on experience designing AI-assisted automations that
    operate on real business data with appropriate context,
    permissions, and safeguards.
  - Familiarity with using LLM providers (e.g., Claude or
    similar) as part of larger systems rather than standalone
    chat or prompt-based tools.
  - Demonstrated experience integrating APIs and building
    automations across complex SaaS ecosystems.
  - Proficiency in n8n and Zapier or custom-built orchestration
    tools
  - Hands-on experience building pipelines or automations using
    MCP, Step Functions, or equivalent event-driven
    architectures
  - Strong scripting or development skills (e.g., Python, ROR or
    JavaScript) for writing custom connectors or data
    transformations
  - Familiarity with common SaaS platforms including Okta, Jira,
    Slack, Workday, Google Workspace, FreshService, and their
    APIs
  - Experience working with authentication protocols (e.g.,
    SAML, OAuth), and systems like Okta, GCP, or AWS.
  
  Preferred:
  
  - Experience operating MCP-based or similar AI-enabled
    workflows in production environments, including
    considerations for reliability, observability, and ongoing
    maintenance.
  - Prior contributions to audit, compliance, or governance-
    related tooling, such as provisioning logs, access
    tracking, or data integrity checks.
  - Strong documentation practices, including maintaining
    technical artifacts (RFCs, diagrams, runbooks, and
    playbooks) as part of day-to-day work.
  - Comfort acting as an embedded technical partner to non-
    technical stakeholders (e.g., HR, Recruiting, People Ops,
    Finance), with the ability to explain complex systems
    clearly, set expectations, and co-own automation roadmaps.
  - Familiarity with operating and debugging production systems
    using tools such as logging, monitoring, and basic data
    stores (e.g., DataDog, Postgres, Redis), as well as
    supporting file-based or “last mile” integrations when
    needed.
  - Comfort with working as an embedded partner with non-
    technical stakeholders (EAs, HR, Recruiting, People Ops,
    Finance), including training them on automation patterns
    and co-owning roadmaps for the next set of high-impact
    automations.
