With over 2,000 customers and ARR that has more than quadrupled over the past year, ClickHouse leads the market in real-time analytics, data warehousing, observability, and AI workloads. ClickHouse’s incredible momentum was confirmed in its recent $400M Series D financing round. We’re on a mission to transform how companies use data. Come be a part of our journey!
  
  NOTE: This role is not office-based, and the final candidate can be in any EMEA country ClickHouse hires in (such as The Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Italy, UK, or Portugal).
  
  We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer to drive the development of AI/ML-powered features in ClickHouse Cloud. In this role, you will bridge the gap between a high-performance database technology like ClickHouse and AI capabilities, implementing AI/ML integrations and end-to-end solutions from the Inference API layer to the user interface that enhance how users interact with and extract value from their data.
  
  **What will you do?**
  
  - **Feature Development:** Design and implement AI-powered features across the full stack, from backend inference services to intuitive frontend interfaces within the ClickHouse Cloud platform.
  
  - **API Architecture:** Create robust, scalable APIs that connect ClickHouse's database capabilities with modern AI/ML inference systems and external/internal AI services.
  
  - **UI/UX Implementation:** Build responsive, intuitive user interfaces that make complex AI functionalities accessible and valuable to users of all technical backgrounds.
  
  - **Ecosystem Integrations:** Implement and maintain integrations with the broader AI/ML ecosystem and standards, ensuring that ClickHouse as a technology works seamlessly with popular frameworks and tools.
  
  - **Technical Integration:** Integrate models into production systems with proper monitoring, versioning, observability, and evaluation.
  
  **What you bring along:**
  
  - 5+ years of software engineering experience in **production environments**
  
  - Exposure to working directly with AI/ML technologies
  
  - Strong frontend skills with TypeScript/JavaScript and React
  
  - Backend development experience in TypeScript or Python, with a focus on API design and service architecture
  
  - You have a high level of ownership and can drive features from concept to production with minimal supervision
  
  - You thrive in collaborative environments and can effectively communicate technical concepts to diverse stakeholders
  
  **Nice to have**
  
  - Experience building data-oriented interfaces and visualizations
  
  - Experience integrating and deploying AI/ML models in production systems, including working with inference APIs and vector databases
  
  - Familiarity with cloud technologies such as AWS, Azure, or GCP, particularly services related to AI/ML deployment
  
  - Understanding of database systems and data processing pipelines, with ClickHouse experience being a significant plus
