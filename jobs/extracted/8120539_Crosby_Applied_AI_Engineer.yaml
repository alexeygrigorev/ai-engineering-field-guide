  Welcome to Crosby, the next generation Law Company
  
  We're a team of technologists and legal experts
  collaborating closely to reimagine corporate legal services
  from the ground up. We build proprietary technology and
  human in the loop workflows to radically enhance the lawyer
  machine relationship. Our mission is to review complex
  documents faster than ever and with perfect quality
  
  Crosby was founded by Ryan (Penn, Stanford Law, ex Cooley,
  former GC) and John (Penn M&T, ex Ramp, ex Google)
  
  We believe:
  
  - A great legal system is the watermark of a great society.
  - Legal work is art and science. We are discovering the
    frontier between the two— codifying what can be
    systematized, and amplifying human expertise where
    judgment matters most.
  - The right way to deploy AI in law isn’t by selling software.
    It’s by selling outcomes — higher-quality legal work,
    delivered faster and more efficiently
  - In an in-person culture at our NYC office.
  
  The Role
  
  As an Engineer, you will be a full stack owner of the
  intelligent features that power the Crosby platform. You’ll
  be responsible for the entire lifecycle of an AI
  feature—from building the underlying systems to customizing
  the models that make them run. Your work will involve both
  robust system design and the pragmatic application of
  advanced machine learning techniques, including model fine
  tuning when necessary. This role is for a product minded
  engineer who knows how to get the most out of modern AI and
  is obsessed with shipping reliable, high impact features.
  
  What You'll Do
  
  - Build Core AI Systems: Design, build, and scale our primary
    AI features, including complex Retrieval Augmented
    Generation (RAG) pipelines and agentic workflows.
  - Customize Models for Impact: Selectively fine tune and adapt
    language models to improve their performance on highly
    specific legal tasks where off the shelf solutions fall
    short
  - Ensure Production Quality: Develop practical evaluation
    methods and monitoring systems to ensure the reliability,
    accuracy, and efficiency of our AI features in production
  - Apply AI Pragmatically: Stay on the frontier of AI research
    and identify the most effective techniques and tools to
    solve immediate product challenges
  - Collaborate to Ship: Work closely with product, backend, and
    our in house legal experts to deliver end to end solutions
    that make our users more effective
  
  What We're Looking For
  
  - Experience: 3+ years of professional software engineering
    experience, with a focus on building and shipping AI/ML
    powered products.
  - Strong Engineering Foundation: Deep proficiency in Python
    and a proven ability to build scalable, production grade
    systems.
  - Practical AI Skills: Hands on experience building with LLM
    APIs (ex: OpenAI, Anthropic) and familiarity with the
    entire ML project lifecycle
  - Analytical and Pragmatic: You have a data driven approach to
    problem solving and a strong intuition for when to build a
    complex solution versus when to ship a simple one
  - Product Focused: You are driven by user impact and skilled
    at making smart technical trade offs to deliver value
    quickly
  - Ownership: You thrive on taking full responsibility for
    features, from initial concept through to deployment and
    iteration
  
  Ideal Qualifications
  
  - Previous experience in a fast paced, early stage startup
    environment
  
  Why Work at Crosby
  
  - Foundational Impact: As a core member of the team, you will
    shape the intelligent systems, culture, and technical
    direction of the entire company
  - Competitive salary and equity compensation
  - Comprehensive health, dental, and vision insurance
  - Unlimited PTO
  - In person team in NYC with a collaborative, high energy
    environment.
