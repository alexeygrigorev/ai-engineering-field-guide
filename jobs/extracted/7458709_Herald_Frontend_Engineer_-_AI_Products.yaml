  **About Us**
  
  Herald builds digital infrastructure for commercial insurance. Today we provide developers a single API to get quotes for insurance products from multiple carriers. Tomorrow we want to build anything that helps developers connect their applications to the insurance ecosystem. We think buying insurance should be as easy as buying anything else online and we want your help!
  
  We’re a team of insurtech veterans with experience at At-Bay, Kin, and Insurify. We’ve raised our Series A funding from top-tier VCs (Lightspeed, Brewer Lane,  Afore, Underscore) along with a panel of insurtech founders (At-Bay, Marble), insurance executives (CRC), and early employees of other successful API infrastructure companies (Plaid, Alloy, Stytch).
  ****The Role****
  
  We are seeking a highly skilled **Frontend Engineer** to join our team and take ownership of building our application from the ground up. This role requires a strong foundation in modern frontend development, architectural decision-making, and hands-on coding expertise to establish scalable, maintainable solutions.
  ****Key Responsibilities****
  - **Project Ownership**: Lead the development of a new web application from scratch, setting up the architecture, tooling, and best practices.
  
  - **Architecture & Design**: Define and implement frontend architecture, ensuring scalability, performance, and maintainability.
  
  - **Feature Development**: Build robust, user-friendly, and responsive interfaces using React, TypeScript, and modern libraries.
  
  - **Collaboration**: Work closely with product managers, designers, and backend engineers to deliver seamless user experiences.
  
  - **Quality & Testing**: Establish automated testing strategies (unit, integration, end-to-end) to ensure high code quality.
  
  - **Continuous Improvement**: Optimize application performance, maintain CI/CD pipelines, and stay current with industry trends.
  ****What You Bring****
  - **1+ years of professional experience** in frontend development with strong expertise in React.
  
  - Experience building production web applications and contributing to project setup or new feature development.
  
  - Proficiency in **TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), and/or modern React (Hooks, Context, etc.)**.
  
  - Interface with our **Python Flask** backend to integrate APIs, debug data flows, and extend functionality as needed.
  
  - Write backend logic and make **Postgres** queries to support frontend features.
  
  - Familiarity with **styling libraries and UI frameworks** such as TailwindCSS, Material UI, Styled Components, or **Storybook** for component-driven development.
  
  - Excitement to contribute in a fast-paced startup environment and help take products from 0→1.
  ****Nice to Have****
  - Experience with **Next.js** or other SSR frameworks.
  
  - Background in **cloud platforms** (AWS, GCP, Azure) and DevOps practices.
  
  - Knowledge of **micro-frontend architectures** and integration strategies.

  **Life at Herald**
  
  We're just getting started and building our culture with purpose every day. One of the joys of joining a small company early is that you get to build that culture too. Come join us and help us make Herald an (even more) amazing place to work!
  
  **Actions we value****
  
  There are many actions that we hope for and even demand from members of our team: communicating honestly, working hard, behaving with integrity. These are expectations. But we value these five actions above and beyond the level of "baseline expectation." We believe that if we excel at these, our business will thrive. We’re betting the company on it.
  ****Build trust ****
  
  We always lead with empathy. We publicly own and learn from our mistakes just as we are confident and transparent in explaining our decisions. And we help get the work done because we recognize that no job is too small.
  ****Create a shared reality****
  
  We each articulate the facts, assumptions, questions, and fears we hold about our business. We listen to and learn from others. We create a shared set of information before making decisions.
  ****Get better every day.****
  
  We constantly seek ways to improve ourselves. We provide each other candid feedback coupled with support to elevate those around us. We refine how we work together to become more effective as a team.
  ****Build a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community.****
  
  We thrive when our team has a variety of lived experiences, values each other for their unique perspectives, and shares equitably in our mutual success. We invest in building an inclusive community for people who are oppressed because of their race, ethnicity, age, religion, gender expression, sexual orientation, physical ability, or socio-economic class.
  ****(Remember that) we make the rules.****
  
  We once created the ways we work and therefore can change them. We do not default to momentum. We challenge ourselves to deconstruct the status quo and create a better future.
