  Rockerbox is building the next generation of marketing
  intelligence, and we’re looking for someone to help us build
  the AI systems everyone else just theorizes about. As a
  Staff AI Data Engineer, you’ll research, design, and
  architect data systems purpose-built for AI agents,
  automations, and decisioning engines. You’ll also apply data
  science and model-tuning techniques to optimize LLMs and
  solve complex marketing challenges for our clients.
  
  If you enjoy turning high-volume data into clean, powerful
  systems—and you want your work to drive real business
  outcomes rather than just dashboards—this role puts you
  right at the center of the action.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Apply bleeding edge AI theory to the design and
    implementation of large-scale data systems that feed AI
    agents and autonomous workflows.
  - Use data science techniques to fine-tune, evaluate, and
    optimize LLMs for marketing-specific tasks: attribution
    insights, anomaly detection, summarization,
    classification, and automated recommendations.
  - Build end-to-end automations using LLMs, internal data, and
    external signals to eliminate repetitive human tasks.
  - Build AI-driven automations that reduce manual work across
    Rockerbox and unlock new client-facing capabilities.
  - Design retrieval, orchestration, and memory layers that make
    our AI agents smarter over time.
  - Establish best practices for AI data quality, observability,
    experiments, and safety.
  - Lead R&D initiatives: rapid prototyping, experimentation,
    model evaluations, and productionization.
  - Mentor data scientists and engineers across organization to
    raise the bar on LLM use company-wide.
  
  What You Bring
  
  - 8+ years of experience in data engineering, AI, ML
    platforms, or large-scale distributed systems.
  - Hands-on experience integrating LLMs into production systems
    (OpenAI, fine-tuning, embeddings, RAG, vector stores, or
    custom agent orchestration).
  - Strong understanding of experimentation, model evaluation,
    and performance tuning.
  - You think in systems: storage, retrieval, metadata,
    reliability, latency, failure modes.
  - Ability to work from ambiguity to execution — you’re
    comfortable being the first to figure something out.
  - Strong communication skills: you can explain tradeoffs,
    scope decisions, and technical strategy clearly.
  
  The successful candidate’s starting salary will be
  determined based on a number of non-discriminating factors,
  including qualifications for the role, level, skills,
  experience, location, and balancing internal equity relative
  to peers at DV. The estimated salary range for this role
  based on the qualifications set forth in the job description
  is between [$128,000 - $230,000]. This role will also be
  eligible for bonus/commission (as applicable), equity, and
  benefits. The range above is for the expectations as laid
  out in the job description; however, we are often open to a
  wide variety of profiles, and recognize that the person we
  hire may be more or less experienced than this job
  description as posted. Why You’ll Love Rockerbox: At
  Rockerbox, you’ll find a fast-paced, results-driven
  environment where your work has a direct impact on our
  growth and the success of our clients. Our iterative
  development process means you’ll see your contributions come
  to life quickly. You’ll join a supportive, light-hearted
  team that values collaboration and innovation. We are
  committed to professional growth and will actively support
  your development in both technical and business domains.
  
  
  Not-so-fun fact: Research shows that while men apply to jobs
  when they meet an average of 60% of job criteria, women and
  other marginalized groups tend to only apply when they check
  every box. So if you think you have what it takes but you’re
  not sure that you check every box, apply anyway!
