  and we've built a fearlessly experimental, endlessly
  curious, customer obsessed team who work together and help
  organizations around the world turn their unstructured data
  into insights instantly.
  
  Why Instabase?
  
  This role places you at the forefront of the Generative AI
  revolution, empowering you to build transformative solutions
  for the world’s largest enterprises.
  
  Our Go-To-Market (GTM) team own the end-to-end customer
  experience solving problems with Instabase - discovering the
  right problems, demonstrating solutions, proving value, and
  launching to production.
  
  The Opportunity We are redefining the traditional Sales
  Engineering role. At Instabase, we are moving beyond static
  software to dynamic AI workforces. As a Sales Engineer,
  Applied AI, you will be the bridge between complex business
  inefficiencies and our no-code AI automation platform. You
  won’t just demonstrate features; you will architect
  intelligent workflows that transform unstructured data into
  action.
  
  You will partner with Account Executives to lead the
  technical sales motion, but your “weapon of choice” isn’t a
  code editor—it’s our powerful AI Hub and Workflow
  Orchestrator.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Strategic Solutioning: Partner with Account Executives to
    uncover high-value customer pains. You will translate
    these into business requirements then into concrete AI
    automation designs using our platform.
  - Build to Win: Design and configure compelling Proofs of
    Concept (POCs). You will leverage our drag-and-drop
    workflow builders and  our collaboration AI toolsets to
    show customers their own data being processed in real-
    time.
  - Applied AI Advisory: Act as a trusted advisor on “The Art of
    the Possible.” You will educate customers on prompt
    engineering best practices, agentic workflows, and how to
    govern AI safely, without needing to discuss low-level
    model weights.
  - Champion the User Experience: Because you are pushing the
    boundaries of our no-code tools, you will be the primary
    feedback loop to Product Management, helping us refine the
    user interface and agent capabilities.
  
  What You Bring
  
  - Hybrid DNA: You have the technical chops of a software
    engineer and the communication skills of a consultant. You
    are as comfortable in a Jupyter Notebook as you are in a
    boardroom.
  - Applied AI Fluency: 3+ years of experience building or
    deploying AI/ML solutions. You understand the functional
    application of LLMs. You know how to prompt a model to get
    the best result (Prompt Engineering) and understand the
    practicalities of Generative AI, LLMs (GPT, Gemini,
    Anthropic), and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
  - Technical Storytelling: Proven track record in a customer-
    facing role (Solutions Consultant, Sales Engineer, or
    Business Analyst). You excel at simplifying complex AI
    concepts for non-technical stakeholders.
  - Data Literacy: You are comfortable working with unstructured
    data (documents, emails, chats) and understand the nuance
    of extracting structured value from it.
  - Sales Engineering Excellence: Proven track record in a
    customer-facing technical role (Sales Engineering,
    Solutions Architecture, or Forward Deployed Engineering).
    You know how to map technical features to business value.
  - Problem Solving: You love unstructured problems. You can
    look at a messy dataset (invoices, medical records,
    financial statements) and instantly visualize the AI
    pipeline needed to structure it.
  - Education: Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer
    Science, Engineering, Mathematics, or equivalent practical
    experience.
  
  Compensation: For US-based roles: The base salary range for
  this role is $157,000 to $175,000 + commission, equity, and
  benefits. The actual pay may vary based on factors such as
  location, experience/skills, and level of impact the
  individual is expected to make at Instabase.
  
  US Benefits:
  
  - Flexible PTO: Because life is better when you actually live
    it!
  - Instabreak Fridays: Enjoy 6 company-wide Friday breaks
    scheduled throughout the year, giving you long weekends to
    relax and recharge!
  - Comprehensive Coverage: Top-notch medical, dental, and
    vision insurance.
  - 401(k) with Matching: We’ve got your back for a secure
    future.
  - Parental Leave & Fertility Benefits: Supporting you in
    growing your family, your way.
  - Therapy Sessions Covered: Mental health matters— 10 free
    sessions through Samata Health.
  - Wellness Stipend: For gym memberships, fitness tech, or
    whatever keeps you thriving.
  - Lunch on Us: Enjoy a lunch credit when you're in the office.
