  This is Adyen
  
  Adyen provides payments, data, and financial products in a
  single solution for customers like Meta, Uber, H&M, and
  Microsoft - making us the financial technology platform of
  choice. At Adyen, everything we do is engineered for
  ambition.
  
  For our teams, we create an environment with opportunities
  for our people to succeed, backed by the culture and support
  to ensure they are enabled to truly own their careers. We
  are motivated individuals who tackle unique technical
  challenges at scale and solve them as a team. Together, we
  deliver innovative and ethical solutions that help
  businesses achieve their ambitions faster.
  
  The Opportunity
  
  Adyen is building a top-tier AI research engineering team to
  drive our next chapter of innovation using AI across the
  entire company. This is a highly technical, hands-on
  leadership role focused on translating cutting-edge AI
  research into robust, scalable, and production-ready
  applications within the financial technology sector. As a
  Staff Level Research Engineer, you'll operate with a high
  degree of autonomy and responsibility, delivering strategic,
  high-impact outcomes that bridge the gap between advanced AI
  research and global-scale production systems. Our AI
  research efforts are expanding, with ML scientists in
  Amsterdam collaborating on significant projects that could
  impact trillions of dollars in transactions annually.
  
  What you’ll do:
  
  - Drive the execution of Adyen's AI research strategy,
    focusing on the practical application of Generative AI
    (GenAI) and other AI methodologies in finance. This
    includes contributing to Adyen's efforts in key research
    areas such as AI agents for data analysis and operational
    workflows, human-in-the-loop research for Integrity Risk,
    and potentially foundational model development. For
    instance, you might contribute to initiatives like the
    Data Agent Benchmark for Multi-step Reasoning (DABstep),
    which evaluates AI agents on real-world data analysis
    tasks, including those from the financial sector.
  - Bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and
    production by rapidly prototyping AI features and
    implementing research papers into robust, scalable, and
    production-ready code that delivers measurable business
    value.
  - Contribute to defining the long-term vision for AI at Adyen,
    specifically how AI will interact with humans and finance,
    including consumers, merchants, and financial
    institutions. This also includes understanding regulation
    and advocating for safe innovation in the field.
  - Drive innovation by challenging the status quo, introducing
    transformative ideas, and leveraging technologies and
    methodologies to improve solutions that align with company
    strategy.
  - Carry out flexible, value-driven assignments, proactively
    unblocking teams, moving between teams or scopes as needed
    to maximize organizational impact and drive strategic
    initiatives.
  - Provide technical mentorship and sponsorship to engineers
    across the organization, fostering collaboration to share
    knowledge and best practices, and cultivating a culture of
    continuous improvement through deep engagement in problem-
    solving and hands-on guidance.
  - Connect with the broader AI community (including startups,
    VCs, and AI labs) to stay informed of the latest
    advancements and identify potential partnership
    opportunities.
  - Champion engineering and scientific alignment, advocate for
    high-quality standards, and drive the reduction of
    complexity and dependencies across teams.
  - Actively pair with engineers to solve deep-rooted technical
    challenges and be fully capable of being hands-on with the
    code, whether creating proof-of-concepts or fixing
    critical performance issues.
  
  Who you are:
  
  - You have 10+ years of professional experience in software
    engineering, machine learning, or applied research, with a
    proven ability to drive high-impact initiatives end-to-
    end.
  - You are deeply plugged into the scientific AI research
    community and have a strong understanding of the latest
    advancements in AI, especially Generative AI (GenAI) and
    Large Language Models (LLMs).
  - You possess a proven ability to take cutting-edge AI
    research papers and implement them into production-
    quality, scalable code.
  - You demonstrate a strong engineering mindset with a track
    record of writing clean, efficient, and scalable code
    suitable for production environments.
  - You excel at translating complex technical concepts into
    clear, understandable terms for diverse audiences,
    including engineers, executives, and during public events.
    You adapt your communication style to effectively engage
    with diverse audiences.
  - You demonstrate the ability to think critically and deliver
    simple and elegant solutions to complex, cross-team
    problems, influencing strategic direction and fostering
    innovation across the organization.
  - You excel in soft skills such as empathy, influence,
    negotiation, relationship building, and conflict
    resolution.
  
  Nice to haves:
  
  - Experience in AI-enabled fintech or infrastructure
    companies.
  - Familiarity with classical machine learning or
    infrastructure concepts.
  - Experience with external visibility activities such as
    conferences and publications.
  - A strong product sense and the ability to identify impactful
    AI use cases.
  - Experience working with on-premise infrastructure.
