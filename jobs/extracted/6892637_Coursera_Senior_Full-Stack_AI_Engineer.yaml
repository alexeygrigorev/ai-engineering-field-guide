  **Why Join Us**
  
  At Coursera, we’re looking for inventors, innovators, and lifelong learners ready to shape the future of education. You’ll help build global programs and tools that power online learning for millions turning bold ideas into real impact. People who thrive here are customer-first builders who move fast, simplify ruthlessly, and iterate relentlessly on the metrics that matter. 
  
  We’re a globally distributed team and let you choose the best way you work, whether it's from home, a Coursera hub, or a co-working space near you. Our virtual hiring and onboarding make it easy to join us and start making an impact from anywhere. If you’re ready to make a global impact, scale unique products exclusive to Coursera, and expand your career horizons, apply below.
  
  **Job Overview:**
  
  We’re seeking a Senior Full-Stack AI Engineer to join a small, cross-functional team focused on building AI-native learning experiences from the ground up. This is a high-impact role where you’ll create innovative, personalized learning features, experiment with new AI capabilities, and move fast from concept to prototype to production.
  
  You’ll work closely with designers, product managers, and other engineers in a maker-driven environment where everyone contributes directly to building the product. The role emphasizes practical use of Generative AI—both in the features we ship and in how you work every day.
  
  This role is an in-person role in our Mountain View office 3 days a week. 
  
  **Responsibilities:**
  
  - Build and ship full-stack features using React (or similar), Node.js, and Python.
  
  - Create AI-driven learning experiences—including hyper-personalization, adaptive content, and intelligent assistance—by leveraging Generative AI frameworks, APIs, and orchestration tools.
  
  - Use AI proactively in your development workflow for scaffolding, refactoring, and testing code—while critically reviewing AI-generated output for quality and performance.
  
  - Rapidly prototype, test, and iterate on ideas based on user feedback.
  
  - Collaborate across disciplines to integrate AI capabilities into seamless, intuitive user experiences.
  
  - Implement and maintain robust testing, deployment, and monitoring for AI-enabled features.
  
  **Why You’ll Love This Role**
  
  - **Impact**: Help shape the future of personalized education for millions of learners worldwide.
  
  - **Velocity**: Work in a fast-moving environment with short iteration cycles and room for bold experimentation.
  
  - **Innovation**: Build AI-native features and workflows from scratch, unencumbered by legacy constraints.
  
  - **Culture**: Join a collaborative, hands-on team where your ideas can go from sketch to shipped in weeks.
  
  **Qualifications:**
  
  - 5 + years of professional experience in full-stack development (React/Next.js, Node.js, Python) and working with cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure).
  
  - Knowledge of Generative AI concepts and experience applying them to create practical, user-facing applications.
  
  - Hands-on experience using AI coding assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT) to speed up development without compromising quality.
  
  - Understanding of RESTful API design, databases (SQL/NoSQL), and modern application architectures.
  
  - Bonus: familiarity with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), embeddings, or vector databases.
  
  - Strong communication skills, curiosity, and a passion for pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in online learning.

  Zone 1: $160,000 - 235,000
