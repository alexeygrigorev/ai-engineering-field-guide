  About Applico Capital
  
  Applico Capital is the leading venture capital firm focused
  on the $8 trillion B2B distribution industry. Through our
  learnings and understanding of the industry, we are building
  a tech startup, currently in stealth, to solve the
  industry's biggest problems as it comes to unlocking AI-
  enabled synergies.
  
  Our mandate is to leverage AI and modern technologies to
  reimagine the role of the traditional distributor and
  transform how the entire industry operates.
  
  We are looking for highly technical builders who thrive in
  entrepreneurial, scrappy, and collaborative environments.
  
  About the Role
  
  We’re seeking an AI Engineer to design, build, and deploy
  machine learning and generative AI systems that drive
  tangible impact across core business operations.
  
  You’ll work hands-on to turn prototypes into production
  systems, embedding AI into products and workflows to improve
  everything from search and merchandising to pricing,
  forecasting, and customer support.
  
  This is a deeply technical, highly autonomous role in a
  startup-style team working directly with stable enterprises
  as design partners. You’ll move fast, automate aggressively,
  and deliver measurable value — while partnering closely with
  data engineers, scientists, and product teams to ensure
  systems are reliable, safe, and trusted.
  
  You’ll also be expected to leverage AI-augmented engineering
  practices (LLM copilots, code generation, automated testing)
  and explore agentic architectures that enable autonomous and
  semi-autonomous business workflows.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Build and maintain end-to-end ML and AI pipelines, including
    training, testing, deployment, and monitoring
  - Partner with AI Scientists to translate prototypes and
    research models into scalable, production-ready systems
  - Develop APIs and microservices to integrate AI capabilities
    directly into business applications and workflows
  - Implement automation, testing, and monitoring for
    reliability, performance, and reproducibility
  - Collaborate with Data and MLOps teams to ensure scalability,
    observability, and cost optimization
  - Apply AI-augmented development tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot,
    GPTs, automated testing agents) to accelerate engineering
    velocity
  - Experiment with and operationalize agentic frameworks
    (LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, N8N, etc.) to orchestrate
    intelligent, tool-using systems
  - Ensure AI systems are governed, observable, and aligned with
    responsible AI principles
  
  Why Join Us
  
  - Build real, production-grade AI systems — not demos —
    embedded in major operating businesses
  - Work alongside leaders in data architecture, automation, and
    applied AI
  - Operate with the autonomy and speed of a startup, backed by
    the resources of a large, stable enterprise
  - Help define how responsible, interoperable, and open AI
    systems reshape industrial B2B commerce
  
  Requirements
  
  - 5+ years in software engineering or data engineering, with
    applied ML experience
  - Proficiency in Python and modern ML frameworks (PyTorch,
    TensorFlow, or JAX)
  - Strong experience with cloud-native ML platforms (AWS, GCP,
    or Azure) and modern data systems
  - Familiarity with MLOps practices (CI/CD for ML, feature
    stores, model registries, monitoring)
  - Proven ability to deliver production-grade ML systems that
    create measurable business impact
  - Hands-on experience using AI copilots or agent
    frameworks/orchestration layers (LangChain, AutoGen,
    CrewAI, N8N, etc.) preferred
  - Bonus: familiarity with retrieval-augmented generation
    (RAG), vector databases, or multi-agent systems
industries:
  - Artificial Intelligence
  - Information Technology
  - Software
