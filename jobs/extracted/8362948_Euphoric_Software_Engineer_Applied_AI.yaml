  About Euphoric:
  
  Euphoric builds AI-first employee benefits administration
  software for the world’s largest and most prestigious
  employers. Born out of Peppy Health — a fast-growing,
  category-defining Series B startup — we spun out in May 2025
  to tackle a far bigger opportunity.
  
  Global employers spend $3–5 trillion on benefits every year.
  It’s their second-largest cost after payroll — yet the
  entire category is still running on legacy systems and
  outdated assumptions. The space is primed for
  transformation: despite its scale, it’s been almost
  completely overlooked by AI-first startups. Incumbents —
  including one U.S. heavyweight with $2B+ in annual revenue —
  are constrained by archaic tech stacks and can’t move fast
  enough to innovate.
  
  And this isn’t just a massive market — it’s genuine “tech
  for good.” Smarter benefits administration, richer
  analytics, and clearer communication have the power to
  directly improve the everyday lives, wellbeing, and
  financial security of millions of employees worldwide.
  
  We’re a sharp, high-velocity team with bold ambitions,
  obsessed with building category-defining technology and
  partnering with exceptional people who want their work to
  truly matter.
  
  We closed our seed round in October 2025 and are building
  from a position of strength with a long cash runway.
  
  The role:
  
  We’re looking for a Software Engineer to bring their
  ambition, creativity, and technical prowess to join our
  high-powered team to build the technology that powers the
  world’s first lovable, AI-native benefits platform.
  
  You’ll have real ownership, big targets, and a chance to
  help shape both the work you do and the company in general.
  We care less about traditional career paths and more about
  raw talent, bias for action, and how much fire you bring.
  What you’ll do:
  
  - Build AI-first features end-to-end: You’ll contribute to the
    design, deployment, and iteration of our next-generation
    benefits platform features that leverage personalization,
    experimentation, and AI/ML methods (e.g. agents/LLMs,
    recommender systems, reinforcement learning) to enhance
    user experience in a meaningful business domain.
  - Contribute across the tech stack: You’ll work in React
    (JavaScript/TypeScript) on the frontend and Python
    (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy) on the backend, shipping production-
    ready code and user-facing features in addition to
    innovative ML work.
  - Live on the cutting edge of AI tooling: You’ll help push the
    boundary of what’s feasible with modern AI-powered
    software development tools (Cursor, Windsurf), keep up
    with the regular drumbeat of AI advances, and find new and
    exciting ways to build and explore new features faster.
  - Participate in a fast-paced iterative environment:
    Collaborate closely with design, product, and beyond to
    deliver and iterate on impressive features and prototypes
    at world-class pace.
  - Keep code clean and well-tested: Maintain clean, efficient,
    and tested code with clear documentation for both peers
    and future reference.
  - Review, refine, and grow: Actively participate in peer
    reviews, CI/CD processes, and a growth-minded engineering
    culture, where you continuously seek to level up your
    technical skills.
  - Be a team player: Sometimes you’ll be iterating on ML
    pipelines; other times you’ll be refining a frontend
    component or fixing a tricky bug. We need someone who’s
    excited about the full product journey and moving together
    as one.
  
  Skills & experience:
  
  - Industry Experience (2+ years): Prior experience
    contributing to impactful products in fast-paced or
    startup environments, with an understanding of both scale
    and quality from larger tech organizations.
  - Hands-On Full Stack Skills: Proficiency in React/Typescript
    and/or Python (RESTful APIs, data pipelines), plus comfort
    with deploying and maintaining services on modern cloud
    platforms (GCP preferred, AWS or Azure also fine).
  - Applied AI/ML Skills: First-hand experience building and
    delivering AI/ML features to real users, and an insatiable
    curiosity to keep up with emerging technologies and trends
  - Team-Oriented Mindset: Strong communication skills for
    explaining complex ideas to technical and non-technical
    audiences, and a passion for collaborating within cross-
    functional teams.
  - Passion and Pride in Shipping: A do-whatever-it-takes
    attitude to deliver against important business goals that
    help the entire team win
  - Pragmatic Best Practices: An overarching desire to build
    efficient, scalable, and maintainable code, while learning
    the tradeoffs between technical debt and delivery speed
  
  What we look for:
  
  We’re a great bunch but we have some "Euph" cultural non-
  negotiables. To do well here you will:
  
  - Thrive in fast-paced, feedback-rich environments
  - Take your work seriously, but not yourself
  - Be proactive, playful, and deeply curious
  - Want to build something that matters
  - Be willing to “do what it takes”
  
  What you’ll get:
  
  - Salary between £90k - £110k dependent on experience
  - Remote-first setup with optional shared work space pass and
    hubs in London (We will only consider UK or Europe based
    candidates, with a preference for those closer to London)
  - Apple devices and the best AI tooling
  - Private healthcare via Vitality
  - 3% employer pension contribution (min 3% employee
    contribution)
  - Meaningful early-stage share opportunities
  - 25 days holiday per year, plus bank holidays
  - Career rocket fuel - real growth, real ownership, real
    impact
