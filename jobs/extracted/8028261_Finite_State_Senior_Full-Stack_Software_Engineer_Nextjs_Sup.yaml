description: |
  Finite State partners with product security teams, the
  guardians of our connected world, to create transparency for
  their connected devices and supply chains. Our platform
  handles connected devices and embedded systems across all
  industries, including those found in enterprises,
  healthcare, utilities, connected vehicles, manufacturing
  facilities, critical infrastructure, and government
  entities.
  
  We are a fast-growing series-B company with a fully
  distributed workforce. Led by a team of seasoned experts, we
  are a mission-driven team passionate about arming our
  customers with the actionable insights, critical
  vulnerability data, and remediation guidance necessary to
  mitigate product risk and protect the connected attack
  surface. We are committed to a remote first culture.
  
  The Role
  
  We’re looking for a Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer with
  deep expertise in Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL/Supabase,
  and AI-assisted development to design, build, and deliver
  the scalable, secure systems behind our cybersecurity
  platform.
  
  This is a hands-on, product-focused role for an engineer
  who:
  
  - Thrives at the intersection of secure software engineering,
    data-heavy systems, and product innovation
  - Is fluent in AI tooling (Cursor, Devin, Copilot, etc.) and
    knows how to turn them into real velocity — not toys
  - Can design full-stack solutions, think strategically about
    risk and performance, and help us move business logic
    closer to the data layer (Postgres + Supabase)
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Full-Stack Development: Build and maintain secure, scalable
    web applications using Next.js/React, TypeScript, and Node
    – backed by PostgreSQL on Supabase (and AWS RDS during
    migration). Own features end-to-end from UI to database.
  - Database-Centric Application Logic: Design and implement
    business logic close to the data using Postgres functions,
    views, triggers, Row-Level Security (RLS), and Supabase
    Edge Functions, minimizing unnecessary middleware and
    enabling high performance and strong data isolation.
  - AI-Accelerated Development: Treat tools like Cursor, Devin,
    GitHub Copilot, and agent frameworks as core parts of your
    workflow. You'll use them to scaffold and refactor full-
    stack features, generate and evolve schemas, migrations,
    and RLS policies and build internal agents that automate
    repetitive engineering tasks and glue systems together
  - Application Security First: Embed security best practices
    into every layer of development — from secure coding and
    dependency management to data protection and
    authentication/authorization (Supabase Auth, OAuth2/OIDC,
    SSO). Collaborate with security researchers to ensure
    features align with threat models.
  - Product Collaboration: Work hand-in-hand with product
    managers and designers to translate customer pain points
    into impactful, intuitive features. Participate in product
    discovery and help shape roadmaps with a strong technical
    and data-informed perspective.
  - Architect & Scale: Design and optimize API contracts, edge
    endpoints, and event flows using Next.js (server
    components, API routes) and Supabase (Edge Functions,
    real-time). Consider performance, resiliency, and multi-
    region deployment (read replicas, data partitioning) as
    first-class concerns.
  - Data Expertise: Model and optimize relational data in
    PostgreSQL for large, multi-tenant workloads. Own indexing
    strategies, query performance, and data partitioning
    approaches to support 10x–30x growth in customers and
    data.
  - Security-Integrated DevOps: Support automated testing, CI/CD
    pipelines, database migrations, and vulnerability scanning
    throughout the development lifecycle. Work closely with
    infrastructure engineers on Supabase + AWS environments,
    observability, and performance tuning.
  - Mentorship & Collaboration: Provide guidance and thoughtful
    code reviews to peers, fostering a culture of quality,
    security, and ownership. Help raise the bar on full-stack,
    data-centric, and AI-native engineering practices.
  - Continuous Learning: Stay ahead of trends in AI-assisted
    engineering, agentic systems, application security,
    Next.js, and modern Postgres/Supabase practices, and share
    what you learn with the team.
  
  What We’re Looking for
  
  - Senior Full-Stack Engineer with experience building and
    shipping production web apps using Next.js/React,
    TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and a Node-based backend
  - AI-native developer who regularly uses AI-assisted dev tools
    (e.g., Cursor, Copilot, Devin) to move faster, improve
    code quality, and explore design options, and knows when
    to verify output
  - Strong backend and data modeling skills in Postgres;
    experience with Supabase (Auth, RLS, Edge Functions,
    migrations) or similar Postgres-based platforms is a plus
  - Security-conscious engineer with a solid understanding of
    secure web application development,
    authentication/authorization, and modern security best
    practices; familiarity with software supply chain security
    or interest in learning quickly
  - Experience deploying and operating applications in the cloud
    (ideally AWS), with working knowledge of Docker, CI/CD,
    and modern managed or serverless platforms
  - Product-minded and collaborative, balancing technical rigor
    with user and business needs, caring about testing and
    maintainability, and communicating clearly in a remote,
    cross-functional team
  
  Your 90-Day Success Path
  
  - 30 Days: Ship small full-stack features in our Next.js +
    Supabase stack; learn our security and data architecture;
    demonstrate effective use of AI tools + agentic workflows
    in your day-to-day work.
  - 60 Days: Own and deliver secure, high-impact features end-
    to-end; contribute to schema and API design; help refine
    patterns for RLS, migrations, edge functions, and internal
    AI/agent tooling.
  - 90 Days: Lead new initiatives, drive improvements in
    performance and security posture, shape our full-stack and
    AI-native architecture, and mentor peers on Next.js,
    Supabase, and AI-accelerated development.
