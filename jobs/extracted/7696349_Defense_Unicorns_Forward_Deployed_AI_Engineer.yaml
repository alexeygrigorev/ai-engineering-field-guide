  EMPLOYER IS A CONTRACTOR FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THIS
  POSITION REQUIRES U.S. CITIZENSHIP.
  
  About Defense Unicorns
  
  Defense Unicorns is veteran-founded and mission-driven. The
  company’s vision is to advance freedom and independence
  globally by transforming how the U.S. Department of War
  builds, buys, delivers, and sustains software. We deliver
  secure, scalable software and AI solutions that function in
  cloud, on-prem, and tactical edge / air-gapped environments
  — making software a strategic deterrent for warfighters.
  
  In this role you will join a team building the backbone of
  modern defense software delivery — helping ensure
  warfighters can deploy the latest capabilities rapidly,
  securely, and reliably.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Embed with strategic customers as a technical partner,
    working from problem discovery to solution implementation
    and customer adoption.
  - Architect, build, deploy, and operate agentic Generative AI
    systems: APIs, data processing ETL pipelines, integration
    layers, Retrieval Augmented Generation, and context
    engineering.
  - Work in cloud, on-prem, and edge/air-gapped environments to
    ensure software can run where the mission demands.
  - Prototype and deploy systems leveraging the core products
    and design patterns of the Unicorn Delivery Service (UDS);
    bring back insights from the field for continuous product
    improvement .
  - Scope, sequence, and lead delivery of solutions: define
    living roadmaps, set priorities, trade off speed vs
    quality vs scope, work across internal teams and customer
    stakeholders to drive clarity and remove blockers early.
  - Codify reusable patterns for mission environments: build
    tools, internal frameworks, playbooks so future
    deployments are faster, safer, and repeatable.
  - Act as the technical face to customer leadership:
    communicate effectively with both technical and non-
    technical stakeholders, build trust, manage expectations,
    and ensure successful scale and mission adoption.  This is
    a customer-facing role.
  - Ability and interest to travel up to 25%, as needed to
    client sites, but flexible based on personal preferences.
  
  What You’ll Bring
  
  - 3+ years of engineering or technical deployment experience
    (backend or full-stack), ideally in customer-facing or
    government environments (DoD, intelligence, public sector)
    or analogous high-assurance contexts.
  - Strong backend engineering skills: production-grade code in
    Python or TypeScript; deep familiarity with designing
    services, APIs, data pipelines, integrations, and backend
    frameworks.
  - Familiarity with LLMs or generative AI systems — be able to
    explain the fundamentals of Context Engineering and
    understand how model behavior connects to product/mission
    experience, and how AI capabilities integrate into larger
    system architectures.
  - Strong ability to work in ambiguity: define scope, sequence
    work, make trade-offs between speed, quality, and scope;
    remove blockers; deliver under pressure in dynamic
    mission-driven settings.
  - Excellent communication skills: able to translate complex
    technical details into clear messaging for non-technical
    stakeholders; work cross-functionally; build relationships
    with customers and internal teams.
  - Mission-oriented mindset.  Have an understanding that our
    work is supporting the defense and freedom of the nation.
  - U.S. Citizenship required; active TS/SCI clearance or
    eligibility strongly preferred.
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Experience with deploying applications on Kubernetes inside
    of air-gapped or secure environments.
  - Experience with Information Retrieval fundamentals including
    knowledge of keyword and vector based search, document
    parsing and chunking, document reranking, and SQL/NoSQL
    search engines.
  - Experience with developing, executing, and maintaining LLM
    evaluations.
  - Experience with open source LLM or SLM models (Llama3,
    Mixtral, Gemma, Phi) including inference frameworks,
    structured output, fine-tuning, and model architecture
    reconfiguration.
  
  Why This Role Matters
  
  As a Forward Deployed AI Engineer at Defense Unicorns, you
  will directly contribute to accelerating warfighter
  capability. By working at the intersection of backend
  software engineering, secure delivery platforms, and
  mission-driven deployments, you’ll help deliver software
  updates in minutes instead of months — enabling operational
  advantage, agility, and freedom for the nation. You will not
  just build code — you’ll deploy impact where it matters
  most.

  experience. Compensation ranges are established using
  national benchmarking data and apply across all geographic
