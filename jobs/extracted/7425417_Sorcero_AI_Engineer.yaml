  THE ROLE
  
  We are looking for an AI Engineer with experience in
  enterprise SaaS environments, with a focus on Generative AI
  and Data Science skills. The ideal candidate will have
  experience leading cross-functional product teams designing,
  building, and training AI-powered services for processing
  complex data in the life sciences domain.
  
  You will tackle some of our most critical AI challenges:
  
  - Collaborating with subject matter experts and cross-
    functional product teams to design and build robust
    pipelines using cloud infrastructure for ingesting and
    processing both structured and unstructured data from
    diverse life sciences sources.
  - Developing and implementing transparent and explainable AI
    systems that maintain scientific accuracy while delivering
    insights that medical professionals can trust and act
    upon.
  - Creating domain-specific AI solutions that can address the
    complexity of medical and scientific language with high
    precision, balancing the power of cutting-edge AI with the
    need for regulatory compliance and scientific rigor in
    healthcare applications.
  
  The primary languages, services, and frameworks that the
  candidate would be expected to work with frequently: Python,
  Jupyter Notebooks, pytest, Poetry, PostgreSQL, Big Query,
  Vertex AI, Google Cloud Storage, PyTorch, and LLMs within
  Google's Model Garden. Sorcero is an agile startup on the
  bleeding edge of current AI advancements, including LLMs,
  RAG and Agentic Frameworks. Experience with deploying and
  maintaining LLM-based systems and frameworks used for them
  (such as LangChain and LlamaIndex) is a bonus, as is the
  ability to learn new technologies quickly.
  
  The ideal candidate will be a collaborative team player who
  can lead execution to build innovative AI solutions. You
  will be expected to contribute to the decision-making
  process and influence the design of our services, bringing

  applications. Our products are innovative and so is our
  team. This is a great opportunity for someone looking to
  contribute meaningfully and learn while having fun in the
  process.
