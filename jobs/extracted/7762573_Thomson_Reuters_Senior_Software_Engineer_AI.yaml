  - Optimize AI performance through advanced techniques, including domain-specific adaptation and fine-tuning of third-party models and algorithms. 
  
  - Integrate AI components within a modern software stack (.NET, Azure, Angular) to deliver robust, secure, and performant features inside Contract Express. 
  
  - Design and implement continuous monitoring of application and user behavior to generate product insights, inform prioritization, and improve AI-driven experiences.

  - Stay abreast of AI developments (with a focus on LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation, and prompt engineering) and promote the learning and adoption of relevant technologies within the team. 
  
  - Act as a thought leader by contributing to internal forums, representing the team in areas of AI expertise, mentoring other engineers, and influencing the broader technical direction. 
  
  About You** **You are a fit for the role if you have: 
  
  - Solid, hands-on experience building and deploying AI/ML solutions in production environments. 
  
  - Strong software engineering background, ideally with experience in:

  - Azure cloud services (e.g., App Services, Functions, Storage, AI-related services) 
  
  - Frontend development with Angular or similar frameworks 
  
  - Practical experience with MLOps / LLMOps practices (CI/CD for models, experiment tracking, monitoring, evaluation, and observability). 
  
  - Experience working with large language models (LLMs) and/or NLP techniques, including integration of third-party AI platforms and services. 
  
  - Proven ability to make sound architectural decisions and to balance innovation with maintainability, security, and performance. 
  
  - A collaborative mindset and strong communication skills, with the ability to partner effectively across disciplines and explain complex AI concepts to non-technical stakeholders. 
  
  - Curiosity and a continuous learning mindset, staying current with the rapidly evolving AI landscape and bringing new ideas back to the team.
