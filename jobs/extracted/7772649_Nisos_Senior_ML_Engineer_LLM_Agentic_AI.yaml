  What Is The Opportunity?
  
  Join an AI/ML team designing and shipping production ML
  systems that combine Large Language Models (LLMs),
  retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and modern agent
  frameworks for multi-step decision making. You will help
  turn massive, noisy data into actionable intelligence for
  analysts and customers.
  
  What Are The Responsibilities?
  
  - Integrate and fine-tune LLMs for natural-language
    understanding, reasoning, and multi-step tool
    orchestration.
  - Build agentic workflows (e.g. using LangGraph) to coordinate
    complex tasks across data sources and services.
  - Architect and implement AI/ML features for pattern
    recognition, entity extraction, and automated intelligence
    gathering at scale.
  - Develop scalable data pipelines and streaming architectures
    that process billions of heterogeneous data points.
  - Create and optimize vector databases and retrieval systems
    for semantic search and RAG.
  - Deliver production-ready APIs and microservices supporting
    real-time analysis and model inference.
  - Own model deployment and monitoring using modern ML/LLMOps
    practices; drive continuous improvement in accuracy,
    latency, and cost.
  - Evaluate LLM systems with offline metrics, golden test sets,
    prompt A/B tests, latency & cost optimisation.
  - Collaborate with analysts and product teams to translate
    intelligence needs into robust ML solutions.
  
  Who You Are
  
  - Expert proficiency in Python, with experience of at least
    one of deep learning frameworks, PyTorch and TensorFlow
  - Hands-on with LangChain, LangGraph, AutoGen or similar agent
    LLM frameworks
  - Deep experience with prompt engineering, foundation model
    API integration and LLM finetuning
  - Expertise in RAG systems with vector databases (Pinecone,
    Weaviate) and embedding technologies
  - Strong experience with LLMOps practices for observability
    and traceability and LLM evaluation.
  - Deep understanding of distributed systems, microservices,
    and real-time streaming architectures
  - Strong containerization and infrastructure skills (Docker,
    ECS, Terraform, CloudFormation)
  - Experience building production AI systems with strong
    safety, privacy, and ethical practices
  - Familiarity with computer vision and NLP techniques for
    OSINT
  - Understanding of adversarial AI and security implications
  
  Required Education and Experience
  
  - Degree in Computer Science, AI/ML, or equivalent experience
  - Substantive experience in building AI/ML products at scale
    with proven experience in LLMs, RAGs or Agentic AI
    solutions
  - Proven experience shipping production AI systems at scale
  - Track record of building systems that process and analyze
    large-scale unstructured data
  - Experience in security, intelligence, or OSINT platforms
    preferred
  
  Where will you work?
  
  - Hybrid office schedule: employees balance working remotely
    and working at our office in Belfast City Centre.
  - Flexible schedule: employees generally work normal business
    hours. We routinely meet in the afternoon with US-based
    colleagues, but we rarely schedule meetings earlier than 8
    am or past 6 pm local time.
  
  What equipment will you use?
  
  The position requires use of Macbooks and MacOS. We ensure
  you can work well from home by providing Macbook Pros,
  monitors, peripherals, and noise-canceling headphones.
