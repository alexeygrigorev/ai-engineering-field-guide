  About Us
  
  This is a fantastic opportunity to join Luminance, the
  pioneer of Legal-Grade™ AI for enterprise. Backed by
  internationally renowned VCs and named in both the Forbes AI
  50 list of ‘Most Promising Private AI Companies in the
  World’ and Inc. 5000’s ‘Fastest Growing Companies in
  America’, Luminance is disrupting the legal profession
  around the globe.
  
  We are looking for an ambitious AI Product Engineer to take
  on end-to-end ownership of high-impact AI tools. This is not
  a narrowly defined development role: the successful
  candidate will act as builder, product thinker, and problem-
  solver, capable of turning ambiguous ideas into deployed,
  business-critical software. A traditional computer science
  degree is not a requirement; we are interested in self-
  starters with the ability to utilise the latest AI tools to
  build at pace.
  
  Key Roles and Responsibilities
  
  - Design, prototype, and ship agentic AI systems that solve
    strategic business problems.
  - Quickly translate abstract requirements into functioning
    prototypes, then sprint to drive them into production use.
  - Debug and resolve complex issues across the stack, from AI
    model behaviour to middleware to deployment configuration.
  - Demo your work across the company and contribute to internal
    narratives around innovation.
  - Produce clear documentation and rollout plans for new tools,
    ensuring adoption by users.
  - Continuously evaluate new AI models, frameworks, and coding
    tools to improve speed and quality.
  
  Requirements
  
  - Demonstrable ability to build and ship AI-enabled products
    or prototypes (professional, academic, or self-taught).
  - Strong problem-solving skills: able to reduce vague,
    underspecified challenges into working code and clear
    workflows.
  - Broad technical literacy: comfortable working with Python,
    APIs, full-stack frameworks, JSON
  - Familiarity with LLMs: understanding their capabilities and
    limitations, and experience integrating them into real
    systems.
  - Excellent communication skills: able to work with
    executives, stakeholders, and non-technical users.
  - Curiosity, persistence, and creativity: willing to
    experiment, iterate, and push through when things don’t
    work first time.
  
  Why Luminance?
  
  - Work at the cutting edge of applied AI in law, one of the
    world’s most impactful domains.
  - Collaborate with a world-class, multidisciplinary team
    spanning law, AI research, and product.
  - Enjoy the autonomy of a startup environment with the backing
    of leading international VCs.
  
  Benefits
  
  - Central London office location.
  - Pension scheme with Aegon, RetireReady.
  - Health insurance with BUPA - all employees are eligible for
    enrolment for themselves and partners and dependents (if
    applicable) from Day 1 with Luminance.
