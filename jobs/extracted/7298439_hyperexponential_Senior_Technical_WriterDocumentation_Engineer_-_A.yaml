  About hyperexponential (hx)
  
  At hyperexponential, we’re building the AI-powered platform
  that enables the world’s most critical decisions in a $7
  trillion industry, which risks to take, and how to price
  them. These are the decisions that shape real-world
  outcomes: whether rockets successfully launch into space,
  autonomous vehicles make it to market, or communities
  recover after major storms.
  
  Until now, insurance has been making billion-dollar
  decisions using outdated tools. We’re changing that. Our
  platform brings together data, AI, and human expertise to
  give insurers the fastest path from submission to decision -
  helping them move faster, act smarter, and take on more risk
  with confidence.
  
  Backed by a16z, Highland Europe, and Battery Ventures, we’re
  scaling globally - already trusted by nearly 50 of the
  world’s largest insurers, with zero churn and billions in
  premiums flowing through hx.
  
  What began as a single product in one market has rapidly
  evolved into a multi-product, multi-territory platform
  powering every stage of pricing and underwriting. AI is at
  the core of what we do - from building the world’s first
  domain-specific AI peer programmer for insurance (think
  GitHub Copilot with a PhD in actuarial science) to shaping
  agentic workflows that reinvent how this industry operates.
  
  What makes hx different is the people who build it. Here,
  impact isn’t tied to title or tenure; it’s defined by the
  challenges you take on and the discipline you bring.
  Surrounded by peers who stretch you, you’ll do the best,
  hardest work of your life in a company engineered to endure.
  
  If that sounds like you, join us in building what comes
  next.
  
  About Technical Writing at hx
  
  At hx, world-class documentation is a product in its own
  right: it drives adoption, enables customer self-service,
  and reduces friction for internal teams. As our products
  scale and our AI agents depend on well-structured knowledge,
  documentation becomes a critical part of how we deliver
  clarity and confidence to users.
  
  This role will sit at the intersection of engineering,
  product, and customer teams, creating and governing
  documentation that is accessible, structured, and AI-ready.
  You’ll be building this function from the ground up – our
  first dedicated technical writer – so you’ll shape both the
  standards and the workflows that support adoption across hx.
  
  You’ll work hands-on to design documentation systems,
  implement AI-assisted authoring, and enforce consistency
  across diverse content sources. With the freedom to
  experiment and the backing to scale your ideas, you’ll
  create lasting impact for both internal teams and global
  clients.
  
  What you’ll be doing
  
  - Designing and delivering structured, AI-powered
    documentation that makes hx products easy to understand,
    adopt, and scale.
  - Implementing documentation standards, workflows, and
    governance across teams to ensure consistency and
    discoverability.
  - Partnering with engineering, product, and customer teams to
    capture knowledge and translate it into accessible, high-
    impact content.
  - Building content pipelines and structures that support AI-
    powered search, question-answering, and automated
    validation.
  - Introducing and refining automation and feedback mechanisms
    to continuously improve documentation quality.
  - Driving adoption of documentation practices that reduce
    support needs and accelerate onboarding for users.
  
  What you’ll need to have done
  
  - Built technical documentation in a fast-paced software
    environment that improved adoption or reduced support
    queries.
  - Applied AI/automation (e.g. LLMs, workflow tools like
    Zapier/n8n, Grammarly, Claude, or similar) to streamline
    content workflows or improve quality.
  - Designed or restructured documentation systems to be
    scalable, maintainable, and discoverable.
  - Partnered with engineers, product managers, or customer
    teams to capture technical detail and translate it for
    diverse audiences.
  - Established or championed standards for tone, style, and
    structure, ensuring consistency across multiple
    contributors.
  - Owned end-to-end delivery of documentation projects, from
    requirements gathering through to validation and rollout.
  
  You’re unlikely to thrive here if
  
  - You prefer static documentation over evolving, AI-driven
    workflows, showing proactiveness and bringing meaningful
    change.
  - You shy away from experimenting with AI tools and workflows,
    and reluctant to learn new approaches.
  - You are uncomfortable taking ownership of standards,
    quality, and consistency in your work.
  
  If reading our Culture Document leaves you feeling neutral
  rather than energised, hx may not be the place where you’ll
  do your best work. We’re building something that asks for
  commitment and conviction, and we want you to feel excited
  by the opportunity to grow with us.
  
  Compensation
  
  At hx, we’re committed to salary transparency. You’ll always
  have clarity on pay early in the process - our Talent
  Partner will share details with you during initial
  conversations - and we’re working towards publishing salary
  information for all roles globally.
  
  Because we’re building at the intersection of
  technology/SaaS and insurance, our roles don’t always map
  neatly onto traditional benchmarks. Our approach is to
  design compensation that’s competitive in the market, fair
  across teams, and aligned with the impact our people make.
  
  Equity: We offer equity across all roles at hx, making it a
  significant component of total compensation. Your talent
  partner will be able to share more details about this.
