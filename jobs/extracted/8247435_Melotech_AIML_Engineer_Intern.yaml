  What you will do
  
  As our ML Engineer Intern, you'll be the technical backbone
  powering our content platform. You'll tackle the critical
  questions: How do we build ML systems that scale to millions
  of users while maintaining low latency? What's the optimal
  architecture for training and deploying models that
  understand cultural trends in real-time? And how do we
  leverage cutting-edge models to enhance creative processes
  while preserving quality? Working fully autonomously
  alongside our founder and the team, your answers to these
  questions will directly influence our company's success. On
  a typical day, your tasks may include:
  
  - Building and deploying production ML models for within our
    content and product ecosystem
  - Designing scalable ML infrastructure and pipelines that
    handle massive media datasets
  - Implementing inference systems for content optimization
    across multiple verticals
  - Fine-tuning and deploying multimodal AI systems using MLOps
    best practices
  - Collaborating with data science teams to transition research
    models into production-ready systems
  - Optimizing model performance for cost efficiency while
    maintaining accuracy and speed requirements
  - Integrating ML capabilities into existing platforms and
    building APIs for seamless model consumption
  
  Who you are
  
  You're a production-focused upcoming ML engineer who bridges
  the gap between cutting-edge tech and scalable systems. Your
  expertise lies in building robust ML infrastructure that
  powers real-world applications at scale. You thrive in fast-
  paced environments where your technical decisions directly
  impact business outcomes and user experiences. Typically,
  your profile will look like this:
  
  - Degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Mathematics,
    Engineering, or related technical field
  - 3+ years of hands-on ML engineering experience building
    production systems at Big Tech companies, high-growth
    startups, or media/entertainment platforms
  - Expert-level proficiency in Python, ML frameworks, and cloud
    platforms
  - Extensive experience with MLOps tools and practices
    including Docker, Kubernetes, model versioning, and
    monitoring systems
  - Proven track record deploying and scaling ML models in
    production environments with high availability
    requirements
  - Self-directed approach with ability to architect complex
    systems independently while collaborating across technical
    teams
  - You thrive in a fast-paced and performance-oriented
    environment
  - Colleagues would describe you as hard-working, ambitious and
    persistent
  - You're obsessed with music, video or social media
  
  What makes this exciting
  
  You are one of the first employees of an ambitious team,
  changing the world of media and entertainment. Being early
  means every decision you make shapes our trajectory. You're
  not a cog in the machine but the captain of your own ship,
  rewarded for performance and respected for leadership. Flat
  hierarchies mean that your voice matters, your ideas get
  implemented, and your impact is immediate. We pay
  competitive salaries and make you an owner of the business
  with equity. We work remotely to give you complete freedom
  over your life, while meeting regularly around the world for
  global offsites where we strategize, bond, and push
  boundaries together.
  
  What the process will look like
  
  We hire on a rolling basis. Earliest starting date is always
  ASAP. Once you begin our process, you can progress from
  start to offer within a week, depending on how quickly you
  can move through each stage:
  
  - Take-home case study: Real-world project - showcase your
    skills and working style
  - Case interview: 90-minute case discussion - getting to know
    you & present and debate your results with a team member
  - Online assessment: Motivational questionnaire and aptitude
    test - are you made for the job?
