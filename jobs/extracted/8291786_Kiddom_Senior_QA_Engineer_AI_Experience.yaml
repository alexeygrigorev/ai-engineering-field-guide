  - Testing & Debugging: Design and execute comprehensive tests,
    and debug complex issues, in possibly unfamiliar areas of
    the application.
  - AI Tooling: Proactively integrate AI tools into your QA
    workflows to improve efficiency and accuracy, while
    evaluating and recommending specific testing tools (e.g.,
    self-healing scripts, AI-driven test generation) to
    increase team velocity.
  - Testing AI Features: Validate AI-driven educational
    features, such as personalized learning paths or automated
    grading systems, ensuring accuracy and bias mitigation.
  - Automation & Code Quality: Create complex test scripts, and
    conduct high-quality code reviews for automated scripts
    with actionable feedback.
  - Documentation: Develop thorough test plans that prioritize
    maintainability and address immediate business needs.
    Utilize LLMs to generate test data, summarize bug reports,
    and create initial drafts of test documentation.
  - Defect Management: Conduct in-depth defect analysis to
    identify root causes and trends, improving overall product
    quality.
  - Support: support customers by triaging user-reported issues.
  
  What we're looking for...
  
  - 5+ years of professional experience in functional manual
    testing.
  - Expert Knowledge: Expert understanding of core QA concepts,
    testing strategies, and the software test cycle process.
  - Automation Proficiency: Deep experience with functional
    automation tools (Playwright, Selenium, and JUnit, etc.)
  - AI Tooling: Proven ability to use AI tools for test
    automation, bug triage, and test data generation to
    streamline repetitive tasks.
  - Communication & Influence: Excellent verbal and written
    communication skills with a track record of contributing
    materially outside of individual work to assist the wider
    team.
  - Debugging Skills: Strong ability to solve technical issues
    in both familiar and unfamiliar functionality.
  - Work Style: Excellent attention to detail, high
    accountability, and the ability to handle problems from
    start to finish with an appropriate response.
