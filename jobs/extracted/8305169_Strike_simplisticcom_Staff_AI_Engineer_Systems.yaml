  Strike is the Bitcoin company. With Strike, you can buy and
  sell bitcoin, pay bills, and borrow against your holdings.
  From individuals to businesses, Strike is purpose-built for
  every step of the Bitcoin journey. Available in more than
  100 countries — including the U.S., Europe, Latin America,
  and Africa — Strike is building a better financial system
  powered by Bitcoin. Bitcoin is better money. Strike is how
  you use it.
  
  Role:
  
  We are seeking a Staff AI Engineer (Systems) to join our
  Core Team.
  
  Strike is already a high-velocity, cloud-native engineering
  organization. We run an immutable infrastructure on GKE, we
  enforce "Shift-Left" security, and we deploy constantly. We
  are full on integrating frontier AI capabilities directly
  into our ecosystem - not as a gimmick, but as a force
  multiplier for our team.
  
  This is a Systems Engineering role. You will not be fine-
  tuning models or building chatbots for fun. You will be
  building the secure connective tissue that allows agentic
  systems to interact with our real-world infrastructure. You
  will define how agents authenticate, how they access tools,
  and - crucially - when they should be trusted.
  
  What You Will Do
  
  - Build the Connected Ecosystem: We have already
    operationalized tools like Copilot Agents, Gemini, Claude,
    Agentic CLIs, n8n workflows, and local agent runtimes.
    Your job is to build the unified, secure layer that
    connects these tools to our core platforms (e.g., building
    internal MCP servers).
    - Create IDE Agents: Help us fine-tune and deploy IDE agents
      that accelerate coding for the entire engineering
      organization.
    - Develop Agentic Workflows: Create orchestration layers and
      secure runtime environments for LLM tool-use.
    - Bridge Information Silos: Build out the enterprise knowledge
      base to connect disparate data sources for agentic
      reasoning.
  - Define Tiered Autonomy: You will design the security
    patterns for different levels of agent independence - from
    "Advisory" (read-only) to "Autonomous" (action-taking).
    You will implement the "Verifiable State" and "Revert"
    mechanisms that make Tier 3 autonomy safe.
  - Secure the Frontier: Design the auth patterns for agentic
    access. You will solve hard problems around
    authentication, authorization, and "human-in-the-loop"
    safeguards, ensuring we move fast without breaking our
    "Zero Trust" principles.
  - Pragmatic Building: You will be the voice of reason. You
    know when to use an LLM, and when to just write a script.
    You will help teams identify "Units of Toil" and target
    them with the right level of abstraction.
  - Force Multiply the Team: Embed with teams to unblock their
    workflows. You will serve as the expert on frontier tools,
    helping engineers and the broader team optimize their
    setups and adopt "AI Native" workflows.
  
  What We Are Looking For
  
  - Full Stack Systems DNA: You are a polyglot engineer. You
    understand the entire stack - from frontend interfaces to
    backend distributed systems and cloud infrastructure.
  - Frontier AI Proficiency: You are fluent in the current
    landscape of AI engineering. You have built
    implementations using patterns like MCP, RAG, function-
    calling, and evals. You understand techniques like AI as a
    Judge, Agent Self-Improvement, and how to balance
    deterministic systems with non-deterministic outputs.
  - Security-First Mindset: You understand the risks of
    deploying LLMs in a production environment. You are
    familiar with concepts like Shift-Left security, least-
    privilege access, and robust secrets management.
  - Organizational Influence: You have excellent communication,
    collaboration, and influencing skills. You can explain
    complex AI concepts to non-technical stakeholders and
    drive consensus on architectural decisions.
  
  Our Environment (Context)
  
  - Infrastructure: Fully Cloud-Native on GCP, Infrastructure as
    Code
  - Orchestration: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with Helm &
    ArgoCD.
  - Languages: C#/.NET (Core Services), Python (Data/Scripts),
    TypeScript (Web).
  - Security: Comprehensive enterprise secrets management and
    governance tooling.
  - AI Stack: We are actively leveraging many frontier tools and
    techniques.
  
  The Culture
  
  - High Agency: We don't do hand-holding. We expect you to
    solve problems.
  - High Velocity: We ship. If you prefer debating philosophy
    for weeks over shipping code, this is not the place for
    you.
  - One Singular Unit: We are a lean, fast-moving team. We move
    together - everyone has a role, everyone blocks and
    tackles for each other.
  
  US-Based Positions
  
  - Salary range: $216,000 - 232,000
  - Equity in a high-growth startup
  - Health, dental, and vision insurance premium contributions;
    short & long-term disability insurance and basic life
    insurance
  - Cell phone and internet reimbursement
  - Flexible PTO, sick leave & parental leave
  - Access to a company 401k plan
  
  Non US-Based positions
  
  - Location Dependent
  
  We do not make hiring decisions based on educational history
  whatsoever. Our Founder is a college dropout. We employ high
  school dropouts, PHD candidates and everything in-between.
  We do not hire credentials. We simply hire talented,
  passionate individuals who are excited to be a part of our
  team.
