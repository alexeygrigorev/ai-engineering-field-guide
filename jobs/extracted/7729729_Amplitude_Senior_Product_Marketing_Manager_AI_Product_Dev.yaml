  As an organization, we deliver for our customers by living our values. We operate from a place of humility, take ownership of problems and successes, approach challenges with a growth mindset, and put our customers at the center of everything we do.
  
  **Amplitude’s Commitment to Diversity Equity & Inclusion (DEI): **Amplitude believes that diversity enables the creation of better products, improves the ability to solve complex problems, and drives more powerful solutions. We strive to create an environment of inclusion—one focused on psychological safety, empathy, and human connection—that will allow employees of all backgrounds to thrive.
  
  Product development is fundamentally being transformed by AI. As coding gets dramatically faster, the critical bottlenecks shift: *What should we build?* *Which AI model drives the outcomes we care about?* *Did this feature actually drive the outcomes we care about?*  This shift is creating a new software development lifecycle in which analytics plays a mission critical role where Product Managers have the autonomy to test hypotheses, measure AI model performance, and iterate based on real outcomes.
  
  Amplitude is building the platform that enables this new reality— Our experimentation and analytics stack gives PMs the tools to work more effectively with engineering: faster feedback loops, clearer impact measurement, and the confidence to make bold product bets.
  
  About the role 
  
  **As a Sr. Product Marketing Manager, you will:** partner with our product, GTM, and customer teams to position Amplitude as the platform that democratizes data-driven product development—empowering PMs to act with speed and conviction in the AI era.
  
  We're looking for a **Sr.** **Product Marketing Manager** to position Amplitude as the platform that empowers product builders to ship, test, and optimize AI products with confidence. You'll own go-to-market strategy for our **Feature Experimentation, Feature Flags, SDKs and LLM Analytics**—the stack that enables Product teams to move faster, experiment fearlessly, and make decisions based on real user outcomes, not gut instinct.
  
  This is a high-impact role for someone who understands both product development workflows and has the technical fluency to bridge Product and Engineering teams. You'll help PMs gain the autonomy to test ideas, validate hypotheses, and drive product velocity without constant engineering dependencies.
  
  What you will own
  
  **Shape the narrative for product development**
  
  - Articulate why analytics becomes exponentially more critical as AI accelerates product development—when you can build 10x faster, knowing *what* to build and *whether it worked* becomes the competitive edge
  
  - Position Amplitude as the platform that gives Product teams the autonomy to test AI models, validate features, and drive outcomes without engineering bottlenecks
  
  - Tell the story of how experimentation culture transforms product velocity—from "let's discuss what might work" to "let's test and know what works"
  
  **Bridge Product and Engineering with authentic fluency**
  
  - Develop messaging that resonates with Product Managers while demonstrating enough technical depth to earn credibility with Engineering partners
  
  - Create content that helps PMs understand how to leverage experimentation, feature flags, and analytics throughout the product lifecycle—not just at launch
  
  - Speak comfortably about product development workflows: hypothesis testing, gradual rollouts, AI model evaluation, conversion optimization, and impact measurement
  
  **Drive adoption across product organizations**
  
  - Lead launches for experimentation, feature management, and LLM analytics capabilities with a focus on PM workflows and time-to-value
  
  - Build enablement programs that help sales and customer success teams speak to product organizations about experimentation culture, analytics maturity, and AI-readiness
  
  - Partner with product to shape roadmap based on how modern product teams want to work—faster feedback loops, clearer impact visibility, more autonomy
  
  **Build compelling product stories with customer evidence**
  
  - Work with customers building AI products to showcase how experimentation enables product velocity at scale
  
  - Create case studies that demonstrate real outcomes: increases in user satisfaction, lifts in conversion, ability to safely test models on small cohorts
  
  - Translate "we measure real things instead of fake things" into repeatable playbooks for product teams across different stages and verticals
  
  **Position Amplitude's unique value for product teams**
  
  - Differentiate Amplitude from developer-first tools by emphasizing how we empower *Product teams* with analytics autonomy, not just engineers
  
  - Identify gaps where product teams struggle to get fast, actionable insights from their experimentation and analytics tools
  
  - Articulate why analytics is becoming more load-bearing as AI makes building faster but deciding *what* to build harder
  
  **What we are looking for:**
  
  - **6+ years of product marketing experience** in B2B SaaS, ideally with exposure to product development tools, experimentation platforms, or analytics products
  
  - **Product development fluency:** You understand modern product workflows—how teams prioritize, ship, measure, and iterate. You can speak credibly about experimentation methodologies, hypothesis testing, and data-driven decision making
  
  - **Ability to bridge Product and Engineering:** You're technical enough to understand how things work under the hood and can translate between PM priorities and engineering constraints. You don't need to write code, but you understand the product development lifecycle
  
  - **Experience with experimentation or analytics tools:** Hands-on understanding of A/B testing, feature flags, or product analytics—ideally through direct use or through marketing these capabilities
  
  - **Exceptional storytelling:** Ability to craft narratives that resonate with Product leaders—connecting product velocity, experimentation culture, and business outcomes in compelling ways
  
  - **Cross-functional leadership:** Proven ability to partner effectively with product, sales, customer success, and marketing teams to drive launches and adoption
  
  **Preferred Qualifications:**
  
  - Hands-on experience with digital analytics and Amplitude a plus
  
  - Savvy with AI tools and a desire to readily leverage these tools to scale.
  
  - Familiarity with analytics tools such as Amplitude or similar platforms.
  
  - Solid technical chops and an ability to quickly dive in and learn new technologies.
  
  - Hands-on experience with customers and full-funnel marketing.
  
  **What makes you successful in this role:**
  
  - **Product empathy:** You understand what PMs care about (velocity, autonomy, impact visibility, confidence in decisions) and can authentically speak to those priorities
  
  - **Technical curiosity:** You ask good questions, learn quickly, and can explain technical concepts to non-technical audiences without oversimplifying
  
  - **Comfort with ambiguity:** AI-native product development is still emerging. You're energized by shaping narratives in new categories rather than executing established playbooks
  
  - **Bias toward action:** You ship, iterate, and leverage AI tools to move faster. You test hypotheses with real customers and refine based on feedback
  
  - **Experimentation mindset:** You practice what you preach—using data to inform decisions, running tests when you're uncertain, and measuring what matters
  
  **Why This Role Matters**
  
  The next decade of product development will be defined by teams who can:
  
  - Ship 10x faster with AI, making "what to build" and "did it work" the only sustainable competitive advantages
  
  - Test AI models continuously—not just at launch—to find the ones that actually drive user satisfaction and business outcomes
  
  - Make decisions based on real user behavior and business metrics, not proxies like clicks or vanity metrics
  
  - Give Product Managers the autonomy to experiment, measure, and iterate without constant engineering dependencies
  
  Product teams building AI products face unprecedented complexity: unpredictable model outputs, variable costs, rapidly evolving capabilities, and the pressure to ship faster than ever. The winners will be the teams who can experiment fearlessly, learn quickly, and make data-driven decisions at velocity.
  
  This role sits at the center of that transformation. You'll help define how the industry thinks about product analytics in the age of AI, position Amplitude as the platform that enables faster, more autonomous product teams, and work with cutting-edge customers who are redefining what's possible.
  
  If you want to shape how product teams build and optimize AI products—and have the product development fluency to speak credibly to this audience—this is the role for you.
