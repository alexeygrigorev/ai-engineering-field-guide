  ****Who We Are****
  
  Our mission is to make the world programmable. Sight is one of the key ways we understand the world, and soon this will be true for the software we use, too.
  
  We’re building the tools, community, and resources needed to make the world programmable with artificial intelligence. Roboflow simplifies building and using computer vision models. Today, over 1M+ developers, including those from half the Fortune 100, use Roboflow’s machine learning open source and hosted tools. That includes counting cells to accelerate cancer research, improving construction site safety, digitizing floor plans, preserving coral reef populations, guiding drone flight, and much more.
  
  Roboflow is supported by great customers and investors, having raised over 63 million from Y Combinator, Google Ventures, Craft Ventures, Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, amongst other leading software investors.
  
  Roboflowers are passionate builders who value ownership, accountability, and a bias toward action. We're curious, hands-on with new tech, and prefer showing our work over talking about it. Many of us have a founder mindset and thrive in our high-autonomy environment.
  
  ****What You’ll Do****
  
  This role focuses on building agentic, AI-powered experiences that help people build computer vision solutions with Roboflow end-to-end, across both in-app experiences and external integrations. You’ll also contribute to the core product surfaces agents rely on, especially Workflows, our computer vision workflow and pipeline builder, and our Deployments offering in general. This includes tightening the path from prototype to production by filling in missing functionality and improving reliability, tooling, and discoverability.
  
  You’ll have a lot of freedom to advocate for what should be built next, and you’ll contribute to product and strategy decisions. If you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably won’t be a good fit.
  
  Most of our product is written in JavaScript/TypeScript, and our computer vision and inference pipeline is in Python. We run primarily on Firebase and GCS, with some ML infrastructure on AWS, and we’re increasingly using Docker for both internal systems and customer-facing products. You don’t need deep experience in all of these areas, but you should be excited to learn new skill sets as needed and bring ideas that help level up how we build and ship.
  ****Example projects****
  - 
  
  Building agentic product experiences that guide users through building, debugging, and shipping CV projects.
  
  - 
  
  Building integration surfaces that let external agents interact with Roboflow (tool interfaces, APIs, SDK capabilities).
  
  - 
  
  Extending Workflows with new blocks and improving the building UX.
  
  - 
  
  Strengthening SDKs and end-to-end user journeys so developers can go from idea to shipped system with fewer steps.
  
  - 
  
  Write documentation and examples that make the agent and deployment features easy to adopt.
  
  ****Who You Are****
  - 
  
  4+ years building production software with strong product instincts and end-to-end ownership.
  
  - 
  
  Shipped an agentic system in a previous role or built one as a founder, with hands-on experience in tool calling and orchestration.
  
  - 
  
  Comfortable contributing in TypeScript/JavaScript and Python.
  
  - 
  
  Enjoy talking to users and turning feedback into shipped improvements.
  
  - 
  
  Know how to utilize AI coding tools well to move fast while keeping quality high.
  
  - 
  
  Execution-oriented and comfortable with autonomy, ambiguity, and fast-changing priorities.
  
  - 
  
  Bonus: familiarity with computer vision.
  
  ****What You’ll Receive****
  
  To determine your salary, we use a number of market and data-driven salary sources. We review all salaries every six months to ensure we stay in line with the market.
  
  💰 The target compensation for this role is $163,000 - $180,000 base (depending on level / location).
  
  📈 In addition to our cash compensation, we offer generous perks and benefits. Below are some of the highlights:
  
  - 
  
  $4000/yr Travel Stipend to travel anywhere anytime to work alongside other Roboflowers
  
  - 
  
  $350/mo Productivity stipend to spend on things that make your work environment more productive, like high-speed internet at home or a co-working space
  
  - 
  
  Cover up to 100% of your health insurance costs for you and your partner or family
  
  - 
  
  Equity in the company so we are all invested in the future of computer vision
