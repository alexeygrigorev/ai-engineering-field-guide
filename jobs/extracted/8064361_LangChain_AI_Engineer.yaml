  About the Role
  
  We're looking for an AI Engineer to join our Professional
  Services team. You'll work directly with enterprise
  customers to design, build, and optimize production-grade AI
  agent systems. This role combines software development,
  AI/ML expertise, and customer-facing skills, you'll work on
  everything from multi-agent system design to evaluation
  framework implementation, requiring deep technical expertise
  in agent engineering with understanding of cloud
  infrastructure and deployment patterns.
  
  You'll join a collaborative team environment with a strong
  engineering culture, with direct impact on customer success
  and the opportunity to shape best practices while working
  with cutting-edge AI technology.

    with Subagents/Handoffs/Router patterns, implement agent
    logic using langchain/langgraph, design comprehensive
    evaluation frameworks, optimize prompts with A/B testing,
    implement state management (short-term and long-term
    memory), and design RAG patterns with vector store
    integration
  - Deployment & Operations: Guide customers on agent deployment
    and configuration management, integrate agents into CI/CD
    pipelines, collaborate with Solution Architects on
    infrastructure requirements, and set up observability
    using LangSmith
