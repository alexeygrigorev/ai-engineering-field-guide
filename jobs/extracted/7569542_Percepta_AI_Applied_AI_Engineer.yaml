  ****Who we are****
  
  Percepta’s mission is to **transform critical institutions with applied AI.** We care that industries that power the world (e.g. healthcare, manufacturing, energy) benefit from frontier technology. 
  
  To make that happen, we embed with industry-leading customers to drive AI transformation. We bring together:
  
  - 
  
  Forward-deployed expertise in engineering, product, and research
  
  - 
  
  Mosaic, our in-house toolkit for rapidly deploying agentic workflows
  
  - 
  
  Strategic partnerships with Anthropic, McKinsey, AWS, companies within the General Catalyst portfolio, and more
  
  Our team is a quickly growing group of Applied AI Engineers, Embedded Product Managers and Researchers motivated by diffusing the promise of AI into improvements we can feel in our day to day lives. 
  
  Percepta is a direct partnership with General Catalyst, a global transformation and investment company.
  
  ****About the role****
  
  We’re hiring **Applied AI Engineers** who will work directly with customer executives, operators, and technical teams to define and deliver high-impact AI systems. We don't build prototypes or laboratory projects- you’ll design, build, and ship production-grade AI agents and workflows that drive millions in business value for customers.
  
  Our Applied AI Engineers:
  
  - 
  
  **Shape the AI vision**: Collaborate with customer stakeholders to define their long-term AI strategy and transformation roadmap.
  
  - 
  
  **Identify high-leverage use cases**: Work backwards from the long-term vision to surface and prioritize specific AI applications that connect our ambition to measurable business value.
  
  - 
  
  **Ship real products**: Rapidly build and deploy AI solutions that work in the wild, with real users and real data. 
  
  - 
  
  **Advance our core product**: Encode the lessons from our customer engagements in our Mosaic product, consistently contributing new features, patterns, and abstractions.
  
  ****What we’re looking for****
  
  - 
  
  **AI-nativeness:** You're excited about the potential for AI to transform businesses and want to play a hands-on role in bringing frontier technology into critical institutions.
  
  - 
  
  **Being generative and collaborative:** You love constantly jamming on new “what if” ideas with teammates and partners.
  
  - 
  
  **Extreme ownership**: You’re willing to jump in and love being the one on the hook. You aren’t going to wait to be pointed at a task—you’re going to identify what you think we should do next, and then do it.
  
  - 
  
  **Execution excellence and speed**: You can build stuff in messy environments and know how to get code written and shipped quickly. You can hold the balance of speed and quality and know when to push the pace vs. when to slow down.
  
  - 
  
  **Customer-obsession and respect**: You’re motivated by understanding customer pain points and iterating directly with end users to deliver wins quickly.
  
  ****Bonus if you have****
  
  - 
  
  Hands-on experience with **LLM tooling** (LangGraph, Mastra, Agents SDK, etc).
  
  - 
  
  Built and deployed **production LLM-powered systems** (tool use, RAG pipelines, multi-step agents, human-in-the-loop, etc).
  
  - 
  
  Strong technical foundations in Python/TypeScript, cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure) and DevOps tooling.
  
  - 
  
  Prior startup or **founding engineer** experience, balancing craft, ownership, and speed.
  
  We’re working against an incredibly ambitious mission. It won’t be easy, but it will likely be the most fulfilling work of your career. If this excites you, let's chat, even if you don't meet all of the qualifications above.
