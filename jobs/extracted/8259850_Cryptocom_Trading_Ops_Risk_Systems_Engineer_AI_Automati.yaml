description: |
  We are seeking a highly analytical and technical
  professional to spearhead the evolution of our trading
  infrastructure.  This hybrid role combines the fast-paced
  execution of a Trading Operations Specialist, the analytical
  rigor of a Risk Manager, and the technical capabilities of
  an AI-focused Developer.
  
  The successful candidate will not only manage daily
  operational workflows and risk monitoring but will also lead
  the digital transformation of these functions. You will
  leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), machine learning, and
  advanced scripting to automate legacy manual processes,
  improve predictive risk modeling, and build real-time P&L
  visualization tools.
  
  Key Responsibilities:
  
  - 1. Trading Operations and P&L Analysis with AI
  - Manage the end-to-end lifecycle of trades across multi-asset
    classes.  Develop agentic AI workflows using Python (ML)
    and MLOps tools to automate manual operations and
    reconciliations
  - Perform daily P&L attribution and explain variance by
    decomposing market moves, Greeks, and new activity.
    Leverage AI/ML frameworks (e.g., OpenAI API, LangChain, or
    local LLMs) to build intelligent agents for anomaly
    detection in trade data and automated commentary
    generation for P&L reports.
  - Ensure data integrity across trading systems, middle-office
    platforms, and downstream finance ledgers.
  - 2. Risk Monitoring & Control
  - Intelligent Risk Management: Develop real-time, AI-driven
    risk models that use machine learning to predict market
    volatility and alert the desk to emerging cross-market
    risks.
  - Develop and maintain sophisticated risk reporting dashboards
    for the desk.
  
  Requirements & Qualifications
  
  - Experience: 5+ years in front-office operations, quant
    development, or a blend of risk management and systems
    architecture within a financial institution.
  - Technical Stack: Expert proficiency in Python (for AI/ML),
    and strong SQL skills. Experience building agentic AI
    workflows is a significant advantage.
  - Financial Acumen: Deep understanding of P&L attribution,
    financial controls, market risk indicators (Greeks, VaR),
    financial markets and products.
  - Problem Solving: A "systems-thinking" approach to
    operations—treating every manual task as a bug that needs
    an automated solution.
  - Capacity: Ability to thrive in a high-intensity environment
    requiring extended hours when necessary to meet global
    trading demands.
  - Agility: Willingness to participate in a rotational weekend
    and on-call schedule, providing immediate resolution to
    live production issues
industries:
  - Fintech
  - Financial Services
  - Cryptocurrency
  - NFT
  - Web3
