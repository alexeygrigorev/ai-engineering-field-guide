  ****About the Team****
  
  The AI Flows team builds AI-powered workflows inside Miro that help teams go from idea to outcome faster: turning intent into structured steps, suggestions, and actions directly on the canvas. We’re in a post–zero-to-one phase, iterating quickly with real users, tightening UX loops, and shaping what “AI workflows” should feel like in Miro, reliable, delightful, and genuinely useful.
  ****About the Role****
  
  We’re looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer who is exceptional at building complex, highly interactive UIs and who cares deeply about craft, clarity, and how things feel to users.
  
  This is not a “forms and dashboards” role. You’ll be working in a rich, graphical environment with real performance constraints, real users, and real scale.
  
  If you enjoy hard frontend problems, visual complexity, and shaping how AI shows up in a mainstream product , this is a very good seat.
  ****What you’ll do****
  - Design and build **highly interactive, visual UI** on top of Miro’s real-time canvas.
  
  - Shape the core Flows experience: how users create, understand, run, and trust AI workflows.
  
  - Turn fuzzy product ideas and design intent into **clean, intuitive, polished interfaces**.
  
  - Work closely with product and design to explore new interaction patterns for AI in a collaborative environment.
  
  - Take ownership end-to-end: from problem framing → implementation → iteration → refinement.
  
  - Improve performance, architecture, and UX quality wherever you see friction.
  ****Why this is interesting****
  - You’ll be working on **AI in a real product, at real scale** - not demos, not toys.
  
  - Your work will directly shape how millions of people experience AI at work.
  
  - You’ll be in a **lean, low-bureaucracy team** with real ownership and influence.
  
  - You’ll combine hard technical challenges (performance, real-time UI, visual complexity) with meaningful product impact.
  
  - The culture we’re aiming for is **humble **and** straightforward**: strong people, peer-level collaboration, and minimal corporate theater.
  ****What you’ll need****
  - 6+ years of experience building frontend applications with modern languages, frameworks, and technologies.
  
  - Strong **JavaScript** / **TypeScript** fundamentals.
  
  - Proven ability to build **complex, interactive web interfaces** (not just CRUD).
  
  - Good architectural instincts: you can structure frontend code so it scales and stays sane.
  
  - You think in systems, not just components.
  
  - You have a good visual and UX instinct, you can tell when something feels off.
  
  - Experience in graphics-heavy products, editors, games, or other highly visual domains is a strong plus.
  
  - Collaborative, team-first mindset with a strong sense of ownership and integrity.
  
  - Clear and thoughtful communicator, comfortable asking questions and being transparent about uncertainty.
  
  - Respectful and constructive in how you work with others, giving credit where it’s due and contributing to a positive team culture.
  
  - Curious and open-minded, with a genuine interest in learning from teammates and exploring new approaches.
  
  - Quick to ramp up on new domains and able to reason effectively in unfamiliar problem spaces.
  
  - Proactive and self-motivated, you identify opportunities for improvement and take initiative to make things better.
  ****What's in it for you****
  
  ****
  
  - Competitive equity package
  
  - Corporate pension plan
  
  - Lunch, snacks and drinks provided in the office
  
  - Wellbeing benefit and WFH equipment allowance
  
  - Annual learning and development allowance to grow your skills and career
  
  - Travel allowance for your commute
  
  - Opportunity to work for a globally diverse team
