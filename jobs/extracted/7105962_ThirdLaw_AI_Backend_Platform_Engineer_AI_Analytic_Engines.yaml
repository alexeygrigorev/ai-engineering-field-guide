  About the Company
  
  ThirdLaw is building the control layer for AI in the
  enterprise. As companies rush to adopt LLMs and AI agents,
  they face new safety, compliance, and operational risks that
  traditional observability tools were never designed to
  detect. Metrics like latency or cost don’t capture when a
  model makes a bad decision, leaks sensitive data, or behaves
  unpredictably.
  
  We help IT and Security teams answer the foundational
  question: "Is this OK?"—and take real-time action when it’s
  not.
  
  Backed by top-tier venture firms and trusted by forward-
  looking enterprise design partners, we’re building the
  infrastructure to monitor, evaluate, and control AI behavior
  in real-world environments—at runtime, where it matters. If
  you're excited to build systems that help AI work as
  intended—and stop it when it doesn’t—we’d love to meet you.
  
  About the Role
  
  You won’t just be piping logs or tuning models—you’ll build
  and scale systems that reconcile latency, correctness, and
  observability across distributed pipelines. You’ll be
  designing the nervous system of a new class of
  software—where AI Agents reason, act, and fail in
  unpredictable ways. If you're excited by AI and want to
  shape its safe deployment—not just watch from the
  sidelines—this is your opportunity.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Architect scalable, low-latency services for running
    evaluations in real-time and batch, integrating with
    streaming data pipelines and trace-based event models.
  - Design and build the core evaluation engine within ThirdLaw
    that applies heuristics, semantic models, and foundation
    model calls to detect violations across LLM inputs and
    outputs.
  - Build a runtime intervention layer to determine and execute
    appropriate enforcement actions—such as block, redact,
    notify, escalate—based on evaluation results and risk
    context.
  - Create reusable frameworks for pluggable evaluators and
    intervention policies, supporting no-code authoring and
    automated deployment pipelines.
  - Configure and operationalize a vector database pipeline for
    RAG-like use cases.
  - Build for scale. Mitigate blocking gRPC threads, implement
    micro-batching & streaming for LLM/embedding calls and add
    reliability controls such as queue-based back-pressure and
    graceful degradation paths.
  
  Who We Are Looking ForRequired
  
  - 5+ years of Backend software engineering experience,
    including designing and shipping production software
    services
  - Strong coding proficiency in Python and/or Go
  - Deep experience with streaming data pipelines (e.g. Kafka,
    Pulsar, Redis Streams) and batch processing systems
  - Proven track record scaling high-QPS, low-latency services
    (p95/p99 ownership a plus).
  - Familiarity with vector databases (e.g. FAISS, Weaviate,
    Qdrant, pgvector) and embedding-based matching
  - Strong grasp of cloud-native infrastructure: containers,
    Kubernetes, serverless functions, CI/CD pipelines
  - Exposure to structured observability patterns, including
    OpenTelemetry (or similar tracing standards)
  - Comfortable designing—then defending—trade-offs around build
    vs buy vs OSS.
  
  Nice-to-Have
  
  - Experience with modern Python APIs & concurrency, e.g. gRPC,
    FastAPI, asyncio, multithreading/processes
  - Familiarity with ClickHouse, Apache Arrow, or fast
    analytical storage engines
  - Prior work on agent frameworks (e.g. LangChain, CrewAI,
    AutoGen) or LLM orchestration
  - Experience in trust & safety, compliance, or AI safety
    domains
  - Hands-on experience with secure enterprise integrations
    (authorization/authentication, webhooks, SIEM, IAM)
  
  Why Apply?
  
  Our team is small and focused, valuing autonomy and real
  impact over titles and management. We need strong technical
  skills, a proactive mindset, and clear written
  communication, as much of our work is asynchronous. If
  you're organized, take initiative, and want to work closely
  with customers to shape our products, you'll fit in well
  here.
  
  Finally, we pay market cash compensation and generally
  above-market equity. The compensation package for this role
  is benchmarked using Carta Total Compensation and reflects
  real-time market data for our company’s size, this role’s
  level, and your geographic location. We have well-designed
  and generous benefits.
