  Working as a coder at Hudson River Trading (HRT) means
  working on a small, highly productive, and efficient team.
  You may see "trading" in our name and assume you'll be
  relegated to some dark corner to code for the "business,"
  but that could not be further from the truth!
  
  At HRT, an automated trading firm based in NYC, the code you
  write *is* our business, so it is everyone's job to make
  sure our developers have everything they need to do their
  jobs well.
  
  As a member of the AI Tools team, you will be responsible
  for increasing productivity across the company by
  integrating the newest AI tools into our users’ workflows.
  Whether it’s for a Python developer writing a web app, a C++
  developer speeding up order execution, a researcher
  investigating trade signals, or even Business Development
  meeting with vendors - we are focused on deploying what
  works.
  
  This is an exciting opportunity to help build and define the
  AI tooling ecosystem at HRT. You will have to navigate the
  rapidly evolving options in this space, and adapt them to
  our own internal systems. You might be fixing auth one day,
  comparing vendors the next, and coding a new MCP the third.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Help us develop software that improves productivity for
    every office and department at HRT while using the latest
    technologies and techniques in software engineering and
    the broader AI tooling ecosystem
  - HRT has many high-impact areas where we are integrating AI
    tools; here’s what you could work on:
  
  Profile
  
  - You’re one of the top devs in your current organization, as
    measured by productivity, technical capability, and
    helpfulness to other devs
  - Experience deploying and maintaining applications. You’ve
    managed an application from the design phase through the
    production phase
  - You’re comfortable with defining direction in an environment
    of ambiguity and uncertainty. The AI tooling space changes
    rapidly
  - You really like to work with people who challenge you and
    make you better at what you do
  - In your spare time you code, tinker, read, explore, break
    things, and have an insatiable curiosity for all things AI
    and computer-related
  
  Qualifications
  
  - Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering,
    or a related field
  - Python experience is required, daily use of most recent
    standards preferred
  - C++ and JavaScript (TypeScript, React) experience a plus
  - Experience with the AI tooling ecosystem (use coding
    assistants/agentic workflows, ideally have built your own
    customizations)
  - Superior design, debugging, and problem solving skills
  - Knowledge of UNIX operating systems (we use Linux),
    system/processor performance, and network communication
  
  The estimated base salary range for this position is 200,000
  to 300,000 USD per year (or local equivalent). The base pay
  offered may vary depending on multiple individualized
  factors, including location, job-related knowledge, skills,
  and experience. This role will also be eligible for
  discretionary performance-based bonuses and a competitive
  benefits package.
  
  Culture
  
  Hudson River Trading (HRT) brings a scientific approach to
  trading financial products. We have built one of the world's
  most sophisticated computing environments for research and
  development. Our researchers are at the forefront of
  innovation in the world of algorithmic trading.  At HRT we
  welcome a variety of expertise: mathematics and computer
  science, physics and engineering, media and tech. We’re a
  community of self-starters who are motivated by the
  excitement of being at the cutting edge of automation in
  every part of our organization—from trading, to business
  operations, to recruiting and beyond. We value openness and
  transparency, and celebrate great ideas from HRT veterans
  and new hires alike. At HRT we’re friends and colleagues –
  whether we are sharing a meal, playing the latest board
  game, or writing elegant code. We embrace a culture of
  togetherness that extends far beyond the walls of our
  office. Feel like you belong at HRT? Our goal is to find the
  best people and bring them together to do great work in a
  place where everyone is valued. HRT is proud of our diverse
  staff; we have offices all over the globe and benefit from
  our varied and unique perspectives. HRT is an equal
  opportunity employer; so whoever you are we’d love to get to
  know you.
  
  Please be advised: Use of AI tools during interviews or
  assessments is strictly prohibited, unless otherwise
  instructed or agreed upon. We employ various methods to
  evaluate the authenticity of candidate responses. If we
  determine that AI assistance was used during any stage of
  the hiring process, we reserve the right to immediately
  disqualify your candidacy or rescind any job offers
  extended.
