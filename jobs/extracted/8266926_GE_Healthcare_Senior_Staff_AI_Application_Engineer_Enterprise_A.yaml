  Responsibilities
  
  - Design and develop AI-powered applications, integrating
    machine learning and generative models into enterprise-
    grade software products and internal tools. Own the full
    software development lifecycle (SDLC), including unit,
    integration, and end-to-end testing.
  - Frontend: Develop modern, intuitive interfaces for AI
    applications (React/Next.js, TypeScript, or equivalent)
    with a strong focus on usability, accessibility, and AI
    explainability.
  - Backend: Implement scalable and secure back-end services
    (FastAPI, Flask, or Node.js) to expose AI capabilities
    (LLMs, RAG pipelines, AI agents) through standardized
    APIs.
  - Translate data science prototypes and GenAI models (LLMs,
    diffusion models, transformers) into scalable applications
    or services with intuitive user interfaces and reliable
    back-end infrastructure.
  - Collaborate with insight leaders and business stakeholders
    on requirements gathering, project documentation, and
    development planning.
  - Partners with MLOps and GenAIOps teams to deploy, monitor,
    and continuously improve AI applications within
    standardized CI/CD pipelines.
  - Design and implement integrations using REST, GraphQL, and
    gRPC; work with cloud-based AI APIs (Azure, AWS, GCP) and
    enterprise data sources.
  - Integrate cloud-native AI services (AWS Bedrock, Azure
    OpenAI) and open-source frameworks (LangChain, LangGraph)
    into enterprise environments.
  - Monitor application performance and user adoption, iterating
    on models and workflows to enhance usability and business
    impact.
  - Optimize application performance, infrastructure efficiency,
    and LLM utilization.

    environments.
  - Expertise in Python, and full-stack engineering for AI —
    capable of leading architecture across front end, back
    end, and model integration.
  - Mastery of LLMs, diffusion models, RAG architectures, and
    multi-agent (A2A) systems, with demonstrated
    implementation in production.
  - Hands-on experience designing multi-model orchestration and
    context management using MCP or equivalent protocols /
    frameworks.
  - Deep understanding of LLMOps/GenAIOps platforms and
    pipelines, enabling robust observability, versioning, and
    continuous learning cycles.

    including cost optimization, scaling, and secure data
    governance.
  - Expertise in software architecture patterns (microservices,
    event-driven, serverless) and API ecosystems (REST, gRPC).
  - Proven leadership in AI security, governance, and
    compliance, ensuring full auditability and traceability.
  - Drives innovation through research translation, proof-of-
    concept leadership, and collaboration with Data Science,
    Ops, Product, and Platform teams.
