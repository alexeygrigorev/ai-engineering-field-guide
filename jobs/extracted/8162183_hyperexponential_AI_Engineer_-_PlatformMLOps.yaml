  About hyperexponential (hx)
  
  At hyperexponential, we’re building the AI-powered platform
  that enables the world’s most critical decisions in a $7
  trillion industry, which risks to take, and how to price
  them. These are the decisions that shape real-world
  outcomes: whether rockets successfully launch into space,
  autonomous vehicles make it to market, or communities
  recover after major storms.
  
  Until now, insurance has been making billion-dollar
  decisions using outdated tools. We’re changing that. Our
  platform brings together data, AI, and human expertise to
  give insurers the fastest path from submission to decision -
  helping them move faster, act smarter, and take on more risk
  with confidence.
  
  Backed by a16z, Highland Europe, and Battery Ventures, we’re
  scaling globally - already trusted by nearly 50 of the
  world’s largest insurers, with zero churn and billions in
  premiums flowing through hx.
  
  What began as a single product in one market has rapidly
  evolved into a multi-product, multi-territory platform
  powering every stage of pricing and underwriting. AI is at
  the core of what we do - from building the world’s first
  domain-specific AI peer programmer for insurance (think
  GitHub Copilot with a PhD in actuarial science) to shaping
  agentic workflows that reinvent how this industry operates.
  
  What makes hx different is the people who build it. Here,
  impact isn’t tied to title or tenure; it’s defined by the
  challenges you take on and the discipline you bring.
  Surrounded by peers who stretch you, you’ll do the best,
  hardest work of your life in a company engineered to endure.
  
  If that sounds like you, join us in building what comes
  next.
  
  About the hxAI team
  
  At hx, AI is central to how we build software and make
  decisions across the company. From large-scale document
  intelligence to a domain-specific AI peer-programmer used by
  actuaries and underwriters, hx is redefining how the
  insurance industry uses generative AI in production.
  
  The AI Platform team provides the platform that makes all of
  this possible. We design, build, and operate the shared
  systems that allow teams to train, deploy, evaluate, and
  monitor AI safely at scale — including model serving, data
  pipelines, observability, deployment automation, and compute
  orchestration.
  
  Working closely with product and research teams, we turn
  fast-moving experimentation into reliable, cost-efficient,
  and developer-friendly production systems. Our success is
  measured in faster releases, stronger model performance in
  the real world, and AI products that customers can trust
  with critical decisions.
  
  What you’ll be doing
  
  - Designing and operating scalable AI infrastructure for LLM
    inference, prompt management, and evaluation pipelines,
    supporting billions in premium flow.
  - Building self-service tools, SDKs, and APIs that empower
    product teams to move from prototype to production 30%
    faster.
  - Instrumenting production AI/ML workloads with standardised
    logging, tracing, and evaluation metrics, increasing
    observability coverage to 100% of deployed models.
  - Implementing intelligent routing, caching, and provider
    optimisation via the LLM gateway, reducing AI compute
    costs by up to 25%.
  - Driving adoption of shared platform services (LLM gateway,
    evaluation frameworks, monitoring) to replace bespoke
    solutions, increasing platform adoption across new AI
    features.
  - Championing developer experience by delivering comprehensive
    documentation and responsive support, resulting in higher
    internal customer satisfaction.
  
  What you’ll need to have done
  
  - Built and deployed production AI infrastructure that scaled
    to support enterprise-grade reliability and observability.
  - Delivered self-service tools or APIs that enabled multiple
    product teams to accelerate their AI/ML development
    cycles.
  - Implemented evaluation frameworks, A/B testing
    infrastructure, or monitoring solutions that measured and
    improved model performance, latency, cost, and quality in
    production.
  - Led initiatives to reduce AI compute costs through
    optimisation strategies such as intelligent routing or
    caching.
  - Successfully migrated teams from bespoke AI solutions to
    shared platform services, driving measurable adoption.
  - Prioritised and improved developer experience through
    documentation, support, or workflow enhancements.
  
  You’re unlikely to thrive here if
  
  - You prefer working in silos rather than collaborating
    closely with product and engineering teams.
  - You are uncomfortable with rapid change or ambiguity in
    technical requirements.
  - You are not motivated to take ownership and drive measurable
    impact beyond your immediate tasks.
  
  If reading our Culture Document leaves you feeling neutral
  rather than energised, hx may not be the place where you'll
  do your best work. We're building something that asks for
  commitment and conviction, and we want you to feel excited
  by the opportunity to grow with us.
  
  Compensation
  
  At hx, we're committed to salary transparency. You'll always
  have clarity on pay early in the process - our Talent
  Partner will share details with you during initial
  conversations - and we're working towards publishing salary
  information for all roles globally.
  
  Because we're building at the intersection of
  technology/SaaS and insurance, our roles don't always map
  neatly onto traditional benchmarks. Our approach is to
  design compensation that's competitive in the market, fair
  across teams, and aligned with the impact our people make.
  
  Equity: We offer equity across all roles at hx, making it a
  significant component of total compensation. Your Talent
  Partner will be able to share more details about this.
