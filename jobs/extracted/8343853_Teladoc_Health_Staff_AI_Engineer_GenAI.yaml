  - 
  
  Architect scalable data and AI workflows on Snowflake, Databricks, and Azure ML, integrating AI models with modern data lakehouse platforms.
  
  - 
  
  Build and maintain API-based AI services (FastAPI, Flask), enabling secure, performant, and reliable model access at scale.
  
  - 
  
  Define and implement CI/CD pipelines for GenAI and ML services, using GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps, MLFlow, and container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker).
  
  - 
  
  Develop and enforce MLOps/LLMOps best practices, including experiment tracking, model versioning, observability, and governance.
  
  - 
  
  Mentor ML engineers and data scientists on engineering rigor, scalable design, and production-readiness.
  
  - 
  
  Partner with cross-functional teams to integrate AI services into products, ensuring security, compliance, and resilience in regulated healthcare environments.

  Troubleshoot production AI systems, analyzing inference latency, drift, and performance issues, and implementing preventive solutions.
  
  - 
  
  Document and communicate architecture patterns, operational standards, and AI development frameworks across the organization.
  
  The time spent on each responsibility reflects an estimate and is subject to change dependent on business needs.
