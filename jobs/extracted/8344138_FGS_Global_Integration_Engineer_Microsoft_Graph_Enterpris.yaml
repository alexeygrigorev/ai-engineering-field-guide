  **What You'll Do**
  
  You'll build enterprise integrations that connect our AI platform to Microsoft 365 and other corporate systems. This is hands-on infrastructure work: implementing authentication flows, managing permissions, and creating data pipelines that enable AI agents to operate securely within enterprise environments. You'll work closely with senior engineers to expand our platform's integration capabilities—turning technical specifications into production code that consultants rely on daily.
  
  **Your Responsibilities**
  
  **Integration Development:**
  
  - Implement OAuth-based authentication flows with proper scope management
  
  - Build data pipelines for email, calendar, file storage, and collaboration platforms
  
  - Handle complex API scenarios like recurring events, large file uploads, and rate limiting
  
  - Create resource mapping between internal systems and external platforms
  
  **Microsoft Graph & Enterprise APIs:**
  
  - Develop integrations using Microsoft Graph API across multiple services
  
  - Implement search and query capabilities using platform-specific APIs
  
  - Optimize performance for high-volume operations
  
  - Build resilient error handling and retry logic
  
  **Security & Compliance:**
  
  - Work with IT teams on app registration and permission workflows
  
  - Implement secure token management with refresh and caching strategies
  
  - Follow enterprise security patterns and data access policies
  
  - Document integration approaches and technical decisions
  
  **Production Support:**
  
  - Monitor integration health and respond to issues
  
  - Handle API throttling and service disruptions gracefully
  
  - Debug authentication failures and permission problems
  
  - Contribute to team knowledge base and documentation
  
  **Your Profile**
  
  **Required:**
  
  - 3+ years backend engineering with API integration experience
  
  - Strong proficiency in Node.js and TypeScript
  
  - Deep understanding of Microsoft 365 architecture (Azure AD, SharePoint, Teams, Exchange Online)
  
  - Solid grasp of Microsoft's permission model (delegated vs. application permissions, consent frameworks, API scopes)
  
  - Experience with OAuth 2.0 flows and enterprise authentication patterns
  
  - Hands-on experience with Microsoft Graph API
  
  - Cloud platform experience with Azure and GCP
  
  - Ability to build resilient systems with proper error handling
  
  **Strongly Preferred:**
  
  - MSAL Node library implementation experience
  
  - Understanding of SharePoint site architecture, document libraries, and Teams structure
  
  - Experience with Microsoft Fabric or other Microsoft data architectures
  
  - Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation experience
  
  - Experience with caching systems (Redis or similar)
  
  - Background working with IT/security teams on enterprise integrations
  
  - Familiarity with AI/LLM platforms or agent systems
  
  **Bonus:**
  
  - Azure AD app registration and administration experience
  
  - Knowledge of other enterprise APIs (Google Workspace, Salesforce, Slack)
  
  - Understanding of Graph SDK internals
  
  - Experience with Adaptive Cards or Teams extensibility
  
  - Familiarity with Microsoft's tenant architecture and multi-tenant applications
  
  **Why This Matters**
  
  Our AI platform serves consultants across a global organization. The integrations you build enable the AI to access the right context while respecting security boundaries—directly impacting how effectively consultants can work.
  
  We're not building prototypes—we're scaling proven capabilities. Our data infrastructure processes millions of media articles, social posts, and stakeholder signals daily. Our agents don't just answer questions—they generate press releases, analyze media coverage, and provide strategic recommendations that consultants use in high-stakes client situations.
  
  **What makes this interesting:**
  
  - You'll work on real technical challenges: enterprise permissions, asynchronous operations, token lifecycle management
  
  - Your code enables AI capabilities that consultants use every day
  
  - You'll learn integration patterns for AI agents in enterprise environments
  
  - Close collaboration with AI researchers, product teams, and senior engineers
  
  **What you'll learn:**
  
  - Enterprise authentication architecture at scale
  
  - Microsoft Graph API depth across multiple services
  
  - Security patterns for AI agent systems
  
  - How to navigate enterprise IT processes while shipping code
  
  **We are looking to fill this position as quickly as possible and are open to both freelance and permanent employment arrangements.**
  
  **FGS Global is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment and welcomes applicants from all backgrounds.**
