  ****About the role****
  
  At Everway, we're embedding AI directly into products that serve 250M+ users in education and accessibility. We're looking for a Senior AI/ML Developer to join our Product AI team and play a leading role in delivering production AI features that make a genuine difference to students, educators, and learners with diverse needs.
  
  This is a hands-on engineering role. You'll take AI features from concept through to deployment and monitoring :writing production-grade code, integrating with our product codebases, and owning the full lifecycle. We're not looking for someone who prototypes and hands off; you'll be the engineer who ships and supports your work in production.
  
  You'll work across multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, AWS Bedrock) as well as open-source models, selecting the right approach for each problem. You'll have the opportunity to build agentic workflows, and contribute to our evolving AI architecture. You'll collaborate directly with product and engineering teams to shape how AI capabilities are integrated across our portfolio.
  
  We have proprietary data, in-house expertise in linguistics and accessibility, and ambitious plans for what's next. You'll join a supportive team where mentorship flows both ways and where your contributions will directly shape products used at scale.
  ****Main Responsibilities****
  - **End-to-End Delivery:** Own the full lifecycle of AI projects-from ideation and data collection to production deployment and post-launch evaluation.
  
  - **Production Engineering:** Write well-designed, efficient, and testable code that integrates directly into product codebases
  
  - **Systems Integration:** Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) to connect LLMs with proprietary data sources and internal tools securely 
  
  - **Model Orchestration:** Scope and build Generative AI solutions using a mixture of SaaS (OpenAI, AWS Bedrock) and Open Source solutions.
  
  - **Scaling & Monitoring:** Work with development, QA, and infrastructure teams to scale and monitor AI solutions in production
  ****Essential Criteria****
  - 3+ years of experience  in a production ML/AI engineering role.
  
  - Proven experience writing production-grade Python code and deploying ML models at scale.
  
  - Ability to work cross-functionally and a track record of continuous learning in the rapidly evolving AI space
  
  - Hands-on experience building and deploying applications with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, AWS Bedrock)
  
  - Experience with open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama, Mistral) including deployment and/or fine-tuning
  
  - Demonstrated ability to take AI features from prototype through to production
  
  - Solid software engineering fundamentals - CI/CD, testing, containerisation, cloud deployment
  
  - Full lifecycle ML experience: data, training/prompting, evaluation, deployment, monitoring
  ****Desirable Criteria****
  - Experience working in an Agile development environment.
  
  - Experience building evaluation frameworks for LLM applications
  
  - Knowledge of AI governance, data protection, and responsible AI practices
