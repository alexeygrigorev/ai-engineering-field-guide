  AI Engineer, Open Platform
  
  The Technology & Engineering department at Future offers a
  collaborative, collegiate environment focused on delivering,
  well-engineered, and scalable solutions. We host regular
  hack days, emphasise best practices through technology-
  oriented guilds, and prioritise personal development with
  resources for learning.
  
  What you'll be doing
  
  This is a role within the new "Lab Squad" dedicated to
  building Open Platform (internally "Ember"), a scalable,
  creator-first ecosystem.
  
  As the AI Engineer, Open Platform, you will be the primary
  driver for designing and implementing the Auto-Moderation
  Service and other AI-driven capabilities that enable us to
  scale from dozens to thousands of creators safely. Your work
  will directly automate content ensure brand safety, and
  improve creator workflows using LLMs and automation
  frameworks.
  
  You will report into the Tech Lead and working with Full
  Stack Developers to embed intelligent agents and automated
  decision-making directly into the platform's core
  architecture.
  
  Experience that will put you ahead of the curve
  
  - Experience Level: Experience operating at a Mid to Senior
    level in a relevant technical role (Automation, Software
    Engineering, AI/ML Engineering).
  - Applied AI/ML Expertise: Hands-on experience applying AI/ML
    concepts (specifically NLP, LLMs, embeddings, and RAG) to
    solve practical business problems. You have a grasp of
    LLMOps and EVALs frameworks for rigorous model selection,
    quality assurance, and ongoing performance monitoring.
  - Agentic Systems Engineering: Expertise in designing
    autonomous agent architectures, including agent memory,
    strict safety guardrails, and task performance.
    Familiarity with frameworks like CrewAI, Google Gen
    AI/ADK, or LangGraph is important for building reliable,
    self-directing systems.
  - Automation Expertise: Experience designing and implementing
    process automation solutions using workflow tools
    (especially Temporal.io, n8n) or custom scripting to
    stitch AI models into business logic.
  - Programming Proficiency: Proficiency in Python (for AI/ML
    services) and TypeScript/Node.js (for integration). While
    we prioritise these languages, we value expertise in other
    high-level languages (Go, Java, PHP)
  - Software Engineering Practices: Understanding of modern best
    practices: version control (Git), CI/CD principles,
    automated testing, and writing clean, maintainable code.
  - System Integration: Ability to design AI services that
    integrate cleanly with modern web architectures
    (REST/GraphQL APIs, microservices) and existing platforms.
  - Personal Automation: Identify opportunities to automate
    personal workflows and tasks, showcasing a commitment to
    efficiency through the use of AI tools (e.g., Cursor,
    Windsurf, Copilot, and Bolt).
  - User Focus & Coaching: A customer-centric mindset, empathy
    for end-user needs, and a coaching approach with a
    willingness to share knowledge.
