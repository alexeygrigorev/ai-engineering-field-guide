  About PostHog
  
  We're shipping every product that companies need to run
  their business from their first day, to the day they IPO,
  and beyond. The operating system for folks who build
  software.
  
  We started with open-source product analytics, launched out
  of Y Combinator's W20 cohort. We've since shipped more than
  a dozen products, including:
  
  - A built-in data warehouse, so users can query product and
    customer data together using custom SQL insights.
  - A customer data platform, so they can send their data
    wherever they need with ease.
  - PostHog AI, an AI-powered analyst that answers product
    questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and
    writes custom SQL queries.
  
  Next on the roadmap are CRM, Workflow, revenue analytics,
  and support products. When we say every product that
  companies need to run their business, we really mean it!
  
  We are:
  
  - Product-led. More than 100,000 companies have installed
    PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely
    strong product-market fit.
  - Default alive. Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and
    we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and
    grow faster, not to keep the lights on.
  - Well-funded. We've raised more than $100m from some of the
    world's top investors. We're set up for a long, ambitious
    journey.
  
  We're focused on building an awesome product for end users,
  hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and being as
  weird as possible.
  
  Things we care about
  
  - Transparency: Everyone can read about our roadmap, how we
    pay (or even let go of) people, our strategy, and how we
    work, in our public company handbook. Internally, we share
    revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and
    fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need
    to make good decisions.
  - Autonomy: We don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses
    what to work on next based on what's going to have the
    biggest impact on our customers, and what they find
    interesting and motivating to work on. Engineers lead
    product teams and make product decisions. Teams are
    flexible and easy to change when needed.
  - Shipping fast: Why not now? We want to build a lot of
    products; we can't do that shipping at a normal pace.
    We've built the company around small teams – autonomous,
    highly-efficient groups of cracked engineers who can
    outship much larger companies because they own their
    products end-to-end.
  - Time for building: Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're
    a natively remote company. We default to async
    communication – PRs > Issues > Slack. Tuesdays and
    Thursdays are meeting-free days, and we prioritize heads
    down building time over perfect coordination. This will be
    the most productive job you've ever had.
  - Ambition: We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe
    that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes
    missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic
    about what's possible and our ability to get there.
  - Being weird: Weird means redesigning an already world-class
    website for the 5th time. It means shipping literally
    every product that relates to customer data. It means
    building an objectively unnecessary developer toy with
    dubious shareholder value. Doing weird stuff is a
    competitive advantage. And it's fun.
  
  Who we're looking for
  
  We’re looking for a full-stack engineer who knows how to
  leverage LLMs to make PostHog 10x more powerful. You’ve
  built and shipped agentic AI applications before and
  understand it’s more than just hitting an API with a good
  prompt.
  
  You’ll fit right in if you:
  
  - Ship end-to-end AI apps — from backend infra to frontend UX.
  - Collaborate widely — work across teams, find the right
    people, and make progress fast.
  - Think like a product builder — care about users and
    outcomes, not just code.
  
  If you’ve worked in autonomous agents, workflow automation,
  or AI copilots before, you’ll feel at home — but here you’ll
  get to build it from scratch, in the open, with massive
  impact.
  
  What makes this role unique
  
  In this role, you’re not hacking together an AI agent hoping
  someone will use it — you’re building on top of a firehose
  of real customer data with immediate impact, whether that
  means creating new AI-powered tools or building
  observability features that help others understand how their
  agents perform in the wild.
  
  - Impact from day one: You’re building agents on top of real
    customer data — not toy demos, not “when we get users.”
  - Data advantage: PostHog already collects all the context
    agents need to be useful: analytics, sessions, events,
    feature flags, and more. You’ll build on top of it all.
  - Agents that matter: Instead of copilots on the side, you’ll
    create background agents embedded into engineering
    workflows - changing how software gets built. Or, you
    might focus on building the analytics and observability
    layer around those agents - surfacing insights, clustering
    behaviors, and measuring model quality so teams can
    improve their own AI systems with confidence.
  - Build in the open: Work with feedback from the largest open-
    source product engineering communities in the world.
  
  What you'll be doing
  
  - Owning products and features from beginning to end. This
    means originating ideas based on your intuition, talking
    to users, and understanding our strategy and goals. It
    means testing MVPs in production with real users. It means
    iterating on their feedback, owning pricing, and ensuring
    the ongoing success of your work.
  - Collaborating with design (when necessary). Product
    engineers at PostHog are full-stack, so we expect you to
    ship and own the basic UX of your work using our design
    system. From there, it's up to you to decide when to
    collaborate with our design team to iterate and polish the
    experience.
  - Implementing AI features. LLMs, eh? They're getting
    prettaaay, prettaay good. All our products integrate with
    PostHog AI, so you'll likely be working with the PostHog
    AI team to implement AI features in your products. For
    some teams, that means designing observability and
    evaluation features for AI products.
  - Talking to users. Good product engineers read feedback from
    users and iterate quickly. Great product engineers have
    users they're friendly with, talk with them frequently,
    bounce ideas off them, and iterate with them when they
    ship new things.
  - Doing support. Every week, one person in each engineering
    team is designated the Support hero. Their job is to
    investigate and resolve issues reported by customers for
    their product. Giving users support from real engineers
    and shipping fixes and improvements in real-time is one of
    the best ways to spark joy in users. This role will also
    include some on-call time, too.
  - Writing docs. We have a content team that will collaborate
    with you on reviewing, polishing, and improving your
    documentation, but the best person to document a new
    feature is the person who built it.
  
  Requirements
  
  - Full-stack experience with relevant technologies – e.g.
    Python or similar, React or similar, something to do with
    big data is a bonus.
  - Prior experience in AI workflow automation, copilots, or
    autonomous agent products.
  - Ability to choose pragmatic architectures, ship quickly, and
    iterate based on real feedback.
  - Strong sense for UX and product polish.
  - Excellent communicator who thrives on collaboration across
    teams.
  
  Nice to have
  
  - Have worked at a high-growth SaaS company before.
  - Extensive knowledge of Django and/or TypeScript-based React.
  - Experience building AI-native products or integrating AI
    into existing software.
  
  If you have a disability, please let us know if there's any
  way we can make the interview process better for you - we're
  happy to accommodate!
