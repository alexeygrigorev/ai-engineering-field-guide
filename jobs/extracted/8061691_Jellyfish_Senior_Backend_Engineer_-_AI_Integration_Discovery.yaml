  AI tools are transforming how engineering teams work. AI code review tools like Greptile and Cursor Bug Bot are helping engineers catch more issues up front. AI coding assistants like Claude, Windsurf, and Cursor are helping engineers write higher quality code faster. Jellyfish is building the tools to measure that transformation. We're looking for a senior backend engineer excited to explore this space and define how we measure engineering productivity in the AI age.
  
  You'll join a team operating in uncharted territory. AI coding assistants are transforming how engineers work, but it’s not clear how to measure the impact yet. Your job is to help figure that out. You'll build features that capture AI adoption patterns, measure productivity changes, and help leaders understand what's actually improving outcomes versus what's just hype.
  
  This role demands someone who can move quickly without perfect information. You'll work from light specs because we're discovering the right solutions as we build. You’ll interact with top engineers from OpenAI, Amazon and other top-tier players as we work together to build integrations into the Jellyfish product. You need to deeply understand the business problems you're solving, not just implement requirements. Strong backend skills matter, but so does curiosity about AI's impact on software development and the ability to think through measurement challenges from first principles.
  
  The best candidates are senior backend engineers who get excited by ambiguity, iterate fast, and want to build products that define how we measure engineering work in an AI-transformed world.
  
  **Let's talk about what you'll do:**
  
  - 
  
  Design, plan and implement key features as part of a highly effective agile team
  
  -

  **Let's talk about what you need to excel:**

  7+ years of experience building SaaS products with a focus on Back End development
  
  - 
  
  Strong skills in Python, and passion for building production software systems using Django
  
  - 
  
  Enough experience with front-end frameworks such as React to be able to pitch in from time to time to move a project forward or troubleshoot issues.
  
  - 
  
  Strong skills in data modeling in relational database systems and experience with and interest in other database technologies such as columnar systems.
  
  - 
  
  Fluency with tools such as Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, Kiro and a track record of using them to build and ship fast.
  
  - 
  
  Experience with scaling, performance, and benchmarking of APIs and data processing systems.
  
  - 
  
  Have worked in or interested in a growth-stage startup

  - 
  
  Love learning new things and teaching others what you know
  
  - 
  
  Strong communication skills, and enjoy collaborative work
  
  A list of job experiences and qualification requirements is great, but humility, a performance-driven attitude, and a team-player approach are most important to us. We love to have fun and win in the process. We only hire people who have a passion for building great companies in an environment where a sense of humor is a must.
  
  Occasional travel may be required.
