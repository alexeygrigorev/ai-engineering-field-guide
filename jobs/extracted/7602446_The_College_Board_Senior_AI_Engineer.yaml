  About the Opportunity  
  
  This is a chance to have a direct hand in building the
  future of BigFuture, the most widely used college and career
  planning platform for students both in the mobile and web
  ecosystems. As a Full Stack Engineer on this team, you are a
  leader, collaborator, and innovator. You have a strong
  interest in understanding our stakeholders and leveraging
  new technologies to support them. We’re looking for a Senior
  AI Engineer to design and build next-generation user
  experiences powered by Generative AI. You’ll work across
  architecture, data, and product design to implement LLM-
  driven tools that personalize, automate, and enhance our
  users’ journeys. This role blends deep technical expertise
  with creativity and a product mindset — ideal for someone
  passionate about applying AI to real-world impact. From day
  one, you’ll be encouraged to mentor teammates, influence
  technical decisions, and help simplify complex problems so
  that students and educators experience fast, reliable, and
  meaningful tools. Beyond building products, this role offers
  you the opportunity to elevate engineering practices,
  explore emerging technologies like AI, and grow into a
  trusted technical leader whose work impacts millions of
  students each year. You are not shy about taking on new work
  you may not have done before while owning all phases of
  prototyping including requirements definition and analysis,
  application design, coding, reviewing, testing, deploying,
  and support. You are eager to lead by example as well as
  more formally through peer collaboration, coaching and
  mentoring.
  
  
  
  In this role, you will:
  
  Design and Development (60%)

  - Exercise discretion in prototyping: investing time to make
    sure the most important things work well, and working with
    the team to mock or minimize less important features
  
  - Maintain clean code and strong engineering standards such
    that when prototypes are greenlit for further development,
    the project is easy to build upon
  
  - Continuously develop the skills required to work with this

    precision, ensuring a smooth and reliable user experience.
  
  - Model discipline in adhering to development standards,
    security practices, and CI/CD principles while helping the
    team move fast without compromising quality.
  
  - Continuously grow your skills and embrace a poly-skilled
    environment where everyone contributes beyond their
    specialty.
  
  - Serve as an organizational Subject Matter Expert on

  - Serve as an advisor to internal teams developing staff
    education around Generative AI
