  - Deliver reliable, scalable, and robust automations with the appropriate evaluations, guardrails, human oversight, and clear performance monitoring.
  
  - Drive adoption by producing documentation, running hands-on training and enablement sessions for non-technical operators, and curating prompt libraries and playbooks that empower self-service iteration. 
  
  - Collaborate closely with Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Product Managers, Backend Engineers, and the AI Platform Team to ensure a comprehensive and coordinated approach to improving operational efficiency.
  
  - Embed safety, privacy, auditability, and responsible-AI standards into every workflow in partnership with Legal and Security teams.

  What We're Looking For****
  - Agentic & workflow-orchestration expertise:** Proven ability to design, build, and operate multi-step LLM agents with modern coordination frameworks.
  
  - **Applied AI engineering & prompt craft:** Deep Python skills plus hands-on experience integrating foundation models and crafting robust prompts and utilizing vector databases.
  
  - **Rapid prototyping & experimentation: **Comfortable shipping quick proofs of concept, running A/B or shadow launches, and iterating based on data.
  
  - **Backend, data-systems & tool integration:** Skilled at wiring external services and internal data into agent workflows through well-designed APIs and schemas.
  
  - **Human-in-the-loop system design:** Able to blend automation with human oversight through clear escalation paths, review checkpoints, and moderator tooling.
  
  - **Operator enablement & training: **Talent for translating technical workflows into clear, actionable training for non-technical teams and supporting their day-to-day adoption.
  
  - **Working through ambiguity: **Proven skill thriving in high-ambiguity, fast-moving environments-prioritizing effectively, adapting plans quickly, and delivering impact amid shifting requirements.
  **Prior Experience****
  - 7+ years of software or machine-learning engineering experience, with a recent focus on AI-driven automation or agentic systems.
  
  - 2+ years delivering solutions that combine automated decision support with human-in-the-loop review, ideally in Trust & Safety, customer support, or adjacent domains.
  
  - 2+ years designing and tracking operational metrics that demonstrate ROI, accuracy, and user-experience improvements for automated workflows.
  
  - 1+ years of hands-on work prototyping or operating agentic workflows (e.g., MCP, Agentspace, n8n) in real-world or open-source projects.
  
  - A degree in computer science, engineering, or a related field (or equivalent practical experience).
