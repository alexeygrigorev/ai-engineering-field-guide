  **The AI orchestration of your wildest imagination.**
  
  n8n is the open workflow orchestration platform built for the new era of AI. We give technical teams the freedom of code with the speed of no-code, so they can automate faster, smarter, and without limits. Backed by a fiercely inventive community and 500+ builder-approved integrations, we’re changing the way people bring systems together and scale ideas for impact.
  
  Since our founding in 2019, we’ve grown into a diverse team of over 160 - working across Europe and the US, connected by a shared builder spirit and with our centre of gravity in Berlin. Along the way, we’ve:
  
  - 
  
  Cultivated a community of more than 650,000 active developers and builders
  
  - 
  
  Earned 145k+ GitHub stars, making us one of the world’s Top 40 most popular projects
  
  - 
  
  Been ranked as one of Europe’s most promising privately held SaaS startups (4th in Sifted’s 2025 B2B SaaS Rising 100)
  
  - 
  
  Raised $240m to date, from Sequoia’s first German seed to our recent $180m Series C - bringing us to a $2.5bn valuation
  
  - 
  
  And are grateful for our 94 eNPS score (most companies would call 70 excellent)
  
  **That’s the company we’ve built. Now we’d love to see what *you *can build. If you’re applying, try n8n out - whether you’re technical or not - and share a screenshot of your first workflow with us. The easiest place to start is here: app.n8n.cloud/register.
