description: |
  Why work at Nebius Nebius is leading a new era in cloud
  computing to serve the global AI economy. We create the
  tools and resources our customers need to solve real-world
  challenges and transform industries, without massive
  infrastructure costs or the need to build large in-house
  AI/ML teams. Our employees work at the cutting edge of AI
  cloud infrastructure alongside some of the most experienced
  and innovative leaders and engineers in the field.
  
  Where we work Headquartered in Amsterdam and listed on
  Nasdaq, Nebius has a global footprint with R&D hubs across
  Europe, North America, and Israel. The team of over 800
  employees includes more than 400 highly skilled engineers
  with deep expertise across hardware and software
  engineering, as well as an in-house AI R&D team.
  
  The role
  
  This role is for Nebius AI R&D, a team focused on applied
  research in AI. Examples of applied research that we have
  recently published include:
  
  - applying reinforcement learning for agent training in long-
    context multi-turn scenarios
  - dramatically scaling task data collection to power
    reinforcement learning for SWE agents
  - building a decontaminated evaluation for SWE agents that is
    regularly updated
  - investigating how test-time guided search can be used to
    build more powerful agents
  
  The results often lead to collaboration with adjacent teams
  where our research findings are applied in practice.
  
  We are currently looking for senior- and staff-level ML
  engineers to work on research in areas such as:
  
  - Guided search and reinforcement learning for agentic systems
  - Reinforcement learning for reasoning models
  - Web-scale problem collection for training agents
  - Efficient model distillation
  
  Some examples of what your responsibilities might include
  are:
  
  - Conducting experiments to figure out efficient ways to train
    a large language model on traces of interactions with
    various environments
  - Exploring methods of guided generation and search in the
    trajectory space
  - Coming up with ways to mine relevant data at web scale and
    figuring out efficient ways to use this data in model
    post-training
  - Conducting experiments with different reinforcement learning
    configurations in verifiable domains
  - Exploring methods to train AI agents on tasks with non-
    verifiable reward signals
  
  We expect you to have:
  
  - A profound understanding of theoretical foundations of
    machine learning and reinforcement learning
  - Deep expertise in modern deep learning for language
    processing and generation
  - Substantial experience with training large models on
    multiple computational nodes
  - Strong software engineering skills (we mostly use python)
  - Deep experience with modern deep learning frameworks (we use
    jax)
  - Strong communication and leadership abilities
  - Experience designing, executing, and analyzing machine
    learning experiments with proper statistical rigor
  - Ability to formulate research questions, design experiments
    to test hypotheses, and draw meaningful conclusions from
    results
  - Ability to document research findings clearly and contribute
    to technical publications or report
  
  Nice to have:
  
  - Experience with deep reinforcement learning for LLMs,
    including techniques such as reward modeling, DPO, PPO etc
  - Familiarity with important ideas in LLM space, such as RoPE,
    ZeRO/FSDP, Flash Attention, quantization
  - Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Artificial
    Intelligence, Data Science, or a related field Master’s or
    PhD preferred
  - Track record of building and delivering products (not
    necessarily ML-related) in a dynamic startup-like
    environment
  - Experience in engineering complex systems, such as large
    distributed data processing systems or high-load web
    services
  - Open-source projects that showcase your engineering prowess
  - Excellent command of the English language, alongside
    superior writing, articulation, and communication skills
  - Proficiency in contemporary software engineering approaches,
    including CI/CD, version control and unit testing
  
  What we offer
  
  - Competitive salary and comprehensive benefits package.
  - Opportunities for professional growth within Nebius.
  - Flexible working arrangements.
  - A dynamic and collaborative work environment that values
    initiative and innovation.
  
  We’re growing and expanding our products every day. If
  you’re up to the challenge and are excited about AI and ML
  as much as we are, join us!
