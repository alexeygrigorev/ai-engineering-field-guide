description: |
  Waymo is an autonomous driving technology company with the
  mission to be the world's most trusted driver. Since its
  start as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009, Waymo
  has focused on building the Waymo Driver—The World's Most
  Experienced Driver™—to improve access to mobility while
  saving thousands of lives now lost to traffic crashes. The
  Waymo Driver powers Waymo’s fully autonomous ride-hail
  service and can also be applied to a range of vehicle
  platforms and product use cases. The Waymo Driver has
  provided over ten million rider-only trips, enabled by its
  experience autonomously driving over 100 million miles on
  public roads and tens of billions in simulation across 15+
  U.S. states.
  
  The mission of the Waymo AI Foundations team is to develop
  machine learning solutions addressing open problems in
  autonomous driving, towards the goal of safely operating
  Waymo vehicles in dozens of cities and under all driving
  conditions. As part of our work, we also initiate and foster
  collaborations with other research teams in Alphabet. AI
  Foundations areas that we are currently focusing on include
  reinforcement learning, learning from demonstration,
  generative modeling, Bayesian inference, hierarchical
  learning, and robust evaluation.
  
  This role follows a hybrid work schedule and you will report
  to a Senior Staff Software Engineer.
  
  You will:
  
  - Work with a creative team of people who help to design,
    train, and evaluate the large-scale ML models that are
    used throughout Waymo’s systems, both onboard autonomous
    vehicles and offboard in simulation.
  - Frame open-ended real-world problems as well-defined ML
    problems; develop and apply cutting-edge ML approaches
    (deep learning, reinforcement learning, imitation
    learning, etc) to these problems; scale them to Google-
    sized data pipelines; and streamline them to run in real-
    time on the cars.
  - Collaborate with other teams including the ML
    infrastructure, data science and systems engineering
    teams, as well as various research teams such as Waymo
    Research, Google Brain, DeepMind and academia.
  
  You have:
  
  - Good programming skills - Python, JAX, TensorFlow/PyTorch
  - Strong statistical / ML theoretical knowledge, and practical
    experience
  
  We prefer:
  
  - ML infra experience: training, evaluating and deploying ML
    models at scale
  - Deep learning experience, especially with generative models,
    e.g., LLMs/VLMs, and/or reinforcement learning or
    imitation learning
  - Autonomous driving experience
  
  The expected base salary range for this full-time position
  is listed below. Actual starting pay will be based on job-
  related factors, including exact work location, experience,
  relevant training and education, and skill level.  Waymo
  employees are also eligible to participate in Waymo’s
  discretionary annual bonus program, equity incentive plan,
  and generous Company benefits program, subject to
  eligibility requirements.
