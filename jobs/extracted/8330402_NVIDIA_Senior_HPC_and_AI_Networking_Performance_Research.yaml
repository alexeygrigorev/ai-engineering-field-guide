  NVIDIA is looking for a talented Performance Research and
  Analysis Engineer to join our Performance group. The ideal
  candidate will profile and analyze AI workloads on large
  GPUs and CPUs scale clusters for distributed Deep Learning
  LLM training and inference focusing at the communication
  patterns, collectives communication, RDMA, networking and
  system performance. You will work and interact with many
  types of HW platforms such as HCAs, Switches, CPUs, GPUs,
  Systems and also with various SW layers and features. You
  will experience with simulators and developing performance
  analysis tools and methodologies to dive deeply into the
  details, understand performance expectation, limitations,
  and bottlenecks as part of the root cause analysis of these
  jobs.
  
  What you'll be doing:
  
  - Experience and research AI workloads and DL models
    specifically tailored for large-scale deep learning LLM
    training on NVIDIA supercomputers with a focus on High-
    performance networking.
  - Benchmarking, Profiling, and Analyzing the performance to
    find bottlenecks and identify areas of improvement and
    optimizations, with a strong emphasis on networking
    aspects.
  - Implement performance analysis tools.
  - Collaborating with many teams from HW to SW to provide
    performance analysis insights.
  - Define performance test planning, set performance
    expectations for new technologies and solutions, and work
    to reach the performance targets limits.
  
  What we need to see:
  
  - B.Sc in Computer Science or Software Engineering
  - 6+ years of experience with high-performance Networking
    (RDMA, MPI, NCCL)
  - Demonstrated Performance Analysis skills and methodologies.
  - Experience with NVIDIA GPUs, CUDA library, deep learning
    frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch,
  - Combined with expertise in networking collective
    communication libraries (such as NCCL) and protocols (such
    as RoCE and RDMA).
  - Fast and self-learning capabilities with strong analytical
    and problem solving skills
  - Programming Languages: Python, Bash and C languages
  - Experience with Linux OS distros
  - Team player with good communication and interpersonal skills
  
  Ways to stand out from the crowd:
  
  - In-depth knowledge and experience with AI workloads
    benchmarking for distributed LLM training, CUDA, and NCCL
    libraries.
  - In-depth System knowledge and understanding (Intel / AMD /
    ARM CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, HCA, Memory, PCI)
  - Knowledge in Congestion Control algorithms
