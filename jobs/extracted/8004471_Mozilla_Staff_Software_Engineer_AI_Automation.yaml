  Why Mozilla?
  
  Mozilla Corporation is the non-profit-backed technology
  company that has shaped the internet for the better over the
  last 25 years. We make pioneering brands like Firefox, the
  privacy-minded web browser. Now, with more than 225 million
  people around the world using our products each month, we’re
  shaping the next 25 years of technology and helping to
  reclaim an internet built for people, not companies. Our
  work focuses on diverse areas including AI, social media,
  security and more. And we’re doing this while never losing
  our focus on our core mission – to make the internet better
  for people.
  
  The Mozilla Corporation is wholly owned by the non-profit
  501(c) Mozilla Foundation. This means we aren’t beholden to
  any shareholders — only to our mission. Along with thousands
  of volunteer contributors and collaborators all over the
  world, Mozillians design, build and distribute open-source
  software that enables people to enjoy the internet on their
  terms.
  
  About this team and role:
  
  Mozilla is seeking a Staff Software Engineer to lead the
  next evolution of Service Desk and digital workplace
  operations. This role goes beyond traditional IT support: it
  is centered on AI-driven service enablement, automation, and
  platform ownership.  
  
  You will be a single-threaded owner for key internal
  platforms and Enterprise AI-powered services, ensuring they
  deliver maximum value to the business. You’ll architect
  intelligent workflows, integrate SaaS and AI systems, and
  drive adoption across the organization — all while staying
  connected to the user experience through escalations,
  feedback loops, and advanced troubleshooting.  
  
  This is a lead-level role for someone who thrives at the
  intersection of technology, AI, security, and human
  experience — with deep experience in high-end Python
  scripting to build, scale, and maintain automation
  frameworks and integrations across Mozilla’s internal tools
  ecosystem.
  
  What You’ll Do:
  
  - Roll out new collaboration and Enterprise GenAI
    capabilities: run pilots, manage change/comms, create
    guides, and deliver training that drives adoption and
    safety.
  - Design and ship automations (scripts, workflows, chatbots,
    AI agents) to streamline provisioning/deprovisioning,
    entitlements, group lifecycle, and tier-1 deflection.
  - Build monitoring and alerting for SaaS health and key
    workflows; lead incident, problem, and change practices to
    reduce MTTR and prevent recurrences.
  - Define SLAs/SLOs, instrument CSAT and operational metrics,
    and run regular service reviews that turn data into
    improvements.
  - Serve as technical escalation for complex tickets: drive
    resolution, perform root-cause analysis, and capture
    knowledge to uplevel the Service Desk.
  - Maintain clean, current documentation: runbooks, KB
    articles, architecture diagrams, and admin playbooks.
  - Champion a 'shift-left' model: expand self-service portals,
    guided flows, and AI virtual agents to improve velocity
    and user experience.
  - Enterprise AI Security & Governance: implement guardrails
    for AI/automation usage, including access controls, data
    handling policies, compliance alignment, and ongoing risk
    monitoring.
  - Cross-Functional Partnership: collaborate with People,
    Security, Finance, Legal, and Procurement to ensure
    platforms align with organizational goals.
  - Vendor & Contract Management: lead relationships with SaaS
    and AI providers, negotiate terms, and ensure strong ROI.
  - Mentor & Lead: coach P3 engineers in automation, AI prompt
    engineering, and scalable integration design.
  
  What You’ll Bring:
  
  - 7+ years in IT engineering, enterprise applications, or
    service delivery.
  - ITIL 4 Foundations certification (required).
  - Comfortable leading incident, problem, and change management
    (ITIL), measuring SLAs/SLOs, and using data to drive
    continuous service improvements.
  - Demonstrated success owning platforms end-to-end, including
    lifecycle management, integrations, and adoption.
  - Advanced proficiency in Python scripting — with proven
    experience developing, optimizing, and maintaining
    automation frameworks, APIs/webhooks, and integration
    logic across enterprise tools.
  - Strong automation & scripting skills in one or more of:
    Python; with experience building APIs/webhooks, workflow
    engines, and chatbots.
  - Advanced experience in AI & automation platforms (GenAI
    copilots, RPA, intelligent workflows), including security
    and governance guardrails for safe adoption.
  - A builder’s mindset: bias for automation and documentation,
    empathy for end users, and a willingness to mentor Service
    Desk colleagues.
  - Strong program/project management skills with proven ability
    to independently deliver initiatives.
  - Ability to translate ambiguous business needs into
    structured, scalable solutions.
  - Leadership presence and credibility with executives and
    peers.
  - High tolerance for ambiguity with skill in bringing clarity
    and structure.
  
  What you’ll get:
  
  - Generous performance-based bonus plans to all eligible
    employees - we share in our success as one team
