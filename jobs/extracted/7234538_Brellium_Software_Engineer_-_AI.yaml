  About Brellium
  
  Brellium's mission is a big one – to improve the standard of
  care across the US healthcare system. We’ve built AI-powered
  technology that helps healthcare providers deliver safer,
  higher-quality care - starting with the first real-time
  medical review platform built to fix clinical and compliance
  risks before they impact patients. Each year, 1 in 20 people
  in the U.S. experiences a medical diagnostic or compliance-
  related mistake. Most providers lack the time, staffing, and
  tools to mitigate these issues - so they go unnoticed,
  impacting care quality and increasing clinical and financial
  risk. Brellium is building the AI-powered platform that
  helps providers deliver safer, more consistent care by
  mitigating risk early and aligning patient visits with
  clinical best practices. Our goal is to give every provider
  in the U.S. the tools to deliver clinically excellent, data-
  driven care - at scale. Brellium was founded in 2021. Since
  then, we’ve grown to serve over 250,000 providers across all
  50 states who use Brellium to take better care of their
  patients and ensure data-driven, compliant care. We’re a
  Series A company with over $16MM in funding from First Round
  Capital, Left Lane Capital, and Menlo Ventures.

  What it means to be "One of Us"
  
  Bias to Action: Brellium teammates do not wait to make
  reversible decisions or seek unnecessary approval. We
  quickly decide and move forward. If the decision was
  incorrect, we quickly reverse it and move forward.
  
  Thinks for themselves: Brellium teammates do not take things
  at face value. We ask "why" until base truth is reached. If
  a better solution is present, Brellium teammates use it,
  regardless of status quo.
  
  Negative Maintenance: The opposite of high maintenance isn’t
  low maintenance - it’s negative maintenance. Brellium
  teammates are poised under pressure, self-motivated, self-
  improving, self-disciplined, self-aware, and non-defensive.
  
  Expect Excellence: We hold ourselves to exceptionally high
  and continuously rising standards. We strive for
  thoughtfulness in our decision making, and for speed and
  quality in our execution. We acknowledge trade-offs and
  communicate proactively.
  
  Communicate with Clarity: Brellium teammates communicate
  concisely, directly, and purposefully. We optimize for
  ensuring our points are easily understood the first time.
  
  We are aware of fraudulent job offers claiming to be from
  Brellium. All legitimate communication comes from
  brellium.com, or no-reply@ashbyhq.com, and we will never ask
  for money or sensitive personal information as part of our
  hiring process. If there are any questions please direct
  them to peter@brellium.com
