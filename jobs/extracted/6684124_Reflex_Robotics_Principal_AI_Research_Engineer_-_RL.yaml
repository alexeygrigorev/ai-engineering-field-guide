  Company Overview
  
  Reflex Robotics is building affordable ($10k) wheeled
  humanoid robots to automate dangerous and repetitive tasks
  in manufacturing and logistics.
  
  We envision a future where intelligent robots are doing all
  kinds of boring work that people hate doing—loading chicken
  nuggets into Costco boxes, lifting forty pound bags of dog
  food at Petco stores, and cleaning up cranberry juice spills
  in your apartment.
  
  We are a three-year-old startup backed by Khosla Ventures,
  with $60M/year of revenue lined up pending successful pilots
  with e-commerce warehouses in 2025.
  
  How Does It Work?
  
  Our robots are designed and built entirely in-house by an
  engineering team that led development of the Stretch robot
  at Boston Dynamics and key systems on the Tesla Model S, X,
  and Y production lines. Reflex robots are high-performance,
  low-inertia, and optimized for low-cost manufacturing.
  
  We’ve built the best real-time teleoperation system in the
  world, allowing a remote operator in South America to “play
  a video game” to control our robots at human-level speeds.
  This has allowed us to already ship robots with positive
  unit economics, and enables us to create a powerful human-
  intervention + RL product feedback loop.
  
  Our system allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations
  at scale—giving us the proprietary data engine needed to
  train increasingly capable AI systems. We're on track to
  build the largest robotics dataset in the world, which will
  serve as an important long-term advantage.
  
  Key Company Beliefs
  
  - High-quality, proprietary robotics data is the next
    foundation for generational AI companies (like Tesla FSD
    and ChatGPT).
  - Being nerd-sniped by maximizing an engineering metric is way
    less important than solving our customers’ biggest pain
    points.
  - An insane work ethic is required for outsized success—and
    you'll be rewarded for it.
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  We’re looking for stellar on-policy RL engineers to work on
  creating robust robot policies.
  
  We’re still a small team—which means high ownership, high
  equity, and the chance to shape the product from the ground
  up.
  
  VLAs and other great “base policies” for robotics achieve
  ~80% success rates, but in real robot deployments, it’s
  essential to achieve 99.99% success rates. We can’t ask our
  customers to tolerate our robots packing three socks into a
  bin instead of four, or swapping shipping labels between two
  packages—not even once! You should apply for this role if:
  
  - You’ve re-implemented core RL algorithms (SAC, DDPG) from
    scratch and can debug unstable gradients / tune
    hyperparameters correctly
  - You’ve made meaningful intellectual contributions to sample-
    efficient RL algorithms (e.g., DreamerV3 and MuZero)
  - You’ve shipped on-policy RL on hardware that learns in the
    real-world (e.g., for quadruped walking or drone racing)
  
  You’d be joining a company that already has a solid core
  business—with working hardware, delighted customers, and
  profitable unit economics. Reflex is de-risked enough to see
  the hazy outlines of success, but still small enough that
  there’s enormous upside up for grabs.
  
  Come Join Us
  
  This is a rare opportunity to help build a flagship robotics
  company from the ground up—and to do work that will truly
  matter, reshaping what people believe is possible in
  robotics.
  
  We love to see the things you’ve worked on. Have a portfolio
  or insane project you’ve worked on? Share it. We’re looking
  for people who push past the status quo, are passionate at
  work and in their own time—we’re looking for people who want
  to win.
