  At WISEcode, we're a well-funded, dynamic startup. WISEcode
  makes personalized nutrition a reality based on the facts –
  what truly is in our food — and marries this data with your
  preferences. Powered by AI and the world’s best food and
  nutrition database, WISEcode embraces the fact that we are
  all different, have different dietary needs, objectives, and
  preferences, and should not be at the mercy of market spin
  or “expert” opinion. Every one of us should have the
  information we need to make the best decisions for
  ourselves.
  
  The Opportunity
  
  WISEcode doesn’t hire for incremental impact — we hire for
  force multipliers. Our Principal Engineers are restless
  builders who transform complexity into clarity, elevate
  every team they touch, and create architecture that
  accelerates the entire company. These are strategic
  technologists who see systems where others see fragments,
  who bring long-term thinking into every decision, and who
  translate bold ideas into elegant, scalable solutions that
  endure beyond their original use cases.
  
  About the Role
  
  The Principal Engineer (PE) is WISEcode’s highest-impact
  individual-contributor role — a technical leader who
  combines deep hands-on engineering with clear architectural
  ownership and accountability across major parts of the
  platform. PEs write excellent code, but also define system
  boundaries, long-term technical direction, and engineering
  standards that influence the entire organization over time.
  
  While this Principal Engineer role operates at a platform
  and systems level, this position is anchored in WISEcode’s
  AI, intelligence, and reasoning layers and requires deep,
  opinionated expertise in designing systems that combine
  probabilistic intelligence with deterministic software
  foundations.
  
  A WISEcode PE is both strategist and builder. You will:
  
  Translate product ideas, domain concepts, and company vision
  into intelligent systems that reason over food, ingredients,
  nutrition, and user preferences.
  
  Design and implement AI-powered features end-to-end,
  including model selection, orchestration, inference
  pipelines, confidence handling, and integration with product
  workflows.
  
  
  
  Guide teams through decisions on model tradeoffs, data
  quality, evaluation strategies, observability,
  explainability, and long-term system evolution.
  
  Influence without authority — shaping engineering culture,
  mentoring senior engineers, and raising the organizational
  bar for how intelligence is built and trusted.
  
  PEs at WISEcode operate as a flexible, high-impact bench.
  You may embed temporarily into a product, data, or platform
  team to accelerate an AI-heavy initiative, resolve
  architectural ambiguity, or establish a new intelligence
  capability. You’ll then step out, leaving behind reusable
  patterns, clear interfaces, and higher organizational
  confidence in intelligent systems.
  
  Because of their breadth, PEs typically work closely with
  the CTO and maintain visibility across products, data
  systems, and infrastructure. Your success is measured not by
  individual model performance alone, but by the reliability,
  interpretability, and usefulness of intelligence across the
  entire WISEcode ecosystem.
  
  How Principal Engineers Operate at WISEcode
  
  Systems thinkers with depth. PEs bring T-shaped skills: deep
  expertise in AI systems, model integration, and intelligent
  workflows, combined with broad understanding across data
  modeling, software architecture, product experience, and
  infrastructure.
  
  Architects who execute. You can design an inference
  pipeline, integrate LLMs or ML models into production
  systems, implement evaluation and monitoring loops, and
  understand how these components must evolve over time as
  data, models, and use cases change.
  
  Product-savvy technologists. PEs help shape product
  direction, not just implement requirements. You anticipate
  how intelligent behavior affects user trust, explainability,
  personalization, and long-term product differentiation, and
  help frame product decisions through technical clarity.
  
  Pragmatic long-term thinkers. You balance speed of
  experimentation with architectural integrity. You know when
  probabilistic systems are appropriate and when deterministic
  computation is required.
  
  Multipliers. You leave teams stronger: clearer intelligence
  patterns, better evaluation practices, safer AI usage, and
  faster future delivery that does not depend on your constant
  involvement.
  
  AI Skills and Leadership
  
  • WISEcode is an AI-native company. Every engineer is
  expected to use AI well, but PEs set the standard. You will:
  
  • Design AI systems that combine LLMs, traditional ML,
  rules, and deterministic logic into coherent, testable
  workflows
  
  • Establish practices for evaluation, monitoring, and
  iteration that make intelligent systems reliable and
  trustworthy over time.
  
  • Understand how data quality, prompt design, retrieval
  strategies, and system architecture affect model behavior
  
  • Advocate for responsible, transparent, and explainable AI
  that aligns with WISEcode’s mission of consumer trust and
  empowerment.
  
  AI is not a bolt-on at WISEcode — it is a horizontal
  capability. PEs ensure intelligence is embedded thoughtfully
  into products, workflows, and decision-making without
  sacrificing correctness or clarity.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  • Own architecture for AI and intelligence systems across
  model integration, inference pipelines, evaluation
  frameworks, and product interfaces.
  
  • Lead solution design for high-complexity, AI-driven
  initiatives and deliver production-ready implementations
  when needed.
  
  • Define patterns and standards for safe, observable, and
  explainable AI usage across teams
  
  • Diagnose and resolve issues across data inputs, model
  behavior, system integration, and user-facing outcomes.
  
  • Guide decisions on model selection, orchestration, cost-
  performance tradeoffs, and system scalability.
  
  • Mentor senior engineers and elevate engineering culture
  around intelligent system design
  
  • Partner closely with product, data, CTO, and platform
  teams to shape roadmap feasibility and long-term
  intelligence strategy.
  
  • Apply AI techniques in ways that improve personalization,
  understanding, automation, and developer productivity.
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  • BSCS or equivalent engineering degree
  
  • 12+ years of strong professional development experience
  
  • Demonstrated ownership of production AI or intelligence
  systems whose behavior, reliability, and evolution you were
  personally responsible for over time
  
  • Strong software engineering background with experience
  integrating AI or ML into real-world systems
  
  • Experience working with LLMs, ML models, or hybrid
  intelligence approaches in production environments
  
  • Ability to reason about probabilistic systems, evaluation
  metrics, and tradeoffs between accuracy, cost, and user
  trust
  
  • Track record of technical leadership, mentoring, and
  cross-team influence as an individual contributor
  
  • Ability to operate independently, set direction, and drive
  execution in ambiguous or exploratory contexts
  
  • Broad systems thinking with depth in AI, data, and
  software architecture
  
  • Startup mindset — adaptability, urgency, pragmatism, and
  comfort shifting between experimentation and production
  delivery
  
  Why Join WISEcode
  
  • Build the intelligence layer for one of the most ambitious
  food-tech and AI platforms in the world.
  
  • Work directly with the founder and CTO in a fast-moving,
  mission-driven environment.
  
  • Shape how AI is responsibly applied to personalized
  nutrition at scale.
  
  • Competitive compensation, benefits, and opportunities for
  rapid growth and leadership.
