  ****about us**
  **
  
  At telli, we're building the first **AI-native phone system.**
  
  Since launching last year at Y Combinator (the same investors behind Airbnb, Stripe, Twitch, Coinbase, and others), we've grown **>$2M in annualized revenue** with a team of only 12 people.
  
  Today, many companies fail in their customer communication not because they don't care, but because they can't keep up. The sheer volume of calls forces to rely on low-quality outsourced call centers or have their internal teams waste hours on repetitive calls.
  
  With telli, our customers now rely on AI voice agents that handle their repetitive calls, freeing human to focus on what matters - talking to customers when it counts. The result: higher efficiency, happier teams, and better customer experiences.
  
  Legacy phone systems weren’t designed for an AI-first world. That is why **we are building the first AI-native phone system** that lets companies manage both their human and AI teams on one platform.
  
  Our founding team knows this problem inside-out. We ran a 150-person internal call center at Enpal. We know how difficult and expensive it is to scale high-quality customer experience with phone calls.
  
  The opportunity is massive!!! and we're just getting started. We're on a mission to let every company provide a world-class customer experience by **ending the era of low-quality call centers.**

  **about the role****
  
  This is the perfect role for someone with an engineering background (e.g. CS degree, coding bootcamp, or business informatics) who wants to apply their technical skills in a hands-on, customer-facing environment.**AI voice agents are transforming how companies communicate with customers, but integrating them into existing workflows is still complex.
  
  As a **Customer Engineer at telli**, you’ll sit at the intersection of **customer success, support, and engineering**. You’ll help our customers design, deploy, and scale AI agents that handle thousands of real customer calls every day.
  
  You’ll become the go-to technical partner for our customers - solving problems, improving performance, and bringing feedback directly to our product and engineering teams.
