  Who we are
  
  Helsing is a defence AI company. Our mission is to protect
  our democracies. We aim to achieve technological leadership,
  so that open societies can continue to make sovereign
  decisions and control their ethical standards.
  
  As democracies, we believe we have a special responsibility
  to be thoughtful about the development and deployment of
  powerful technologies like AI. We take this responsibility
  seriously.
  
  We are an ambitious and committed team of engineers, AI
  specialists and customer-facing programme managers. We are
  looking for mission-driven people to join our European teams
  – and apply their skills to solve the most complex and
  impactful problems. We embrace an open and transparent
  culture that welcomes healthy debates on the use of
  technology in defence, its benefits, and its ethical
  implications.
  
  The role
  
  At Helsing we deliver AI-based capabilities and the enabling
  foundation that allow machines to perceive and assist human
  decision-making. You will have the unique opportunity to
  shape AI capabilities in one of the most challenging
  sectors, where high generalisation capabilities need to be
  paired with hardware constraints and robustness against
  adversarial attacks.
  
  You will be a part of a team focused on advancing robotics
  through reinforcement learning, where you will design, train
  and deploy agents to be deployed in robots in complex
  environments.
  
  The day-to-day
  
  - You will contribute to our reinforcement learning stack by
    implementing, improving and extending the current state of
    the art in multi-agent reinforcement learning.
  - You will contribute to projects and will collaborate with
    people across several teams and backgrounds.
  
  You should apply if you
  
  - Hold an MSc in machine learning with a speciality in either
    robotics, reinforcement learning, or automation and
    control.
  
  - Have excellent communication skills and the ability to
    report and present research findings clearly and
    efficiently both internally and externally.
  - Are passionate about keeping up to date with current
    research and enjoy reimplementing / extending papers on
    state of the art Deep Learning-based approaches.
  - Possess solid software engineering skills, writing clean and
    well-structured code in Python and/or languages like Rust,
    Java, or modern C++, and experience deploying AI software
    to production including testing, QA, and monitoring.
  
  Note: We operate at an intersection where women, as well as
  other minority groups, are systematically under-represented.
  We encourage you to apply even if you don’t meet all the
  listed qualifications; ability and impact cannot be
  summarised in a few bullet points.
  
  Nice to have
  
  - PhD in robotics, reinforcement learning, or automation and
    control, or related fields and have authored publications
    in top-tier journals and conferences (eg, NeurIPS, CoRL,
    ICLR, ICRA).
  - Experience with deploying RL models into real-world robotics
    platforms.
  - Experience in design, physical modeling and control of
    complex and highly interactive robotic systems using
    state-of-the-art tools and techniques.
  - Experience deploying AI software to production including
    testing, quality assurance, and monitoring.
  
  Join Helsing and work with world-leading experts in their
  fields
  
  - Helsing’s work is important. You’ll be directly contributing
    to the protection of democratic countries while balancing
    both ethical and geopolitical concerns.
  - The work is unique. We operate in a domain that has highly
    unusual technical requirements and constraints, and where
    robustness, safety, and ethical considerations are vital.
    You will face unique Engineering and AI challenges that
    make a meaningful impact in the world.
  - Our work frequently takes us right up to the state of the
    art in technical innovation, be it reinforcement learning,
    distributed systems, generative AI, or deployment
    infrastructure. The defence industry is entering the most
    exciting phase of the technological development curve.
    Advances in our field of world are not incremental:
    Helsing is part of, and often leading, historic leaps
    forward.
  - In our domain, success is a matter of order-of-magnitude
    improvements and novel capabilities. This means we take
    bets, aim high, and focus on big opportunities. Despite
    being a relatively young company, Helsing has already been
    selected for multiple significant government contracts.
  - We actively encourage healthy, proactive, and diverse debate
    internally about what we do and how we choose to do it.
    Teams and individual engineers are trusted (and
    encouraged) to practise responsible autonomy and critical
    thinking, and to focus on outcomes, not conformity. At
    Helsing you will have a say in how we (and you!) work, the
    opportunity to engage on what does and doesn’t work, and
    to take ownership of aspects of our culture that you care
    deeply about.
  
  What we offer
  
  - A focus on outcomes, not time-tracking
  - Competitive compensation and stock options
  - Relocation support
  - Social and education allowances
  - Regular company events and all-hands to bring together
    employees as one team across Europe
  - A hands-on onboarding program (affectionately labelled “AI-
    duction”), in which you will be familiarising yourself
    with our tools and ML pipelines used across the company.
    This is your opportunity to learn our tech stack, explore
    the company, and learn how we get things done - all whilst
    working with other AI and engineering teams from day one
  
  Helsing is an equal opportunities employer. We are committed
  to equal employment opportunity regardless of race,
  religion, sexual orientation, age, marital status,
  disability or gender identity. Please do not submit personal
  data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
  religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership,
  data concerning your health, or data concerning your sexual
  orientation.
