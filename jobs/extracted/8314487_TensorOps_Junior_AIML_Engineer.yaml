  **Build the Next Generation of AI Products with TensorOps**
  
  TensorOps is an applied machine learning and artificial intelligence studio helping organizations worldwide plan, design, train, and deploy production-grade ML systems. Our clients range from NASDAQ-listed enterprises to seed-stage startups. Projects span from small proofs-of-concept to multi-year strategic initiatives.
  
  **What We’re Working On:**
  
  - Generative AI applications: Chatbots and Agents
  
  - Traditional Machine Learning: Time Series Forecasting, AdTech, Computer Vision, etc.
  
  - MLOps: Improving ML pipelines at scale
  
  **The Role:
  **We’re looking for a **Junior Machine Learning Engineer** to help us deliver state of the art projects. You’ll report to and be mentored by a senior team member. This is a hands-on role from day one, working on real projects that make a tangible impact.
  
  **Core Stack:**

  **Preferred Qualifications:**
  
  - BSc in Computer Science, Software Engineering or equivalent
  
  - MSc in Computer Science, Data Science, AI or equivalent
  
  **Required Skills:**
  
  - Solid software engineering fundamentals (OOP, Git, concurrency, parallelism)
  
  - Proficiency in Python
  
  - Understanding of LLM system design (RAG, agents, etc.)
  
  - Knowledge of ML system design (pipelines, training/inference techniques)
  
  - Excellent English communication skills
  
  **Nice to Have:**

  - Previous LLM projects (academic or otherwise)
  
  - Exposure to AI features in cloud platforms (Sagemaker, Bedrock, Vertex AI)
  
  - Experience working in large codebases
  
  **Why TensorOps?**
  
  - Fully remote (legal residence in Portugal required)
  
  - Real-world projects, rapid feedback loops, and measurable impact
  
  - Mentorship from engineers who have shipped ML systems at scale
  
  - Competitive compensation and growth opportunities - your growth will be based on ownership and performance rather than periodic reviews (which we still do)
  
  **Compensation & Perks:**
  
  - Yearly salary: €30,000-35,000
  
  - Travel expenses allowance
  
  - Urban Sports Club membership

  **What happens next **
  
  If your application is selected, our HR team will reach out to invite you to an initial conversation with our recruitment team.
  
  If successful, you’ll move on to a technical interview. This interview does not involve live coding or a take-home assignment.
  
  The final step is a conversation with the hiring manager.
  
  We do our best to carefully review all applications and respond to every candidate. While this isn’t always possible due to volume, we truly appreciate the time and effort you put into applying.
  
  *If you’re excited about this role but don’t meet every requirement, we still encourage you to apply, especially if you’re from an underrepresented group.*
