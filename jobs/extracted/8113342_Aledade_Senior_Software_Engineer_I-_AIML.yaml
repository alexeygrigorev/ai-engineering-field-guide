description: |
  As a Senior Software Engineer I at Aledade, we maintain,
  improve, and expand our web application and data pipelines.
  We're looking for engineers who know that writing new code
  is not always the solution to a problem, but when
  technological changes are needed they create secure,
  maintainable, performant, correct, scalable, and stable
  solutions to the complex and unique challenges in our corner
  of the healthcare industry.
  
  They embrace strategies that minimize risk, leaning towards
  observability, alerting, metrics, high test coverage, and
  frequent releases that incrementally build value.
  
  Primary Duties:
  
  - Develop and implement scalable and performant solutions.
  - Partner, as a peer, with Engineering Managers, Product
    Managers, and stakeholders throughout Aledade to develop
    and execute technical roadmaps using Agile processes.
  - Mentor and coach more junior engineers including thorough
    pull request reviews for other developers and be receptive
    to critical feedback on your own work.
  
  Minimum Qualifications:
  
  - BS/BTech (or higher) in Computer Science, Engineering or a
    related field.
  - 4+ years experience as an engineer building full-stack web
    applications as part of a cross-functional team.
  - 3+ years of experience working with SQL or other database
    querying language on large multi-table data sets.
  - 2+ years of experience acting as a trusted technical
    decision-maker in a team setting, solving for short-term
    and long-term business value.
  - 2+ years of experience coaching other engineers.
  
  Preferred KSA’s:
  
  - Proficiency in machine learning algorithms and techniques.
  - Experience in deploying machine learning models into
    production environments.
  - Expertise with statistical data techniques (such as causal
    inference, syntactic analysis, sampling methods, NLP etc),
    with experience in addressing challenges from incomplete,
    unrepresentative, and mislabeled data.
  - Experience with cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure
    or Google Cloud.
  - Experience with security and systems that handle sensitive
    data.
  
  Physical Requirements:
  
  - Sitting for prolonged periods of time. Extensive use of
    computers and keyboard. Occasional walking and lifting may
    be required.
