  Join the team leading the next evolution of virtual care.
  
  At Teladoc Health, you are empowered to bring your true self
  to work while helping millions of people live their
  healthiest lives.
  
  Here you will be part of a high-performance culture where
  colleagues embrace challenges, drive transformative
  solutions, and create opportunities for growth. Together,
  we’re transforming how better health happens.
  
  Summary of Position
  
  As a Principal Software Engineer, you will be a key leader
  within our engineering team, responsible for providing
  technical direction, overseeing project execution, and
  ensuring the highest standards of engineering excellence.
  You will play a pivotal role in driving innovation,
  implementing best practices, and guiding the development of
  cutting-edge solutions. This position offers an exciting
  opportunity to lead and mentor a team of engineers,
  collaborate closely with cross-functional teams, and
  contribute to the strategic vision of the company.
  
  This role is a mix of deep implementation work and technical
  leadership by example. You’ll spend a large portion of your
  time writing code, reviewing changes, and unblocking the
  team, while also shaping architecture, standards, and long-
  term technical decisions.
  
  Essential Duties and Responsibilities
  
  - Lead technical design for platform features and services,
    breaking ambiguous requirements into clear, incremental
    designs and stories for your team and adjacent partners.
  - Implement backend services in Python/FastAPI and React
    frontends end-to-end, owning a continuous stream of
    stories from idea to production.
  - Define and use clear API contracts and data flows between
    services and UIs, creating patterns and templates others
    can follow.
  - Champion high-quality engineering practices, including code
    reviews, documentation, and maintainable, testable
    designs.
  - Establish and evolve automated testing approaches (unit,
    integration, end-to-end) and incorporate them into
    everyday development.
  - Establish CI/CD pipelines and release workflows so the team
    can ship small, safe changes frequently and confidently.
  - Own the operational lifecycle of the features and services
    you build, including monitoring, observability, on-call
    participation, and incident follow-up.
  - Design and implement secure-by-default solutions, including
    robust authentication/authorization, input validation, and
    safe handling of sensitive data.
  - Identify and address reliability and performance risks
    early, proposing concrete technical improvements and
    sequencing them into the roadmap.
  - Provide hands-on technical leadership and mentorship to
    other engineers, helping them grow their impact and
    autonomy through pairing, design discussions, and
    feedback.
  - Sets technical decision frameworks used across teams; aligns
    directors/PMs on investment strategy; resolves cross‑team
    conflicts with data and clear rationale.
  
  The time spent on each responsibility reflects an estimate
  and is subject to change dependent on business needs.

  Required Qualifications
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or
    related field; equivalent work experience is acceptable.
  - 10+ years of experience in software engineering, with a
    proven track record of leading and delivering large-scale,
    complex projects.
  - Strong proficiency with Python and modern web backends
    (FastAPI, Flask, Django, or similar) and solid
    understanding of HTTP, API design, and data modeling.
  - Significant experience with React (or a comparable SPA
    framework) and building production frontends that talk to
    backend APIs.
  - Demonstrated ability to own features end-to-end: from
    shaping requirements through design, implementation,
    testing, deployment, and support.
  - Experience designing and working with distributed systems or
    multi-service architectures (e.g., service boundaries,
    async jobs, integration patterns).
  - Solid understanding of observability and operations for
    production systems (metrics, logs, traces, dashboards,
    alerting, incident response).
  - Strong understanding of security fundamentals
    (authentication, authorization, secure data handling) and
    how they apply to web services and UIs.
  - Deep familiarity with automated testing and CI/CD, and a
    track record of improving engineering workflows and
    quality.
  - Excellent communication and collaboration skills;
    comfortable working closely with product, design, and
    other stakeholders.
  - Proven ability to provide technical leadership in a hands-on
    way: unblocking others, making clear decisions, and
    raising the bar through code and reviews.
  
  Bonus Qualifications
  
  - Experience in early-stage or small platform teams where
    engineers wear multiple hats and balance shipping with
    building foundations.
  - Experience with Azure and containerized deployments (or
    similar cloud-native environments).
  - Experience building platforms (developer platforms, data
    platforms, or similar) that serve multiple product teams.
  - Exposure to AI/ML or data-intensive applications (e.g.,
    integrating with model inference APIs, data pipelines, or
    analytical data stores).
