description: |
  We believe that mental health is just as important as physical health. We recognize that mental health issues can be complex and multifaceted, and we are dedicated to treating the whole person, not just the symptoms.
  
  We aim to create a world where mental health is no longer stigmatized or marginalized, but rather is embraced as an integral part of one's overall well-being. 
  
  We believe that by providing quality care that is both evidence-based and compassionate, we can empower individuals to take charge of their mental health and achieve their full potential. We are passionate about making a positive impact on the lives of those struggling with mental health issues and we strive to be a force for positive change in the field of mental healthcare.
  
  Rula is a remote-first company. We currently hire in most U.S. states, with the exception of Hawaii.
  
  **About the Role**
  
  At Rula, we’re building AI with purpose. Our work sits at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and human empathy, focused on one goal: creating a future where high-qualty mental healthcare is the standard for all. To bring this to life, we’re bringing AI-assisted therapy that supports, not replaces, providers, helps patients get the right care faster, and raises the standard for what compassionate digital care can be.
  
  As a Staff AI Engineer - AI Foundation, you’ll define the core technical systems that make this possible. You’ll architect and scale production-grade Generative AI powering patient conversations, provider decision support, and clinical operations. From RAG pipelines and multi-agent orchestration to LLM integrations, vector search, and evaluation frameworks, you’ll build the infrastructure that turns experimentation into reliable, real-world impact in healthcare.
  
  This role is both deeply hands-on and highly influential. You’ll work across AI research, platform engineering, product, and clinical teams to design systems that are safe, observable, and built for scale in a regulated environment. You’ll set technical direction, mentor other engineers, and help shape Rula’s AI roadmap, leading at the frontier of AI and healthcare, where your work directly contributes to better outcomes and meaningful change in people’s lives.

  - 
  
  1+ years of proven track record building production-grade AI systems, such as training, inference, evaluation, and safeguards that power AI product features at scale
  
  - 
  
  Strong expertise in LLM integration patterns (RAG, function calling, agents, memory routing, etc.), AI orchestration frameworks (eg. LangChain, LlamaIndex, DSPy, Haystack), and vector databases (eg. Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS, Milvus).
  
  - 
  
  Deep understanding of AIOps, data pipelines, evaluation, and observability systems for continuous model improvement.
  
  - 
  
  Strong and effective communication skills.
