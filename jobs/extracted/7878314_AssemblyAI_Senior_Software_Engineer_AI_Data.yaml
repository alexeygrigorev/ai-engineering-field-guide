  ****About AssemblyAI****AssemblyAI builds the best-in-class Speech AI models powering the next generation of voice applications. Our models serve 600M+ inference calls monthly, process 1M+ hours of audio daily, and power 2 billion+ end-user experiences—from voice agents and meeting assistants to contact centers and medical scribes. Companies like Zoom, Granola, Fireflies, Cluely, and Calabrio rely on AssemblyAI to ship production-ready voice AI.
  
  We're at an inflection point in Speech AI. We released Universal-Streaming in mid-2025, and it has quickly earned its place as the model offering the best accuracy-latency-cost tradeoff on the market. The adoption has been significant: we now process ~1.5M streaming hours per week, with 25x usage growth in the last six months alone. Our research team drives these advances and ships with relentless velocity. Since releasing Universal-Streaming, we've already launched keyterms prompting feature and multilingual support—with more significant improvements on the roadmap.
  
  We've raised $115M+ from Accel, Insight Partners, Y Combinator's AI Fund, Patrick and John Collison, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross. We're a remote team building one of the next great AI companies—and we're looking for researchers who will shape its future.
