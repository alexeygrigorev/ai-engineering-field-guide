  Who is Flock?
  
  Flock Safety is the leading safety technology platform,
  helping communities thrive by taking a proactive approach to
  crime prevention and security. Our hardware and software
  suite connects cities, law enforcement, businesses, schools,
  and neighborhoods in a nationwide public-private safety
  network. Trusted by over 5,000 communities, 4,500 law
  enforcement agencies, and 1,000 businesses, Flock delivers
  real-time intelligence while prioritizing privacy and
  responsible innovation.
  
  We’re a high-performance, low-ego team driven by urgency,
  collaboration, and bold thinking. Working at Flock means
  tackling big challenges, moving fast, and continuously
  improving. It’s intense but deeply rewarding for those who
  want to make an impact.
  
  With nearly $700M in venture funding and a $7.5B valuation,
  we’re scaling intentionally and seeking top talent to help
  build the impossible. If you value teamwork, ownership, and
  solving tough problems, Flock could be the place for you.
  
  The Opportunity
  
  We’re hiring a Staff. AI Systems Engineer to help support
  our emerging product, Night Shift, an AI research assistant
  that amplifies the impact of investigators by automating the
  tedious, repetitive steps involved in working a case. This
  role sits within the Machine Learning team and will work
  closely with partners in Engineering (Backend, Frontend, and
  Design) in a fast-paced environment. You will be one of the
  earliest technical contributors to our system architecture
  for agentic AI, and will own our AI evaluation framework.
  The outcome we’re after is clear and ambitious: measurably
  faster, more accurate leads for every officer and every
  shift.
  
  The Skillset
  
  Familiarity with Agentic Systems: Hands-on experience with
  LLM agents including:
  
  - LLM API use (e.g. LangChain/LangGraph, vLLM,
    OpenAI/Gemini/Anthropic APIs)
  - Agent Design: tool use (e.g. via MCP), retrieval, memory,
    grounding/attribution for claims, and guardrails.
  - Architectural patterns: planning and hand-off for multi-
    agent systems, context management
  - RAG: vector/hybrid search (e.g. pgvector, turbopuffer,
    rerankers, etc.)
  
  ML Platform expertise: 5+ years building and shipping ML
  systems to production; experience in the following areas:
  
  - Backend Python and JS familiarity required;
    Typescript/Golang familiarity welcome
  - Web services (e.g. Express/FastAPI, REST, SSE, JWTs)
  - Cloud Infrastructure (e.g. AWS, Terraform, VPC, Networking)
  - Backend databases/stores (e.g. Postgres, Redis)
  - Observability (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry,
    LangSmith/Langfuse)
  - [Preferred] Durable execution (e.g. Temporal, Hatchet)
  - [Preferred] OLAP (e.g. ClickHouse, Bigquery)
  - [Preferred] ML Inference (e.g. PyTorch, TensorRT, NVIDIA
    Triton), ideally in multimodal domains (text/image/video)
  - [Preferred] Compute orchestration (e.g. Kubernetes, Prefect,
    Ray)
  
  Experience with LLM Evaluations at scale: You’ve built
  offline/online eval harnesses and are familiar with the
  methodologies and metrics to measure:
  
  - Search, retrieval, and recommendation performance
  - Safety & robustness (security, compliance, red-teaming,
    regression testing)
  - Cost, performance and latency trade-offs
  - [Preferred] Agentic task success, trajectory quality,
    preference learning (e.g. SFT, DPO, RLHF, LLM-as-judge)
  
  Feeling uneasy that you haven’t ticked every box? That’s
  okay; we’ve felt that way too. Studies have shown women and
  minorities are less likely to apply unless they meet all
  qualifications. We encourage you to break the status quo and
  apply to roles that would make you excited to come to work
  every day.
  
  90 Days at Flock
  
  We are a results-oriented culture and believe job
  descriptions are a thing of the past. We prescribe 90 day
  plans and believe that good days lead to good weeks, which
  lead to good months. This serves as a preview of the 90 day
  plan you will receive if you were to be hired in this role
  at Flock Safety.
  
  The First 30 Days
  
  - Immerse yourself in the current system design and
    agent/tooling landscape. Understand the core customer use
    cases and data flows.
  - Support the team by shipping a few quick wins (e.g.,
    refining tool APIs, prompt engineering, fixing bugs)
  - Stand up the foundational eval and observability scaffolding
    (datasets, metrics, KPIs, reporting)
  - Propose a technical architecture and implementation plan for
    an agent evaluation framework.
  
  The First 60 Days
  
  - Deliver the MVP evaluation harness to produce initial
    metrics, enable debugging and perform regression testing.
  - Take on a system feature that offers demonstrated
    improvement against your MVP evaluation suite
  
  90 Days & Beyond
  
  - Productionize the evaluation and observability platform and
    make it the source of truth for quality and safety. (e.g.
    Online/offline tracing, alerting, dashboards, evaluations
    and PR-gated regression suite)
  - Own the roadmap for evolving the agent evaluation platform
  - Lead deeper R&D threads (e.g., lightweight fine-tuned
    projection layers, specialized embeddings, multimodal
    understanding) that can improve system performance on core
    metrics.
  
  If you’re excited to build AI that tangibly amplifies real-
  world public safety outcomes—and you love making complex
  systems measurable, dependable, and fast—we’d love to talk.
