  **Department:** Product & Engineering
  
  **Reports to:** VP of Engineering
  
  **About Gesture  **
  
  Gesture is where technology meets humanity — a place where innovation, emotion, and impact collide.  We’re a fast-growing tech company using AI, machine learning, and intelligent logistics to power a first-of-its-kind platform that connects people and brands through real-world, tangible experiences. From our mobile app to our B2B Reach360 platform, Gesture blends data, emotion, and automation to build the future of human connection — at scale.  
  
  Inside our NYC headquarters, you’ll find an environment that moves with the pace and precision of Silicon Valley but with the heart of something far greater. 
  
  We run on cutting-edge tools, creative experimentation, and raw ambition. Every project, every campaign, every moment you work on here matters — because it’s seen, felt, and experienced by real people around the world.  At Gesture, you’ll work alongside some of the smartest, most driven operators, engineers, and creatives in the industry — people who think big, move fast, and care deeply about the work they do. 
  
  This is a front-row seat to the future of connection.  If you want to help build something that’s changing how the world interacts, welcome to Gesture.
  
  **Where We’re Headed**
  Gesture is investing aggressively in AI-driven intelligence to power the next generation of marketing and commerce using a gift-centric approach. Our roadmap focuses on:
  We’re building intelligence that anticipates, adapts, and compounds—predicting intent, optimizing campaigns in real time, and delivering deeply personalized experiences driven by real-world behavior, all through systems that continuously learn and improve with every interaction.
  This is not surface-level automation. We’re building intelligence directly into the core of how campaigns are planned, executed, and measured—at scale.
  At Gesture, you’re not joining a static MarTech company. You’re joining a team building the infrastructure for how brands will compete in a post-digital-fatigue world.
  
  **About the Role**
  
  We’re now seeking a **Full Stack + AI Engineer** to help us launch the next phase of our app ecosystem: REAL.AI personalization, gesture-based loyalty experiences, and advanced in-app features that merge consumer data, behavioral prediction, and emotional intelligence.

  - **Lead the technical implementation** of **REAL.AI**, Gesture’s consumer intelligence engine - including data modeling, predictive algorithms, and personalized recommendation pipelines.
  
  - Architect and build **loyalty program infrastructure** that ties user behaviors (send frequency, engagement, referrals, redemption patterns) to tangible rewards and predictive engagement cycles.
  
  - Collaborate with the **mobile team (React Native)** to implement AI-driven personalization across feeds, notifications, and product recommendations.
  
  - Develop and integrate **API layers** between Firebase, Zoho CRM, Segment, Voucherify, and Gesture’s internal data warehouse (GCP).
  
  - Build scalable backend services that support dynamic campaigns, A/B tests, and loyalty redemptions.
