  Who We Are
  
  Yuno is a leader in payment orchestration, building the
  infrastructure that powers frictionless, global transactions
  for modern businesses. Our mission is to simplify and
  revolutionize how payments move — enabling merchants,
  consumers, and partners to operate with flexibility,
  intelligence, and trust. We’re entering a new chapter:
  infusing artificial intelligence across Yuno’s products and
  internal operations. We aim to design intelligent systems
  that create exponential efficiency, enhance user
  experiences, and unlock new sources of revenue.
  
  Shape your future with Yuno!
  
  We are seeking a Senior AI Engineer to architect, build, and
  scale AI-powered systems that redefine how Yuno operates and
  innovates. This role goes beyond building models — it’s
  about designing agentic systems, AI-assisted workflows, and
  data-driven decision engines that help the company scale
  faster than headcount. You will be at the forefront of
  developing the next generation of autonomous systems that
  power both customer-facing products and internal operations
  — from optimizing payment experiences to accelerating
  development, testing, troubleshooting, and product creation.
  
  🟣 How Yuno will challenge you
  
  AI Product Architecture & Development
  
  • Architect, build, and deploy LLM-powered applications that
  augment and automate key workflows across Yuno — from
  customer service and new product development to internal
  agentic workflows that optimize critical company processes.
  
  • Design autonomous AI systems that can execute technical
  analysis, testing, troubleshooting, and decision-making at
  scale.
  
  • Develop AI-driven tools that create measurable business
  impact — improving efficiency, accelerating innovation, and
  driving revenue growth.
  
  Operational Intelligence & Scalability
  
  • Identify areas across Yuno where AI can generate
  efficiency gains — reducing manual work, optimizing
  processes, and enabling smarter operations.
  
  • Build AI systems that enable Yuno to scale without
  exponential growth in headcount, thereby creating
  sustainable productivity and organizational intelligence.
  
  Data & Model Optimization
  
  • Lead fine-tuning and contextual optimization of AI models
  using Yuno’s proprietary data.
  
  • Continuously refine performance through structured
  feedback loops, observability metrics, and user interaction
  data.
  
  • Ensure adherence to privacy, compliance, and ethical AI
  principles in all model development.
  
  Cross-Functional Collaboration & Innovation
  
  • Work closely with data, product, and infrastructure teams
  to define the long-term AI roadmap for Yuno.
  
  • Experiment with emerging AI technologies to identify new
  capabilities that can drive differentiation and strategic
  advantage.
  
  • Contribute to a culture of experimentation, rapid
  iteration, and continuous learning across the AI function.
  
  🟣 The skills you need
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  • 5+ years of professional experience in AI/ML development,
  with at least 2 years focused on LLMs, RAG, or agentic
  systems.
  
  • Strong engineering and product mindset — capable of
  balancing technical depth with strategic impact.
  
  • Exceptional communication and collaboration skills to work
  across product, engineering, and data functions.
  
  • Passion for pushing the boundaries of applied AI and
  creating systems that drive real business transformation.
  
  Minimum Qualifications
  
  • LLMs & RAG: Proven experience designing and deploying
  systems using models like GPT, Claude, Gemini, or similar —
  including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines and
  contextual retrieval systems.
  
  • AI Agents & Multi-Agent Systems: Hands-on experience with
  Crew.ai, LangChain, LangGraph, or similar frameworks to
  build orchestrated agentic workflows.
  
  • Fine-Tuning & Context Engineering: Expertise in supervised
  fine-tuning (SFT), LoRA, or custom dataset adaptation for
  domain-specific tasks.
  
  • Programming & Frameworks: Proficiency in Python, GO and
  AI/ML libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX.
  
  • AI Infrastructure: Experience designing scalable,
  production-ready AI systems in AWS, GCP, or Azure, with a
  deep understanding of vector databases, model serving, and
  inference optimization.
  
  • Observability & Monitoring: Familiarity with LangSmith,
  LangFuse, or equivalent tools for tracking, debugging, and
  evaluating LLM performance.
  
  • API Integration: Expertise in integrating AI systems with
  RESTful APIs and internal platforms to create seamless,
  usable products.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  • Experience using LlamaIndex, Hugging Face, or similar
  open-source frameworks.
  
  • Strong understanding of context optimization, embedding
  strategies, and knowledge retrieval.
  
  • Familiarity with MLOps, CI/CD pipelines, and production
  deployment best practices.
  
  • Prior experience in fintech, payments, or other data-
  intensive and regulated industries.
  
  • Analytical rigor and ability to translate business
  objectives into measurable AI outcomes.
