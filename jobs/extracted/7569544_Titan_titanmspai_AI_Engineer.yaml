  About Titan:
  
  Titan is an AI holding company transforming IT services with
  its Augmented AI platform. We acquire and partner with the
  best Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and embed AI at the
  core of their operations, empowering technicians to work
  faster, smarter, and more strategically. Our augmented AI
  platform enables MSPs to scale like technology companies
  while delivering faster resolutions, better uptime, and more
  proactive, personalized support for their customers.
  
  In under a year, we’ve raised over $70M from General

  deployed agents seeing real-world impact to productivity.
  Our team bring together AI product expertise from Scale AI,
  Google, MIT, and Stanford with private equity experience
  from H.I.G. Capital and seasoned MSP executives who have led
  some of the industry’s top providers. Joining Titan means
  helping to redefine how work is done in IT Services and
  building a $100B company.
  
  About The Role:
  
  As an AI Engineer at Titan, you’ll play a pivotal role in
  shaping the future of AI-powered IT service delivery. You’ll
  work across the stack to build intuitive, high-impact
  products that blend human expertise with autonomous AI
  agents, transforming how managed service providers (MSPs)
  operate. This is an opportunity to join an early-stage team,
  have meaningful product ownership, and help define the
  engineering culture as we scale.
  
  What You Will Do:
  
  - Design, build, and optimize AI models that enhance
    automation and decision-making for IT operations.

    centric experiences that empower technicians and enhance
    service delivery.
  - Research and experiment with cutting-edge AI techniques to
    improve model accuracy and performance.
  - Collaborate with AI and backend engineers to integrate our

  Who You Are:
  
  - 4+ years of experience in AI/ML engineering, with hands-on
    experience in training, deploying, and optimizing models.
  - Comfortable working with large datasets and deploying models
    in production environments.
  - Startup mindset—comfortable with ambiguity, eager to take
    ownership, and ship quickly.
  - Experience working closely with designers and product
    managers to bring ideas to life.
  - Bonus: Experience with LLMs, fine-tuning, prompting, model
    distillation, or AI agents is a plus.
