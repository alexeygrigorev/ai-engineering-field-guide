  **Cytora**, now part of **Applied Systems**, combines cutting-edge innovation with global scale to transform commercial insurance.
  
  Founded in 2012, Cytora enables insurers digitise risks, unlock the value of external data, and automate risk intake across SME, Mid Market, and Specialty lines whereas Applied Systems are a global leader in insurance technology since 1983, powering more than 18,000 agencies and 160,000+ users across North America and Europe with its cloud-based software solutions.
  
  Together, Cytora and Applied Systems are accelerating digital transformation across the insurance industry—driving greater efficiency, data-driven insights, and connectivity between insurers and brokers worldwide.
  
  **The Role**
  
  As an AI Engineer (LLM), you will play a critical role in developing our core Large Language Model (LLM) service. 
  
  Our LLM service underpins our Generative AI powered risk digitization platform, providing a unified interface for internal services to leverage the power of LLMs at scale, regardless of the underlying foundational model. 
  
  You will be responsible for building, deploying, and optimizing LLM-powered solutions that directly impact our customer's ability to understand and process risk in commercial insurance.
  
  **What you will be doing**
  
  - 
  
  **Problem Solving & Collaboration:**
  
  Engage deeply with domain experts and product managers to understand and define key business problems within risk processing in commercial insurance that can be solved with LLMs.
  
  - 
  
  Collaborate closely with consuming service teams to define clear, efficient, and scalable interfaces for LLM tasks.
  
  - 
  
  **Development & Deployment:**
  
  Design, develop, test, and deploy domain-specific LLM tasks (e.g., information extraction, risk assessment, document summarization, etc.) that are readily consumable by other Cytora services.
  
  - 
  
  Stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in LLM technology and actively explore new models, techniques, and tools to enhance our capabilities e.g. Agentic AI.
  
  - 
  
  **Evaluation & Optimization:**
  
  Develop and implement comprehensive evaluation metrics and tools to rigorously assess and iterate on the performance of LLM tasks.
  
  - 
  
  Analyze task performance, identify areas for improvement, and implement strategies to optimize accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
  
  - 
  
  **Production & Monitoring:**
  
  Monitor the performance of deployed LLM tasks in production, proactively identify and address issues, and ensure high reliability and accuracy.
  
  **A successful candidate will likely have:**
  
  - 
  
  **Problem-Solving**: Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to address complex AI challenges.
