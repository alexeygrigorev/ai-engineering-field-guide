  💡 Role Description
  
  As one of our first AI/ML hires, you'll have the unique
  opportunity to:
  
  - Work on groundbreaking projects involving a mix of LLMs and
    traditional ML
  - Come up with novel research synthesis ideas using NLP

    growth
  - Contribute to product decisions, direction and
    prioritization
  - Shape our engineering culture

  to improve on and build.
  
  🔧 Sample set of projects
  
  - Build a search ranking algorithm across open text,
    integrating signals from user interactions (e.g., edits,
    copies, and engagement metrics) alongside semantic and
    PostgreSQL-based text search to improve relevance and
    ranking across multiple features.
  - Build your coworker: build an in-house prompt system that
    can use production signals or human labels to constantly
    and iteratively refine and improve prompts and output
  - Build and open source a benchmark for evaluating LLM output
    on investment research specific tasks
  - Build an agentic entity deduping system that uses signals
    from within the app and valuable external data sources /
    google to clean up the last mile of great STT output:
    entity resolution
  - Build a knowledge graph custom to every research sprint that
    begins as highly unstructured interview data and leverages
    agentic infrastructure to pull in data where necessary and
    constantly rebalance the graph and the derived output.
