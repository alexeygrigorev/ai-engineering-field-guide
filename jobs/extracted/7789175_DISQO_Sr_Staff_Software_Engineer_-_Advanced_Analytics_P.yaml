  About the Role:
  
  At DISQO, we’re redefining how companies turn data into
  decisions. Our mission is to make advertising and consumer
  behavior transparent, measurable, and actionable. We’re now
  building the next evolution of analytics - an agentic, AI-
  powered system that lets users explore complex data
  intuitively and instantly.
  
  This is a highly strategic and visible initiative at the
  heart of DISQO’s future. You’ll work directly with our CTO
  and a team of talented, driven engineers to architect and
  build a next-generation AI analytics engine from the ground
  up - leveraging Agentic AI to shape the foundation for how
  data intelligence is delivered to customers worldwide.
  
  What you will do:
  
  - Architect and deliver a high-performance Advanced Analytics
    Engine – featuring vectorized query processing, columnar
    storage and OLAP capabilities – that redefines speed,
    scalability, and analytical depth while crunching
    marketing datasets with sub-second performance.
  - Design and build an Agentic AI system that leverages this
    Advanced Analytics Engine to drive autonomous, intelligent
    decision-making.
  - Partner with product, engineering and data teams to power
    agentic AI analytics systems that autonomously explore
    data and surface actionable insights.
  - Profile, benchmark, and optimize Rust components for maximum
    throughput, low latency, and hardware-aware efficiency.
  - Leverage AWS cloud services to architect scalable, reliable,
    and cost-efficient analytics infrastructure.
  - Shape the evolution of DISQO’s broader data platform and its
    integration across our product ecosystem, leading
    architectural strategy and technical direction in close
    partnership with data and product engineering teams..
  - Mentor and guide engineers, fostering a culture of technical
    excellence, innovation, and collaboration.
  - Contribute to open-source or internal frameworks that
    advance analytical systems and distributed computation.
  
  What you bring to the role:
  
  - 12+ years of professional software engineering experience,
    including 5+ years architecting or building high-
    performance data systems or analytics platforms. 3+ years
    of product Rust experience.
  - Deep expertise in Rust and strong experience in Java.
    Ideally looking for individuals who have transitioned from
    Java to Rust.
  - Proven track record building large-scale data analytics or
    OLAP systems from the ground up.
  - Deep understanding of columnar data engines, vectorized
    execution, and query/dataframe optimization.
  - Hands-on experience with performance engineering, profiling,
    and hardware-aware optimization.
  - Strong expertise with AWS -  designing, deploying, and
    optimizing large-scale data and compute systems in the
    cloud.
  - A systems-thinking mindset - you see software, data, and
    infrastructure as one cohesive system to tune and
    optimize.
  - Thrives in a fast-moving, startup environment - comfortable
    balancing hands-on execution with big-picture
    architectural thinking.
  - Strong foundation in statistics and data analysis concepts.
  - Familiarity with AI-driven analytics, or experience with
    open-source engines such as Apache DataFusion, DuckDB or
    ClickHouse/chDB are big pluses.
  - Experience evolving / refactoring large brownfield solutions
    is a plus.
