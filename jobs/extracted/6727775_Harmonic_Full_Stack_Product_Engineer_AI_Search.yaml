  About us
  
  Harmonic is the startup discovery engine.
  
  It pains us to see great startup opportunities consistently
  go undiscovered. So, we dedicated ourselves to mapping out
  the startup landscape and building the tools that ensure the
  most promising founders get found and funded.
  
  The world's largest and most prolific venture capital firms
  (as well as the up-and-comers you haven’t heard of yet) rely
  on us to find and invest in the next Google, AirBnB, Uber,
  Stripe, and Anduril. We play a crucial part in ensuring
  hundreds of billions of dollars get routed efficiently and
  that the innovations the world would most benefit from
  materialize.
  
  We’re growing revenue at a rate of 100%+ annually and
  already power thousands of investors' workflow. Backed by
  $30M from investors like Craft, Floodgate, and Sozo
  Ventures, we want to power the entire investment workflow
  from discovery to term sheet. If you resonate with our
  values and want to fundamentally evolve how venture capital
  markets work, come join us.
  
  About Discovery & Scout
  
  The Discovery & Scout (Search) team sits at the core of
  Harmonic’s product and data engine. We make it possible to
  search, research, analyze, compare, and evaluate across the
  entire universe of startups (we track tens of millions of
  companies, hundreds of millions of operators and, tens of
  thousands of investors along with their deal activity, and
  counting). We source and ingest data from first-, second-
  and third-party sources, including hundreds of fragmented
  and unstructured sources, and turn them into structured
  insights and searchable indices. Recently, we built the
  industry leading agentic layer for startup search and
  research, that’s unlocking new paradigms for VCs to make
  sense of this vast amount of data on startups and automate
  critical tasks in their sourcing and diligence workflows.
  
  We’re in the middle of a massive platform shift where AI and
  LLMs are transforming what "software" is. Agentic product-
  and user-experience patterns will be spelled out in
  playbooks before long – and we’re building those playbooks,
  not waiting for them. This includes conversational
  interfaces, deep research, dynamic agentic frameworks
  purpose built for venture, and AI-first product workflows.
  We’re looking for folks that want to help redefine software
  and push on this frontier with deep curiosity, an insatiable
  growth mindset, and high agency.

  The role
  
  Scope of the role:
  
  - Build AI-fueled products for VC: We have a tight-knit, fast-
    paced team working across the stack on the cutting edge of
    AI frameworks, LLM models, and the next-gen of AI-first
    product experiences.
    - You’ll build and ship end-to-end AI capabilities – from core
      features in our LangGraph backend, to critical user
      journeys in the frontend React UI.
  - Agentic experimentation & evaluation: The industry is
    rapidly evolving, and new models and frameworks emerge
    weekly. We’ve built systems and evaluation frameworks that
    enable us to quickly determine whether new models perform
    better in pockets of the product, and are relentless about
    experimenting with new frameworks that emerge if we see a
    not-before-possible use case it can service.
    - You’ll be hands on rapidly prototyping, benchmarking, and
      tuning usage of LLM models and agentic architectures.
      Establishing and building new evaluation frameworks, and
      partnering with human (+ LLM) evaluators to constantly
      improve user outcomes for AI-driven experiences.
  - Shape AI-native experiences: We’re in the very early innings
    of an HCI evolution, and are part of shaping AI-native
    design principles and patterns. We’re stoked to be at the
    forefront, proving out new functional patterns.
    - You will collaborate with product, design, data, and go-to-
      market teams to design and build AI-first product
      experiences that make investors 10x more productive.
  
  Background we’re looking for:
  
  - 3–5 years of software engineering experience, with
    substantial exposure to full-stack development in Python
    and React
  - A love for keeping up with the latest AI/LLM models, new
    frameworks, and experimenting with AI-native tools
  - Strong problem-solving skills and a track record of driving
    product development initiatives in fast-paced environments
  - Top-tier product taste, unrelenting curiosity, and customer-
    obsession
