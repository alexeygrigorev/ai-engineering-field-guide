  About Traversal
  
  Traversal is the AI Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) for the
  enterprise—already trusted by some of the largest companies
  in the world to troubleshoot, remediate, and even prevent
  the most complex production incidents. Our mission is to
  free engineers from endless firefighting and enable them to
  focus on creative, high-impact work.
  
  Our roots remain deeply embedded in AI research, and we’re
  channeling that scientific rigor and creativity into
  building the premier AI agent lab for the enterprise. Hence,
  what we’re proudest of is assembling the most talented yet
  nicest group of individuals, including researchers from MIT,
  Harvard, and Berkeley, to world-class engineers from
  industry: Citadel Securities, Cockroach Labs, Datadog, DE
  Shaw, ServiceNow, Glean, Perplexity, Pinecone, and more, to
  take on one of the hardest problems for AI to solve. Without
  the entire team, none of this would be possible.
  
  The Role
  
  Site Reliability Engineering and troubleshooting are at the
  core of what Traversal does, and while that’s simple to say,
  it’s hard to do, and even harder to explain. SREs analyze
  customer issues, but SRE Researchers figure out how they
  analyze customer issues then work with engineering to teach
  the AI to replicate their process. In addition, our target
  user base is experienced SREs (like you) so be prepared to
  put yourself in the mindset of end users and help shape the
  product directly. To sum up, Traversal wants to model your
  troubleshooting talent in code, putting you at the nexus of
  current customers, potential customers, developers, AI
  engineers, UI experts and more.
  
  We’re entering a phase of rapid growth driven by the needs
  of customers from mid-market to Fortune100 enterprises. We
  need people with an engineering mindset who enjoy solving
  puzzles and have the flexibility to do something different
  every day. You’ll play a key role in establishing the SRE
  research practices that allow us to exceed customer
  expectations today, tomorrow and beyond.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Troubleshooting Disparate Systems: Our customers use a wide
    variety of platforms so flexibility and curiosity are
    critical
  - External Interface: Gather requirements from new customers,
    guide them through on-boarding and maintain positive
    relationships to ensure their success
  - Internal Collaboration: Partner with engineering, AI, and
    product teams, passing along what you learn from end-
    users, as well as your own input
  - Evaluation and Analysis: Using your troubleshooting and
    customer RCAs to evaluate Traversal’s performance and find
    ways to further improve it
  - Incident Management: Lead and further our internal on-call
    and incident response processes, including alerting,
    debugging, and postmortems
  
  Requirements
  
  - 5+ years of experience as an SRE, infrastructure engineer,
    or similar role in fast-paced environments
  - Innate ability to debug distributed systems (e.g.: bare
    metal, VMs, Kubernetes, Docker, containers), understand
    how you did it and explain it to others
  - Expertise with observability and metrics tools (Datadog,
    Elasticsearch, Grafana, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus,
    ServiceNow, Splunk, etc) and incident response
  - Understanding of networking including routers, switches,
    firewalls, VPNs, etc
  - Hands-on experience with cloud environments (AWS, Azure,
    Digital Ocean, GCP) and Infrastructure As Code like Helm
    and Terraform
  - Experience supporting cloud/on-prem and hybrid deployments
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Background in developer productivity tooling or internal
    platform teams
  - Prior experience building systems that connect infra events
    to developer workflows
  - Exposure to agentic systems or AI observability platforms

  We offer competitive compensation, startup equity, health
  insurance, and additional benefits. The U.S. base salary
  range for this full-time, in-person role in New York is
