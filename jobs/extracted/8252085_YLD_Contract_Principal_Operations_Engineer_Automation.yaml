  About YLD:
  
  Our goal is to help our clients keep moving forward. We work
  with them to build the skills and capabilities they need to
  stay ahead of the competition, and we know our success only
  happens when they succeed. We’re a team of curious, talented
  people, and we’re committed to making YLD a place where
  great people want to work, grow, and stay.
  
  We’re a remote-first consultancy specialising in software
  engineering, product design, and data. Our teams are based
  across London, Lisbon, and Porto, and we create digital
  solutions that continue to deliver value long after our work
  is done.
  
  About the role:
  
  As a Principal Operations Engineer at YLD, you will help
  remove friction from how YLD operates.
  
  This role will start as a senior consulting engagement. The
  intent is to move quickly, deliver tangible improvements,
  and learn what the long-term shape of this capability should
  be. Based on outcomes and mutual fit, there may be an
  opportunity to transition into a permanent role, but this is
  not assumed upfront.
  
  This is a senior, hands-on role for someone who can move
  comfortably between business problems and technical
  solutions. You will work across People, Finance,
  Engineering, Product Design, Client Services, and
  Commercial, identifying where work is slow, manual, or
  overly complex and fixing it.
  
  This is not a coordination or advisory role. You will be
  expected to design, build, automate, and ship improvements
  yourself, using code, automation, and AI as first-class
  tools.
  
  The role reports to the COO and works closely with the
  leadership team. Regular travel to Portugal is expected to
  stay close to teams and how work actually happens.
  
   Your day-to-day responsibilities will look like
  this:Eliminate operational friction
  
  - Identify high-leverage operational pain points across the
    business
  - Remove unnecessary steps, manual work, and duplicated effort
  - Replace fragile processes with simple, resilient systems
  - Focus on outcomes, not documentation for its own sake
  
  Build and automate internal systems
  
  - Design and build internal tools, workflows, and automations
  - Integrate and extend existing platforms (HRIS, finance
    systems, CRM, access management, internal tooling),
    working closely with external partners where needed to
    ensure systems fit together cleanly and workflows work
    end-to-end
  - Use scripting, APIs, low-code, and AI where they
    meaningfully improve speed and consistency
  - Treat internal operations as a product, with users, feedback
    loops, and iteration
  
  Apply AI pragmatically
  
  - Identify where AI can remove cognitive or manual load
  - Implement AI-assisted workflows that teams actually adopt
  - Balance speed with safety, judgement, and data
    responsibility
  - Focus on practical leverage rather than experimentation
    theatre
  
  Work closely with teams and leadership
  
  - Work directly with Client Partners, People, Finance, Heads
    of, and the leadership team
  - Understand how work happens in practice and where
    constraints show up
  - Deliver improvements in small, practical increments
  - Reduce reliance on ad-hoc escalation and manual coordination
  
  Create sustainable foundations
  
  - Ensure improvements are understandable, maintainable, and
    clearly owned
  - Document systems and processes where it materially reduces
    risk, improves continuity, or supports scale
  - Help define what longer-term operational capability should
    look like as YLD continues to scale
  
  You’ll have the following skills and experience:
  
  - Strong engineering background (software, platform,
    automation, or systems engineering)
  - Proven experience applying technical solutions to business
    or operational problems
  - Comfort working across non-technical teams such as People,
    Finance, and Commercial
  - High judgement and the confidence to make trade-offs
  - Experience using automation and AI in real workflows, not
    just demos
  
  This role is for you if:
  
  - You are an engineer who enjoys solving business and
    operational problems
  - You like working end-to-end, from messy problem to shipped
    solution
  - You are comfortable operating with ambiguity and imperfect
    information
  - You focus on simplifying how work gets done by removing
    unnecessary steps and manual effort.
  - You think in systems but stay close to how people actually
    work
  - You see AI and automation as leverage, not magic
  - You get satisfaction from making other people’s work easier
    and faster
  
  This role is not for you if:
  
  - You want a strategy or advisory-only role
  - You prefer writing recommendations over building solutions
  - You are uncomfortable touching real systems or tooling
  - You expect fully defined requirements before starting
  - You want to manage a large team rather than ship yourself
  - You are most comfortable working in heavily governed,
    committee-driven environments
  
  What success looks like in the first months:
  
  - High-friction operational workflows have been simplified or
    removed
  - Manual work has been replaced with automation where it makes
    sense
  - Teams report clearer ownership and less operational drag
  - Leadership time spent on day-to-day operational problem-
    solving is visibly reduced
  - Internal systems feel easier, faster, and more predictable
    to use, with clear ownership and lightweight documentation
    where it matters
  
  
  
  Our typical Recruitment Process looks like this:
  
  - 1st Interview with someone from the Talent team (30/45 mins)
  - 2nd Interview with two of our Engineers (~1h30)
  - 3rd Panel Interview with our COO, Head of Client Services
    and Head of People (1h30)
  
  We live and breathe our values, and know you will too:
  
  - Growing every day
  - Including everyone
  - Relationships built on honesty and ethics
  - Inspiring solutions
  - Winning together
  
  We’re an equal-opportunity employer and value diversity in
  all its forms. We do not discriminate based on race,
  religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual
  orientation, pregnancy or maternity, age, marital status, or
  disability. We also offer a remote-first working
  environment, with flexible working and work–life balance as
  standard for all employees.
