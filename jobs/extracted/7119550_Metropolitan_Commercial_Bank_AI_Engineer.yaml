  **Position Summary:**
  
  Metropolitan Commercial Bank (the “Bank”) is seeking a VP-level AI/ML Engineer to deploy AI solutions at enterprise scale, with a strong emphasis on Large Language Model (LLM) applications and modern MLOps & AIOps practices. This role sits at the intersection of data science and software engineering, reporting to the manager of the IT Application Development and Support team and working closely with the Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer, transforming innovative AI prototypes into robust, scalable production systems. The AI/ML Engineer will lead the deployment of high-impact AI capabilities (e.g., generative AI systems, personalization engines, automation tools) and ensure scalable AI platforms that deliver real-world value. The role also includes designing, constructing, and maintaining the Bank’s AIOps solution, with Snowflake as the primary ML platform (e.g., Snowpark Python, UDFs/UDTFs, Tasks/Streams, and Snowflake-native ML).
  
  *We have a flexible work schedule where employees can work from home one day a week.*
  
  **Essential duties and responsibilities:**
  
  ** Production Architecture & AIOps:**
  
  - Establish and enforce architecture standards for production AI systems, including data pipelines, model serving infrastructure, and real-time inference services.
  
  - Implement AIOps/MLOps pipelines for CI/CD of ML models, model governance, monitoring, and lifecycle management.
  
  - Design and maintain scalable software applications with integrated AI/ML capabilities.
  
  - Develop software architecture and design patterns to ensure performance and scalability.
  
  - Write clean, maintainable code in general-purpose programming languages (Python, Java, C, C++, Go).
  
  - Implement and manage data pipelines for preprocessing and transforming data for AI/ML models.
  
  - Integrate AI/ML models into production environments and optimize for reliability and scalability.
  
  - Apply Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles and implement monitoring and alerting solutions.
  
  - Conduct code reviews and provide technical guidance to junior developers.
  
  - Stay current with advancements in software engineering and AI/ML technologies.
  
  - Adhere to agile and lean software development best practices.
  
  - Thoroughly document all developed models and processes according to relevant policies and standards.
  
  - Support the production environment by either resolving technical or functional issues, in line with the procedures defined by the Bank.
  
  **Cross-Functional Collaboration:**
  
  - Partner with data scientists, AI scientists, product managers, data engineers, DevOps, and business stakeholders to operationalize AI algorithms.
  
  - Mentor or train teams and coordinate between research-oriented AI scientists and engineering teams to continuously improve models with production feedback.
  
  **Scaling & Performance:**
  
  - Ensure AI solutions perform at scale, handling thousands of daily inferences with low latency and high reliability.
  
  - Optimize model serving using techniques like model compression, caching, and hardware acceleration.
  
  - Implement robust monitoring and alerting for model performance to detect and address degradation (e.g., drift, latency issues).
