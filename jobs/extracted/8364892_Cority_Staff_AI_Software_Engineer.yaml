  Cority is looking for a Staff AI Software Engineer to be a
  part of our existing team. Our organization is a dynamic,
  fast-paced, highly collaborative environment. We are looking
  for a passionate team player who is committed to the success
  of the collective group. The successful candidate will be
  able to leverage their excellent technical capabilities and
  drive while delivering immediate value and influencing our
  long-term roadmap. This is a fantastic opportunity to join a
  highly skilled and dynamic team. We take the success of our
  customers incredibly seriously and our team is a critical
  part of this success.
  
  Reporting to the Development Manager, the Staff AI Software
  Engineer is primarily responsible for designing and
  enhancing base Cority software, as well as working with
  Product Development to develop software to meet client
  needs. We are looking for an experienced AI Engineer who
  specializes in building agents and agentic systems from
  task-orchestration agents to workflow automation agents,
  retrieval-augmented agents, research/coding agents,
  multimodal agents, and domain-specific autonomous agents.
  This is a full-stack AI engineering role, ideal for someone
  who loves shipping: rapid MVPs → stable production, high
  ownership, and fast problem-solving. Candidates must have
  built and deployed at least two AI agents in production in
  the past 12 months
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Design, build, and ship agentic workflows across multiple
    domains (research agents, coding assistants,
    conversational agents (voice, texts, etc), reasoning
    agents, scheduling agents, analytics agents, workflow
    automation bots, etc.).
  - Own the end-to-end lifecycle: data ingestion → reasoning →
    action taking → evaluation → monitoring.
  - Build multi-step agents capable of autonomous planning,
    context tracking, memory, tool use, and API orchestration.
  - Architect systems using modern agent stacks (LangChain,
    LlamaIndex, OpenAI Assistants, Model Context Protocol
    (MCP), custom orchestration).
  - Build robust retrieval pipelines (RAG), vector embeddings,
    caching layers, and knowledge grounding systems.
  - Deploy agents as microservices with proper observability,
    evals, guardrails and fallbacks.
  - Optimize inference cost, latency, accuracy, and task-
    completion rates.
  - Run systematic evaluations: function calling accuracy,
    groundedness, hallucinations, long context stability.
  - Create reusable frameworks and libraries to accelerate
    subsequent agent builds.
  - Comfortable building MVPs in days and scaling them to stable
    production within weeks/months
  - Drive technical and architectural decisions to meet product
    requirements while also anticipating and designing for
    future needs
  - Design and develop new software and enhance existing
    software for clients’ systems, and for Cority’s base
    software.
  - Communicate directly with Product Owners to ensure that
    requirements and specifications are understood.
  - Develop high-quality software and is an advocate of
    automation frameworks for testing, integration, and
    deployment.
  - Review completed software designs or prototypes with team
    and participates in code reviews
  - Mentor junior developers.
  - Open to learning and working with modern technologies as
    required in the project.

  - Experience with Retrieval (RAG), embeddings, vector DBs
    (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, PGVector)
  - Experience with MCP servers or integrating MCP tools.
  - Experience with structured function-calling workflows (JSON
    schema, tool plans, agent graphs)
  - Experience with .NET Core, Node, Python, .Net Framework,
    Entity Framework/Dapper, Web APIs and Microservices.
  - Experience developing of database applications using
    relational database systems such as Postgres, SQL Server.
