  **POSITION SUMMARY:**
  
  This position is responsible for helping to expand our capabilities in the intersection of traditional software development and artificial intelligence, focusing on building reliable systems that leverage state of the art language models and related technologies effectively. Also responsible for designing and implementing sophisticated retrieval systems, fine-tune models, develop robust prompting strategies, and create efficient smaller models for on premise deployment.
  
  **DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES**
  
  - Design and implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems with both semantic and traditional search capabilities.
  
  - Develop and optimize vector search systems for effective information retrieval.
  
  - Create data preparation pipelines for model fine-tuning.
  
  - Execute and evaluate model fine-tuning experiments.
  
  - Design and test prompt engineering strategies and in-context learning approaches.
  
  - Build fault-tolerant applications integrating with AWS Bedrock and SageMaker.
  
  - Implement production-grade Python backends for AI-powered features.
  
  - Develop evaluation frameworks for RAG and fine-tuning performance.
  
  - Design and implement knowledge distillation pipelines for smaller, deployable models.
  
  - Optimize models for on-premise deployment in data center environments.
  
  - Engineer reasoning capabilities in smaller self-hosted models.
  
  - Evaluate trade-offs between model size, performance, and reasoning capabilities.
  
  - Manage model deployment and monitoring in on-premise environments.
  
  **EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS**
  
  - • Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or related field is required with a minimum of three years of relevant experience.
