  Headway’s mission is a big one – to build a new mental health care system everyone can access. We’ve built technology that helps people find great therapists with the first software-enabled national network of providers accepting insurance. 
  
  1 in 4 people in the US have a treatable mental health condition, but the majority of providers don’t accept insurance, making therapy too expensive for most people. Headway is building a new mental healthcare system that everyone can access by making it easy for therapists to accept insurance and scale their practice. 
  
  Headway was founded in 2019. Since then, we’ve grown into a diverse, national network of over 60,000 mental healthcare providers across all 50 states who run their practice on our software and have served over 1 million patients. We’re a Series D company with over $325m in funding from a16z (Andreessen Horowitz), Accel, GV (formerly Google Ventures), Spark Capital, Thrive Capital, Forerunner Ventures and Health Care Service Corporation.
  
  We want your time here to be the most meaningful experience of your career. **Join us, and help change mental healthcare for the better.**
  ****About engineering at Headway****
  
  Building a new mental healthcare system at Headway is only possible because of the scale and leverage that software can provide.  The engineering team at Headway is a small but mighty team using technology to build that future (and have a fun time while doing it!).
  **Principles that guide us:**
  - **Focus on the mission**: We view software as a means of effecting change in the world, not as an end unto itself. We write software to empower our patients and therapists to better solve the problems they’re facing. 
  
  - **Ship small, learn fast**: We are building new and novel products and believe that we learn what our users need by quickly shipping and iteration
  
  - **Everything is a product**: Whether it's our patient search experience or a developer productivity improvement, we treat everything we build at Headway as a product with end-users in mind.
  
  - **Optimize for trust**: We believe that engineers should be continually learning. To learn effectively and to be productive, engineers must feel safe asking questions and discussing mistakes.
  **Tools we use:**
  - **Languages:** Python 3, TypeScript
  
  - **Libraries & Frameworks: **FastAPI, React, Remix, Next.js, React Aria
  
  - **Infrastructure: **AWS (Fargate, ECS, S3, and more), Spark and Kafka
  
  - **Monitoring:** Datadog, PagerDuty, Sentry
  
  - **Version Control:** Github, PagerDuty
  **About the role:**
  
  We are looking for a Staff AI Engineer to lead how we design, build, and operate AI powered systems within the patient experience. This role will help establish Headway’s approach to AI engineering by creating strong tooling, evaluation frameworks, and development practices. At the same time, it will directly own and deliver our earliest AI supported patient products, including AI assisted intake and AI supported therapy experiences.
  
  This is a hands on technical leadership role. You will write production code, design systems that multiple teams rely on, and partner closely with product, clinical, and data leaders to ensure that our AI systems are safe, effective, and aligned with patient outcomes.
  ****Who you are****
  
  We are looking for a Staff level engineer who thrives in ambiguity and is excited to learn new technologies and systems. You care about building high impact products, you think in systems, and you raise the bar for the people around you.
  
  - You shape technical work to achieve company and team goals, not just local optimizations.
  
  - You are willing to flex into new technical and non technical areas as projects require.
  
  - You have driven technical vision and strategy at the organizational level through technical design documents, reviews, and participation in planning cycles.
  
  - You have led major technical initiatives that required coordination across multiple teams and stakeholders.
  
  - You regularly mentor senior engineers and technical leaders and help set technical direction through influence rather than authority.
  
  - You have real world experience building AI powered features using LLMs or applied machine learning.
  
  - You have designed evaluation strategies for AI systems and understand the limits of automated metrics, especially in domains where correctness, safety, and tone matter.
  
  - You care deeply about reliability, privacy, and safety when deploying AI systems and you design with these constraints in mind from the start.
  
  - You are comfortable partnering with product managers, designers, clinicians, and legal or compliance partners to translate complex domain needs into responsible AI systems.
