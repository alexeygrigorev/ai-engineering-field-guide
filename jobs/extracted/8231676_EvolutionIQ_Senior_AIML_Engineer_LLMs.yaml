  About Us: EvolutionIQ’s mission is to deliver state of the
  art technology that helps insurance claims teams make claims
  handling more accurate, fair, and efficient, so that more
  people impacted by injury or illness can continue their
  lives with dignity and stability. We are currently
  experiencing massive growth and to accomplish our goals, we
  are hiring world-class talent who want to help build and

  team is our #1 priority, and we have been named one of
  Inc.’s Best Workplaces 3 years in a row and Built In’s Best
  Places to work in 2025 and 2026!
  
  The Adventure: We're the leading AI Guidance Platform in the
  insurance industry today, working with some of the largest
  insurance carriers in the US and expanding globally. We are
  growing incredibly fast and have a nearly 100% success
  record in converting pilots to production deployments. You
  will be designing on a shared, unified platform that can
  scale across multiple lines of business. Our engineering
  culture values simplicity, core engineering principles,
  quality, honesty, transparency and strong collaboration. If
  you’re excited to work on a fast-moving enterprise
  engineering team using the latest technologies at high
  scale, we want to meet you.
  
  About You: As an ambitious AI/LLM Engineer, you will play a
  key role in advancing our industry-leading medical synthesis
  product. You take strong ownership of your work and have a
  proven track record of driving projects end-to-end, from
  ideation through deployment. Thriving in a fast-paced
  startup environment, you stay current with the latest AI and
  machine learning research. You’re passionate about applying
  hybrid approaches that combine large language models (LLMs),
  statistical machine learning techniques, and retrieval-
  augmented generation (RAG) with embeddings-based models to
  deliver better, more reliable outcomes for our users. In
  this Role You Will:
  
  - Design, build, and deploy AI-powered and LLM-driven features
    for our claim synthesis product, including robust
    extraction of key information from complex medical
    documents and human-in-the-loop summarization workflows
  - Develop and implement hybrid machine learning solutions that
    leverage statistical models, LLMs, and embeddings-based
    retrieval techniques such as RAG to improve system
    accuracy, scalability, and robustness
  - Write clean, scalable, and efficient code while optimizing
    the performance of existing AI/ML systems in production
  - Collaborate closely with data labelers and subject matter
    experts (SMEs) to rigorously evaluate AI system outputs
    and continuously improve model performance
  - Partner with Product teams to rapidly iterate on feedback
    and deliver impactful features
  - Translate cutting-edge AI/ML research and novel techniques
    into production-grade, reliable, and maintainable
    solutions that operate seamlessly in live customer
    environments
  
  Skills Requirements:
  
  - 3+ years of experience writing performant Python code
    following modern best practices
  - Minimum 1 year of experience building and deploying products
    powered by large language models (LLMs) in fast-paced,
    professional environments
  - Hands-on experience with statistical machine learning
    techniques as well as hybrid approaches combining LLMs,
    retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and embeddings-based
    models, including vector search and similarity measures
  - Proven ability to build and integrate API services within
    service-oriented or microservice architectures
  - Strong skills in evaluating and interpreting LLM outputs and
    AI model predictions, with a focus on aligning model
    behavior with real-world business and user outcomes
  - Expertise in prompt engineering and fine-tuning of large
    language models for domain-specific applications
  
  Bonus Points:
  
  - Experience translating state-of-the-art AI/ML research into
    production code
  - Comfortable collaborating with data labelers and subject
    matter experts to improve training data and evaluation
    processes
  - Experience building agentic or autonomous AI systems in
    production
  - Background working with multimodal data (e.g., images,
    audio)
  
  Work-life, Culture & Perks:
  
  - Compensation: The base salary range is $185-235K, with
