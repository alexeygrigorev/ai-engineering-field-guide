  Who We Are
  
  Stylitics is the leading visual outfitting and styling
  solution for the world’s top retailers and brands. Our
  clients include Nike, Macy’s, Revolve, Puma, Crate & Barrel,
  Bloomingdale’s, and dozens of others. Founded in 2011,
  Stylitics uses a powerful combination of algorithms, trend
  data, and stylist expertise to deliver millions of on-brand
  outfit recommendations daily across multiple channels such
  as e-commerce, email, advertising, stores, and social media.
  About 100 million shoppers use Stylitics content and
  technology on retail sites each month to find inspiration,
  discover new products and brands, and gain confidence in how
  to style their purchases.
  
  The Role
  
  We're building the future of AI-powered fashion & retail
  automation, and we need a craftsperson who lives and
  breathes Clojure. This isn't just about managing pipelines
  or writing glue code, this is about shipping intelligent
  systems that matter.
  
  Here's what we're actually building: AI workflows that
  generate outfit images at scale. Systems that write product
  copy and attribution automatically. Intelligent review flows
  where humans and AI collaborate to produce millions of
  styled recommendations. Vector search architectures that
  power semantic discovery across our catalog. Temporal-
  orchestrated workflows that coordinate LLMs, image
  generation, data pipelines, and human review loops. All of
  it needs to be fast, reliable, and integrated into our
  existing platform serving 100M+ shoppers monthly.
  
  You'll work in Clojure and ClojureScript across the stack,
  but this is backend-heavy. You'll design data models in
  PostgreSQL, build Temporal workflows that orchestrate
  complex AI operations, integrate with Qdrant for vector
  search and RAG, and create ClojureScript interfaces for
  human audits. You'll own features end-to-end: from schema
  design to API implementation to the review UI that your
  colleagues use daily.
  
  We're a team of 12+ Clojure engineers who move fast and care
  about craft. We value ownership deeply. You'll have autonomy
  to architect solutions, make technical decisions, and ship
  production code quickly. If you're curious, opinionated
  about good code, and excited to build AI systems that
  actually work at scale, keep reading.
  
  What You'll Build
  
  - Temporal workflows that orchestrate multi-step AI
    operations: product attribution, copy generation, image
    generation, outfit creation.
  - Backend services in Clojure that integrate with LLM APIs
    (GPT, Gemini, etc.), manage context and prompts, handle
    streaming responses, and process structured outputs
  - Data models and PostgreSQL schemas that support complex AI
    workflows, vector embeddings, and integration with our
    existing product catalog
  - RAG pipelines using Qdrant for semantic search, similarity
    matching, and context retrieval that powers smarter AI
    recommendations
  - MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations and tool-calling
    architectures that let LLMs interact with our systems,
    query data, and trigger actions
  - ClojureScript UIs for review workflows where humans
    validate, edit, and improve AI-generated content
  - APIs and data pipelines that connect everything together,
    monitoring systems that track AI quality, and the
    infrastructure that lets us ship fast
  
  What You Bring
  
  - Strong Clojure and ClojureScript experience. You've built
    production systems, you understand functional programming
    deeply, and you're comfortable with the ecosystem (shadow-
    cljs, re-frame, reagent etc.)
  - Solid SQL skills and database design experience. You can
    model complex domains in PostgreSQL, write efficient
    queries, design schemas, and handle migrations. This is
    important.
  - Experience integrating LLMs into production systems. You
    understand prompt engineering, managing context windows,
    handling non-deterministic outputs, and the practical
    challenges of building reliable AI features
  - Backend engineering fundamentals. You know how to build
    APIs, design data flows, handle errors gracefully, and
    architect systems that scale
  - High velocity. You ship often. You balance speed with
    quality, you know when to refactor and when to iterate,
    and you don't let perfect be the enemy of good
  - Ownership mindset. You take responsibility for features from
    conception to production. You care about the outcome, not
    just writing code
  - Curiosity. You're interested in AI, workflow orchestration,
    vector search, frontend UIs, data modeling, and figuring
    out how all the pieces fit together
  
  Great to Have
  
  - Experience with Java and the JVM ecosystem
  - Experience with Temporal or similar workflow orchestration
    systems (Airflow, Dagster, Step Functions)
  - Familiarity with vector databases like Qdrant, Pinecone, or
    Weaviate, and RAG architectures
  - Experience with MCP (Model Context Protocol) or building
    tool-calling systems where LLMs interact with external
    services
  - Understanding of image generation models, multimodal AI, or
    working with vision APIs
  - Contributions to open-source Clojure projects
  - Background in other functional programming languages
    (Haskell, OCaml, Elixir, Scala)
  - Experience building developer tools, automation systems, or
    human-in-the-loop workflows
  
  Why Join Us
  
  - Modern stack: Clojure/ClojureScript, Temporal, PostgreSQL,
    Qdrant, LLM APIs, cloud infrastructure
  - Lots of greenfield opportunities. You'll build new systems
    while also integrating into our existing platform
  - Ownership and autonomy. You'll make architectural decisions,
    influence product direction, and see your work in
    production quickly
  - Team of 12+ Clojure engineers who value craft, velocity, and
    learning from each other
  - Flexible remote-first culture with optional NYC office
    collaboration
  - Be part of defining how AI transforms fashion and e-commerce
