  **About Salesforce**
  
  Salesforce is the #1 AI CRM, where humans with agents drive customer success together. Here, ambition meets action. Tech meets trust. And innovation isn’t a buzzword — it’s a way of life. The world of work as we know it is changing and we're looking for Trailblazers who are passionate about bettering business and the world through AI, driving innovation, and keeping Salesforce's core values at the heart of it all.
  
  Ready to level-up your career at the company leading workforce transformation in the agentic era? You’re in the right place! Agentforce is the future of AI, and you are the future of Salesforce.
  
  **About Slack****Slack is your Digital HQ – a place where work flows between your people, systems, partners, and customers. From Fortune 100 companies to corner markets, millions of people around the world use Slack to connect their teams, unify their systems, and drive their business forward.
  As a Staff engineer on this team, you'll have genuine autonomy: shaping the technical direction, making tradeoffs between performance and features, and deciding what gets built next based on user impact. You'll lead the Search and AI mobile efforts, owning the roadmap and technical strategy for two of our highest-impact user journeys—helping people find what they need and get things done on the go. This isn't about porting desktop features to mobile; it's about reimagining AI and Search for how people actually work from their phones, leveraging mobile-specific capabilities like notifications, location, and device sensors to build context-aware experiences that feel native. Mobile is a critical touchpoint for our users, and there's significant untapped potential to drive AI adoption on the platform. You'll mentor engineers equally passionate about mobile-first thinking while partnering closely with Product and Design.
  Candidates should have an eye for the alluring iOS design our users expect and an attention to detail down to the very last density independent pixel. They should know their way around the View hierarchy and be eager to partner with Product and Design to craft efficient, performant, and delightful user experiences. They’ll like building for the long term and value patterns and structures that allow for maximum flexibility in a constantly evolving product.
  What You Should Have:**
  
  - 
  
  At least 7+ years of mobile engineering experience with an emphasis on technical leadership in medium to large teams.
  
  - 
  
  Related technical degree required.
  
  - 
  
  A demonstrated track record of spotting issues in complex codebases and transforming them into successful, high-impact projects.
  
  - 
  
  An extensive understanding of iOS framework components and their respective lifecycles.
  
  - 
  
  Strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms and programming languages
  
  - 
  
  Experience working closely with product teams, designers, and other developers to create a truly delightful mobile experience
  
  - 
  
  Current and detailed knowledge of the capabilities of different iOS API levels
  
  - 
  
  Experience developing highly performant Swift/Objective-C code and view layouts and the ability to diagnose performance bottlenecks
  
  - 
  
  Familiarity with the iOS tool ecosystem for development, testing, debugging, and performance benchmarking.
  
  - 
  
  An excellent understanding of best practices for concurrency and threading
  
  **Bonus Points**
  
  - 
  
  Experience using Slack and a keen interest in making it better
  
  - 
  
  Experience with SwiftUI, Combine, or async/await
  
  - 
  
  Familiarity with iOS performance profiling tools (Instruments, Xcode profiler)
  
  - 
  
  A passion for building and maintaining great open source projects or otherwise contributing to the iOS community

  Salesforce is an equal opportunity employer and maintains a policy of non-discrimination with all employees and applicants for employment. What does that mean exactly?

The same goes for compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, reduction in workforce, recall, training, and education.
