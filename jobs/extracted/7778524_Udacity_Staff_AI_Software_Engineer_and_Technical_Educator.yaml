  **About Us**
  
  Udacity is now an Accenture company, and exciting things are happening! 🚀 We are on a mission of forging futures in tech through ***radical*** talent transformation in digital technologies. We offer a unique and immersive online learning platform, powering corporate technical training in fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Autonomous Systems, Cloud Computing and more. Our rapidly growing global organization is revolutionizing how the enterprise market bridges the talent shortage and skills gaps during their digital transformation journey.
  
  Udacity’s AI Content Engineering team is hiring an Agentic Software Engineer & Technical Educator to design and scale content agents and the backend systems that create agentic courses and interactive learning experiences. 
  
  In addition to building agents, you will appear on camera as the author for your courses, teaching concepts and walking through demos. The interview process will assess your potential for teaching on camera—no prior course-creation or on-camera experience is required. We will teach you on the job.
  
  **What You’ll Do: Engineering**
  
  - Design: Multi-agent architectures and orchestration patterns for content creation, review, and publishing.
  
  - Build: Production agents and tools, and their CLIs/APIs, in Python and Go to power content creation and interactive learning.
  
  - Orchestrate: Stateful agents, event-driven pipelines and tool/function calling.
  
  - Evaluate: Automated evals, rubrics, safety guardrails, and human-in-the-loop review with clear quality metrics.
  
  - Collaborate: Partner with learning designers to ship learner-first experiences.
  
  **What You’ll Do: Teaching & Content Creation**
  
  - Present On Camera: Be the face and voice of your courses, teaching complex technical concepts with clarity and enthusiasm
  
  - Create Learning Experiences: Develop scripts, demos, and hands-on projects that engage learners emotionally and intellectually
  
  - Guide Learners: Walk through live coding sessions, troubleshoot common pitfalls, and celebrate "aha!" moments
  
  - Maintain Content: Keep your courses cutting-edge as technology evolves, ensuring learners always get current, relevant knowledge
  
  - Bring Your Personality: Connect with learners through your unique teaching style—we want instructors who are authentically themselves
  
  **Minimum Qualifications**
  
  - Experience: 8+ years backend engineering (distributed services, APIs, data), including experience with LLM-powered applications.
  
  - Languages: Proficiency in Python or Go; strong API design and service ownership.
  
  - LLMs: Prompting, tool/function calling, RAG, embeddings, evaluation fundamentals, and model limitations/safety.
  
  - Data: SQL (e.g., Postgres), caching (e.g., Redis), queues/streams (e.g., Kafka), and schema design.
  
  - Cloud: Containers (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), and a major cloud (AWS).
  
  - Communication: Clear written and spoken English; willingness to present on camera and learn teaching best practices.
  
  - Quality: Solid testing practices, code reviews, monitoring/logging/tracing, and performance tuning.
  
  **Preferred Qualifications**
  
  - Agents: Experience with agent frameworks (e.g., OpenAI Agents SDK) or custom orchestration.
  
  - Evaluation: Evals frameworks, rubric design, offline/online metrics, A/B testing.
  
  - Search/Retrieval: Vector databases (pgvector/Pinecone), RAG patterns at scale.
  
  - Teaching: Prior teaching, course creation, or on-camera experience is a plus—but not required.
  
  **Who You Are**
  
  - You light up when explaining how things work
  
  - You believe great engineering includes great documentation and teaching
  
  - You're excited about being the face and voice guiding thousands of learners
  
  **Our Stack**
  
  - Core: Python, Go, Postgres, Redis.
  
  - AI/ML: OpenAI API and Agents SDK, embeddings, vector DBs (pgvector/Pinecone).
  
  - Infra/DevEx: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitHub Actions).
  
  - Observability: Datadog.
  
  **How We Work**
  
  - Ownership: Small, autonomous teams with clear problem statements and outcome metrics.
  
  - Pragmatism: Ship iteratively, measure impact, and refine with learner-centered feedback loops.
  
  - Quality: Design docs, code reviews, automated tests, and operational excellence.
  
  - On-Camera Support: Producer guidance, templates, and coaching to help you be effective and comfortable on camera.
