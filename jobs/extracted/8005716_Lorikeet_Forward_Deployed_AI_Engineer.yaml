  **About Lorikeet**
  
  Lorikeet is the most powerful customer support AI for complex businesses like fintechs, healthtechs, marketplaces and delivery services.
  
  We’re doing this by building ground up from the premise that most support responses should be automated with transparent, customizable AI, and that support teams should spend their time managing automation and engaging with complex cases, not grinding through high volumes of simple tickets. Once teams are freed from reactive support, we want to help them tackle what’s next: providing personalized concierge services to their customers.
  
  To deliver this combination of powerful AI systems and well designed tooling we’re leveraging Jamie’s experience as an early member of Google’s generative AI team and Steve’s experience building for operational teams at Stripe, as well as the experience of our team who’ve joined us from places like Stripe, Canva, Atlassian, Dropbox and Dovetail.
  
  We are growing fast, have paying customers, real revenue, an exciting roadmap and a strong sales pipeline. We’ve raised over USD 50m from leading VCs and angel investors, including QED, Blackbird, Square Peg, Claire Hughes Johnson (ex Stripe COO), Cristina Cordova (Linear COO), Bob Van Winden (Stripe Head of Support), and Cos Nicolaescu (Brex CTO).
  
  ****Our global customers include:****
  - 
  
  The largest telehealth company in Australia,
  
  - 
  
  The largest bank for teens in the US,
  
  - 
  
  One of the largest NFT marketplaces by trading volume
  
  - 
  
  One of the largest Web3 gaming companies
  
  … and a handful of other enterprise customers with over 1 million support tickets a year.
  
  **What’s unique about this opportunity?**
  - 
  
  **Warm, mature, flexible culture.** Low ego, high trust team. No tolerance for ‘talented jerks’. We embrace a) working efficiently, and b) working flexible hours to fit in life priorities outside of work. We’re committed to building a diverse team and really encourage folks from underrepresented backgrounds to reach out - we value user obsession and eagerness to learn over traditional credentials.
  
  - 
  
  **High pay, high expectations, high performance.** We’re building a small, great team. We aim to match unicorn / scale up pay at base salary and offer a potentially life-changing equity stake in the business. Our team get the same monthly updates we send to our investors because they’re investors and owners too.
  
  - 
  
  **On the technical cutting edge.** With our users we’re defining what an AI-first SaaS product looks like. No one has figured out what the UI/UX, capabilites and data models of an AI first company are - it’s white space for us to invent. The AI agent problems we’re solving are beyond the cutting edge at the biggest research labs. We’re building on a modern tech stack, with Typescript, React/Remix, PrismaORM, NestJS and some Python sprinkled in. Knowledge of that stack is nice, but we know good engineers will pick up new languages.
  
  - 
  
  **No nonsense recruitment process.** The process is: 1) informal chats with Steve and Jamie to hear our pitch and understand your interests and goals, 2) a ~two day paid work trial where you come in and ship with us. There’s no better way for each of us to figure out if we like working together than to work together!
  
  ****About the role and you****
  
  This is a unique role that will have an immediate impact on Lorikeet’s growth by directly addressing one of our customers’ biggest opportunities to-date: getting Lorikeet trained up and deployed as fast as possible!
  
  As a Forward Deployed AI Engineer at Lorikeet, you'll be the bridge between Lorikeet's technology and our clients' success. You'll work directly with customers to understand their needs, implement AI solutions, and ensure they get maximum value from Lorikeet.
  
  You’ll serve as an AI expert for our customers, integration expert, and problem solver, forging strong relationships and great outcomes for their customers. This is a unique opportunity to take a technical background or mindset and a curiosity about AI and turn it into a high impact career.
  
  Over time, you’re going to break new ground with our customers and help them enable mind-blowing experiences for their end users. The sky is the limit for what you’ll be able to help our customers do, and for the right candidate, that’s the most exciting part.
  
  ****The right candidate****
  
  Candidly, this role is perfect for someone who is (1) deeply interested in AI, (2) is excited to build technical skills relevant to AI, and (3) is energized by operating at the nexus of the technical implementation of AI and ensuring customer success.
  
  We need someone who is technically-minded and excited to dive into the technical aspects of AI, loves building, learning, and tinkering, and most importantly, is hyper-focused on customer impact.
  
  As an early team member, you’ll have the agency to identify what needs to be done and take initiative to make it happen. You'll have the opportunity to shape not just individual client implementations, but also our overall approach to customer deployment and success.
  
  Our customers and revenue are >50% in the US, but today most of our team and our headquarters is in Sydney, Australia, where we’d love to host you for onboarding.
  
  **What you’ll do**
  - 
  
  Be an AI expert and evangelist for Lorikeet’s customer base
  
  - 
  
  Lead AI implementation projects from kickoff to successful deployment

  **You might be a fit if you**
  - 
  
  Have significant years of client-facing experience in management consulting, technical implementation, or similar roles
  
  - 
  
  Have a technical background, training or mindset. This may be a CS or engineering major, experience in math or stats, or a track record of learning and using technical skills (e.g. building with no or low code tools, doing data analysis, etc.). Previous software engineering experience *is not* required, but is very useful.
  
  - 
  
  Are a strong project leader with a track record of independently leading complex technical solutions (e.g. you are organized, reliable, and extremely high-agency)
  
  - 
  
  Have experience building & managing stakeholder relationships (e.g. you’re very comfortable working with external clients)
  
  - 
  
  Possess strong communication skills (e.g. you can effectively listen on all levels, *and* have the ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders)
  
  - 
  
  Have a solution-oriented mindset (e.g. you love to think creatively to solve problems and “hack” systems to do unexpected things)
  
  - 
  
  Are excited about AI, knowledgeable and already tinkers with it (e.g. you’re a ChatGPT power user, or build AI projects in your spare time)
  
  Applicants must be based in the United States and eligible to work in the US without sponsorship (remote work supported)
  
  If you don't quite match this *and* are from and under-represented background we strongly encourage you to reach out. We know first hand that diverse teams are higher performing and are proud that our team reflects a broad spectrum of identities and lived experiences.
