  We built Bubble with a clear mission in mind: to empower
  everyone to create software. We believe anyone with an idea
  should be able to build it, so we’re making software
  creation accessible to everyone. Our AI visual development
  platform enables anyone, whether they’re first-time
  entrepreneurs or enterprise teams, to take an idea from
  prompt to fully-functional, scalable reality across web,
  iOS, and Android — all on one platform, all without writing
  or managing a single line of code.  As the only full-stack,
  cross-device no-code platform on the market with over 5
  million users in over 100 countries, Bubble is breaking down
  the barriers to entrepreneurship and innovation across the
  globe.
  
  What we’ve achieved:
  
  Our product is working, and we are thriving. Entire VC-
  backed companies have been built entirely on Bubble. After
  finding product market fit and 8 years of bootstrapping, we
  raised a $100 million Series A and we’re one of the fastest-
  growing companies in the New York tech ecosystem.  You can
  build just about anything on Bubble - and our community is
  living proof. More than just launching products, people are
  turning their ideas into real businesses. Mailead grew a
  $10k investment in a Bubble product into a $2M valuation,
  while Faceless.video went from 0 to $1M+ ARR in less than a
  year, among many other examples.
  
  About the team:
  
  We are expanding our AI Engineering Team to build next-
  generation AI-powered development workflows. Our goal is to

    optimization, and NLP pipelines.

    augmented generation (RAG), and dataset curation.

    interactions.
  - Understanding of embeddings, vector search, and AI model
    evaluation.
  - Proficient in relevant languages and tools like Python,
    Typescript, Hugging Face, LangChain, and Mastra.
  - Excellent communication skills and a collaborative mindset.
