  Who We Are:
  
  At Sixfold, we’re building the AI platform that transforms
  how insurers evaluate and price risk. Not just another tool
  that generates summaries or flags issues—we're creating AI
  agents that actually understand risk the way veteran
  underwriters do. Our platform is processing billions in
  premium for some of the world's largest carriers, and we're
  just getting started.
  
  The technical challenges are wild. We're teaching AI to
  understand that a bakery in Florida faces different risks
  than one in Montana. To know when a manufacturing company's
  pivot from toys to medical devices fundamentally changes
  their risk profile. To make million-dollar decisions with
  the same intuition as someone who's been underwriting for 20
  years.
  
  What makes Sixfold special isn't just the technology—it's
  that we're building it with people who deeply understand
  insurance. Our team includes folks who've built and scaled
  carriers, researchers who've pushed the boundaries of AI,
  and engineers who just love solving seemingly impossible
  problems.
  
  We're still early, but the impact is already real. If you
  want to build AI that matters—that affects real businesses,
  real people, and billions in economic activity—Sixfold is
  where you should be. We're not just digitizing insurance.
  We're reimagining what it can be.
  
  Who You Are:
  
  - A smart self-starter: You have a bias for action. You orient
    yourself around solutions and outcomes and don’t wait for
    others to tell you what to do. But you also understand how
    to build alignment and conviction for a decision that
    can’t be taken back easily.
  - A force multiplier: You look for ways to magnify your impact
    and your team’s. When you find a productivity hack, you
    share it with your teammates and build a tool to make it
    easier. You document knowledge for the benefit of future
    teammates. And you lean into AI and automation to improve
    your productivity.
  - An empathetic communicator: You communicate nuanced ideas
    clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in
    writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements,
    you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and
    compromise when needed.
  - A learner: You thrive on learning new things. You can name
    your favorite sources of what’s new in tech and AI, and
    you’re excited to tell us about your latest hack or
    discovery.
  
  What You’ll Do:
  
  As a software engineer at Sixfold, you will:
  
  - Build and deliver quality software. You will write, test,
    and deploy code across our AI pipeline using Python and a
    variety of generative AI and other machine learning tools
    & techniques. You'll work with large language models,
    fine-tune prompts, design evaluation metrics, and
    implement responsible AI practices. You’ll work on team-
    level projects, applying engineering best practices and
    contributing to the team’s technical decision-making.
  - Grow as a full-stack developer. You'll have opportunities to
    build features end-to-end by expanding your skills with
    Ruby on Rails, React and TypeScript. You'll collaborate
    with our product engineers to understand our tech stack
    and how AI capabilities integrate with our web app and
    APIs.
  - Collaborate with cross-functional partners. Our teams
    include product managers, designers, and engineers working
    together to accomplish shared goals. You will collaborate
    with these partners, beginning with problem discovery
    through solution design and delivery. We work in two-week
    cycles and release to production at least once a week.
  - Own your software through its entire lifecycle. In addition
    to shipping code, you will assess our most pressing
    product and engineering problems, identify and design
    solutions, write technical specs, and scope and break down
    projects. You will also spend approximately one week per
    quarter on call, serving as the first line of defense
    against service outages and critical bugs. If you don’t
    have experience with all of this yet, don’t worry - we’ll
    teach you!
  
  Qualifications:
  
  - You have 3+ years of professional software engineering
    experience.
  - You are familiar with Python and FastAPI and know their
    patterns well enough to build features and APIs without
    significant learning time. Extra credit if you have
    experience with Pydantic, Notebooks, or Streamlit.
  - You have experience building Retrieval-Augmented Generation
    (RAG) systems using vector databases (e.g., Weaviate,
    Pinecone, FAISS, or pgvector) and large language models
    (LLMs). You understand embedding generation, chunking
    strategies, and retrieval optimization to improve response
    accuracy and performance. Extra credit if you have
    experience fine-tuning or orchestrating LLM workflows.
  - You want to work in an early-stage, fast-growth tech
    company. You are comfortable with ambiguity and change.
    You can own problems and proactively devise solutions, not
    just wait for somebody to feed you tasks to execute.
  - You love communication, collaboration, and execution. You
    value meaningful commit messages and pull request
    descriptions and prefer to merge your PRs within a day or
    two. You appreciate healthy engineering debates but know
    how to make pragmatic decisions. You take feedback well
    and are candid with the feedback you give.
  
  Additional Information:
  
  - Expected full-time salary range between $100,000 to $195,000
    + equity + benefits.
