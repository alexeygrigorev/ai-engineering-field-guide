  We Breathe Life Into Data
  
  At Komodo Health, our mission is to reduce the global burden
  of disease. And we believe that smarter use of data is
  essential to this mission. That’s why we built the
  Healthcare Map — the industry’s largest, most complete,
  precise view of the U.S. healthcare system — by combining
  de-identified, real-world patient data with innovative
  algorithms and decades of clinical experience. The
  Healthcare Map serves as our foundation for a powerful suite
  of software applications, helping us answer healthcare’s
  most complex questions for our partners. Across the
  healthcare ecosystem, we’re helping our clients unlock
  critical insights to track detailed patient behaviors and
  treatment patterns, identify gaps in care, address unmet
  patient needs, and reduce the global burden of disease.
