  We built Bubble with a clear mission in mind: to empower everyone to create software. We believe anyone with an idea should be able to build it, so we’re making software creation accessible to everyone. Our AI visual development platform enables anyone, whether they’re first-time entrepreneurs or enterprise teams, to take an idea from prompt to fully-functional, scalable reality across web, iOS, and Android — all on one platform, all without writing or managing a single line of code. 
  As the only full-stack, cross-device no-code platform on the market with over 5 million users in over 100 countries, Bubble is breaking down the barriers to entrepreneurship and innovation across the globe.

  You can build just about anything on Bubble - and our community is living proof. More than just launching products, people are turning their ideas into real businesses. Mailead grew a $10k investment in a Bubble product into a $2M valuation, while Faceless.video went from 0 to $1M+ ARR in less than a year, among many other examples.
