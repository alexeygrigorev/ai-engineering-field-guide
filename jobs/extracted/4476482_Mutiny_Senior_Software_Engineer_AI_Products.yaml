  **Mutiny Overview**
  
  Mutiny is building a first-class agentic GTM platform that unifies sales and marketing to help companies close enterprise deals faster. Our customers are enterprise marketing and sales teams who face a fundamental challenge: *what works isn’t scalable, and what’s scalable doesn’t work.* Mutiny is solving this by combining AI agents, creative workflows, and deep integrations to deliver personalized marketing and sales experiences at scale.
  
  Our customers include some of the fastest-growing B2B companies—Uber, Amplitude, Qualtrics, and LaunchDarkly. We are backed by Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, Insight Partners, and Y Combinator.
  ****About the Role****
  
  We’re looking for a **Senior Software Engineer** to join our engineering team in New York. You’ll architect, build, and own key functionality of our **Campaign Builder** and **AI Agent** experiences—core surfaces that let marketers and sellers generate, edit, and launch personalized campaigns across accounts.
  
  This role is central to how Mutiny brings our agentic vision to life: helping enterprise teams go from idea to personalized assets with speed, trust, and quality. You’ll partner closely with PM and Design to define the end-to-end experience—from conversational AI collaboration to guardrails for brand consistency.
  
  📍 This role is **based in NYC** and requires being **in-person 5 days a week**.
  **What you’ll do:**
  - Build all across the stack to deliver a world class AI agent that helps sales and marketing teams create breakthrough experiences.
  
  - Work with top notch AI tooling from cloud based coding agents, agent networks 
  
  - Collaborate closely with design and product to build AI-powered features that drive real customer value.
  
  - Build scalable and resilient systems on top of the inherently non-deterministic nature of LLMs.
  
  - Help grow our engineering team to tackle a huge opportunity.
  
  - Contribute to our culture of engineering excellence and work at the bleeding edge of AI development.
  ****What you bring**:**
  - 5+ years of experience in software engineering
  
  - Proficiency in a backend language like Python, TypeScript, Kotlin, or Ruby.
  
  - You have a “full-stack” mindset — you can be autonomous in implementing features e2e which helps you design features that deliver customer value.
  
  - You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time.
  
  - You love to collaborate with engineers across the spectrum of seniority and experiences.
  
  - Someone who is energized by ambiguity and can create structure in a dynamic, fast-paced environment.
  
  - Familiarity with LLM techniques (RAG, vector databases, LangChain, agent frameworks) is a plus.
  ****What you’ll get out of it:****
  - You will create a name for yourself by getting to work with and support some of the fastest-growing companies in B2B SaaS.
  
  - You will get exposure to real business problems every company faces (growth) that you can take with you to start your own company (or to help scale another).
  
  - You will work directly with our founders and leaders to deliver product outcomes that have substantial impact on company trajectory.
  
  - You will contribute to our in-person culture, being a critical voice in hiring and defining who we are.
  
  - You will have fun, plain and simple. There is a reason our first company value is that work should feel like play.
  **Hiring process for this role:**
  
  The hiring process for this role looks like this:
  
  - **Hiring Manager Phone Screen** (30 minutes): you’ll meet with our CTO to discuss your experience in engineering AI or data powered systems and how this role aligns with your career goals.
  
  - **Technical Screen **(60 minutes): you'll meet with one of our engineers to work through a coding challenge to understand your technical ability.
  
  - **Virtual Onsite** (two 90 minute technical interviews, one 60 minute culture interview): you’ll meet with more members of the team to dive deeper into your experience and see if there’s potential for a great fit at Mutiny.
