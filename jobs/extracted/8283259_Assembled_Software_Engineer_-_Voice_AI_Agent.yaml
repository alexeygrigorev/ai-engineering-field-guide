  About Assembled
  
  Great customer support requires human agents and AI in
  perfect balance, and Assembled is the only unified platform
  that orchestrates both at scale. Companies like Canva, Etsy,
  and Robinhood use Assembled to coordinate their entire
  support operation — in-house agents, BPOs, and AI — in a
  single operating system. With AI Agents that resolve cases
  end-to-end, AI Copilot for agent assistance, and AI-powered
  workforce management that optimizes both human and AI
  capacity, Assembled helps teams deliver faster, better
  service while making smarter decisions about how to staff
  and automate. Backed by $70M from NEA, Emergence Capital,
  and Stripe, we're building the platform that makes AI and
  human collaboration actually work.
  
  The Team
  
  Our Voice AI team is building autonomous AI agents that
  handle inbound calls for customer support, allowing human
  agents to focus on high-value interactions. This initiative
  is vital for our vision of creating the ultimate omni-
  channel AI customer support agent. After launching our AI
  Assist product, we've seen tremendous growth with a strong
  pipeline of deals, making this one of the fastest growing
  areas both inside our company and across the industry.
  
  We're currently one of the largest companies deploying voice
  AI in production at massive scale. By joining our team,
  you'll be on the cutting edge of this exciting trend,
  working with real-world deployments at leading tech
  companies. The engineering challenges are exciting and
  largely unsolved: achieving the perfect balance between AI
  agent intelligence, latency, cost, and scale while building
  autonomous voice agents that can reliably handle customer
  conversations. You'll be designing systems that scale across
  communication channels and pushing the boundaries of what's
  possible with current LLM and voice technology.
  
  Your Impact
  
  As a Voice AI Agent Software Engineer, you will be
  partnering with our team to build our new AI-based voice
  agent that answers inbound customer support calls. No prior
  AI experience is required – we'll provide on-the-job
  training and mentorship. This is a unique opportunity for a
  highly motivated and experienced software engineer to
  transition into AI development while working with a
  specialized team.
  
  Your Day-to-Day
  
  - Building high-quality software for our voice AI platform,
    from rapid prototypes that push the boundaries of what's
    possible to production-ready, scalable solutions
  - Continuously improving our AI capabilities and accuracy
    through experimentation, data analysis, and innovative
    approaches
  - Implementing and optimizing LLM and voice technology while
    balancing intelligence, latency, and cost
  - Collaborating across engineering and cross-functional teams
    to tackle challenging technical problems throughout the
    full lifecycle of our voice AI products - from ideation
    and prototyping to deployment and monitoring
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Build foundational voice features: Develop voice-specific
    product features from the ground up, such as implementing
    voice recognition capabilities powered by LLMs and
    intelligent categorization of incoming calls. You'll help
    design and build intuitive interfaces for support agents
    to monitor and interact with AI voice assistants.
  - Improve LLM model results for voice applications: Enhance
    our voice recognition and generation engine using advanced
    techniques. You'll help us leverage implicit knowledge
    bases to improve model performance in voice contexts.
  - Develop voice AI infrastructure: Architect the abstractions
    that enable integration of various types of LLMs tailored
    for voice applications. You'll design and implement
    evaluation and logging systems to monitor performance.
  - Engage with customers: Collaborate with our customers (both
    support agents and managers) to understand how they
    interact with our voice product, and how we can improve
    their experience.
  - Wear many hats: Be versatile in roles — coding, user
    research, planning, brainstorming, and cross-team
    collaboration.
  - Shape the team culture: Encourage a startup mentality
    focused on product quality and taking initiative.
