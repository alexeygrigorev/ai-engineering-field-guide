  Who we are
  
  Samsara (NYSE: IOT) is the pioneer of the Connected
  Operations™ Cloud, which is a platform that enables
  organizations that depend on physical operations to harness
  Internet of Things (IoT) data to develop actionable insights
  and improve their operations. At Samsara, we are helping
  improve the safety, efficiency and sustainability of the
  physical operations that power our global economy.
  Representing more than 40% of global GDP, these industries
  are the infrastructure of our planet, including agriculture,
  construction, field services, transportation, and
  manufacturing — and we are excited to help digitally
  transform their operations at scale.
  
  Working at Samsara means you’ll help define the future of
  physical operations and be on a team that’s shaping an
  exciting array of product solutions, including Video-Based
  Safety, Vehicle Telematics, Apps and Driver Workflows, and
  Equipment Monitoring. As part of a recently public company,
  you’ll have the autonomy and support to make an impact as we
  build for the long term.
  
  About the role:
  
  We are seeking a Senior Applied Scientist II to join our
  Supply Chain Innovation & Intelligence team. In this role,
  you’ll be responsible for designing, developing, and
  deploying advanced machine learning and statistical models
  that optimize and transform our global supply chain. From
  forecasting demand across thousands of SKUs to modeling
  supply risk using real-time IoT signals, you’ll apply
  cutting-edge techniques to solve complex problems with
  direct business impact.
  
  You’ll work alongside data scientists, software engineers,
  and domain experts, collaborating cross-functionally with
  teams in Product, Engineering, Procurement, and Finance.
  You’ll report to the Director of Supply Chain Innovation &
  Intelligence and play a key role in shaping the team’s
  roadmap, scientific agenda, and modeling standards.
  
  This role is ideal for a deeply technical IC who thrives in
  ambiguity, thinks strategically, and enjoys end-to-end
  ownership—from ideation to deployment.
  
  This role is open to candidates residing in the US except
  the San Francisco Bay Metro Area, NYC Metro Area, and
  Washington, D.C. Metro Area.
  
  You should apply if:
  
  - You are motivated by impact: Your work will drive smarter,
    faster, and more sustainable supply chain decisions across
    Samsara’s operations.
  - You combine scientific rigor with real-world pragmatism:
    You’re skilled at navigating trade-offs between model
    complexity, performance, and maintainability.
  - You want to work on hard problems: You’ll help tackle
    forecasting volatility, cost optimization, anomaly
    detection, and more using large, noisy, high-dimensional
    datasets.
  - You are a self-directed leader: You identify analytical
    white space, set multi-quarter plans, and mentor others
    through influence.
  - You enjoy building models that matter: Your solutions will
    be deployed in production, drive decisions, and be
    regularly evaluated against business KPIs.
  
  In this role, you will:
  
  - Define the end-to-end AI transformation roadmap for supply
    chain alongside the Director, aligning with company OKRs
    and working closely with executive stakeholders.
  - Own the design, training, validation, and deployment of ML
    and statistical models.(e.g., demand forecasting,
    inventory optimization, supplier risk scoring), ensuring
    robust MLOps practices and measurable ROI.
  - Build predictive models to forecast demand, lead times, and
    cellular spend across Samsara’s global supply network.
  - Create novel features using large-scale ERP, IoT, and third-
    party datasets; build pipelines and ETL jobs to serve
    models and stakeholders.
  - Deliver production-grade code that supports both batch and
    real-time inference with MLOps best practices.
  - Act as the AI liaison to Product, Engineering, Procurement,
    and Finance—ensuring alignment on data requirements,
    integration, and change management.
  - Drive enhancements to our data infrastructure and analytics
    platform to support real-time model training, monitoring,
    and inference at scale.
  - Mentor junior scientists through code reviews and
    collaborative project work.
  - Act as a key scientific voice in roadmap planning,
    experimentation frameworks, and modeling strategy
    discussions.
  - Identify gaps in data, tools, and processes—and lead
    initiatives to close them.
  - Establish governance frameworks, documentation standards,
    and quality controls for model development, validation,
    and lifecycle management.
  - Partner with Ops management to drive adoption of AI tools,
    define new processes, and train supply chain teams on
    insights-driven workflows.
  - Hire, develop and lead an inclusive, engaged, and high-
    performing team.
  - Champion, role model, and embed Samsara’s cultural
    principles (Focus on Customer Success, Build for the Long
    Term, Adopt a Growth Mindset, Be Inclusive, Win as a Team)
    as we scale globally and across new offices.
  
  Minimum requirements for the role:
  
  - 8+ years of experience in applied data science or machine
    learning, ideally in supply chain, operations research,
    logistics, or manufacturing.
  - Master’s or PhD in Computer Science, Statistics, Data
    Science, EE, OR, or a related technical field.
  - Expertise in statistical modeling or machine learning,
    including time series forecasting, optimization, and
    anomaly detection.
  - Strong coding skills in Python and fluency in SQL;
    experience developing and deploying production ML systems.
  - Familiarity with MLOps practices, including automated
    testing, CI/CD, model versioning, and monitoring.
  - Demonstrated track record building real-time inference
    pipelines and managing GPU/TPU resources.
  - Familiarity with data visualization tools (e.g., Tableau,
    Power BI) and cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure).
  - A passion for operational excellence, cost efficiency, and
    building scalable, data-driven solutions.
  - Exceptional problem-solving, critical thinking, and
    communication abilities.
  
  An ideal candidate also has:
  
  - Deep Statistical Expertise: Able to design and validate
    experiments (A/B, multi-armed bandits) and apply Bayesian
    methods for uncertainty quantification.
  - Time-Series Mastery: Proven track record building advanced
    forecasting models (e.g., Prophet, LSTMs, Transformer-
    based) for intermittent demand and seasonal patterns.
  - Cost Optimization Mindset: Skilled in profiling ML workloads
    and driving down cloud/GPU spend through model compression
    (quantization, pruning) and serverless architectures.
  - Cross-Region Scaling: Demonstrated ability to deploy low-
    latency inference across multiple geographic regions with
    fail-over and disaster-recovery strategies.
  - Vendor & Open-Source Savvy: Experience evaluating and
    integrating third-party ML platforms and contributing to
    or leveraging relevant open-source projects.
