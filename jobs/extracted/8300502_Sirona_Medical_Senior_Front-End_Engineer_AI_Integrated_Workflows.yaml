  About Sirona Medical
  
  At Sirona Medical, we’re building software that enables
  physicians to work as fast as they can think.
  
  Each year in the U.S., billions of patient images are
  captured—and nearly all of them are reviewed and diagnosed
  by radiologists. These specialists are the central hub of
  diagnostic medicine: over 80% of all healthcare data flows
  through radiology IT systems. Yet despite their pivotal
  role, radiologists are overburdened by outdated, fragmented
  software which limits their efficiency and ultimately the
  quality and efficiency of care that health systems can
  provide patients. That’s where Sirona comes in.
  
  We’re a San Francisco-based, cloud-native software company
  with employees around the world. Our deep understanding of
  both the practice and business of radiology has allowed us
  to build RadOS—a unified, AI-powered operating system
  powering the entire radiology workflows.
  
  How Sirona Solves the Problem
  
  Sirona is uniquely positioned to transform the way radiology
  is practiced. We're delivering the organizational shift that
  both individual radiologists and entire practices urgently
  need:
  
  - A unified, intuitive, and platform-agnostic solution
  - A streamlined workspace that makes every part of the
    radiologist’s workflow faster and easier
  - The freedom to read from anywhere, for anyone
  
  By cutting clicks, optimizing diagnostic time, and unlocking
  efficiencies that extend far beyond the reading room into
  all care settings, Sirona empowers radiologists—and in doing
  so, we help the entire healthcare system move faster,
  smarter, and with greater impact on patient outcomes.

  We’re seeking a Senior Front-End Engineer to help design and
  build the next generation of intelligent, highly responsive
  user experiences at Sirona.
  
  You’ll join our Innovation team,  a fast-moving group
  exploring how advanced AI, agentic workflows, and multimodal
  systems can unlock new clinical workflows. Your focus will
  be on creating intuitive, performant, and extensible UIs
  that bring these AI capabilities to life.
  
  This is a front-end–heavy, full-stack role: you’ll architect
  core SDKs and reusable components, define contracts with
  backend and AI services, and prototype next-generation
  experiences that help radiologists work faster and smarter.
  
  You’ll collaborate closely with designers, backend
  engineers, and AI researchers to explore what’s possible and
  help bring the most impactful ideas into production.
  
  Sirona Medical is a remote first company but this role will
  be required to travel to our San Francisco office on average
  of 3-4 days every other quarter.
