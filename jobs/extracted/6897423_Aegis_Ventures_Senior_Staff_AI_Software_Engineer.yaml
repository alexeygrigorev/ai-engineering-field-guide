  About Caregentic
  
  Caregentic is transforming how healthcare organizations
  deliver patient care in the real world by developing a
  modern platform with AI-powered patient engagement. We’re
  solving complex challenges in patient care with
  sophisticated technology: Care journey orchestration, health
  data integration, and clinical workflows. We relieve
  healthcare providers of daily frustrations, so they can
  focus on what matters most: caring for patients.
  
  Founded by a team that understands both the technical
  challenges and clinical realities of modern healthcare,
  we're co-developing a platform with leading health systems
  like Northwell Health, giving us access to real-world
  feedback and validation from day one. This unique
  partnership means our work is refined and improved in real
  clinical environments.
  
  We're at an exciting inflection point — our early customers
  are seeing measurable improvements in care delivery and
  operational efficiency, and we’re ready to grow our team
  with an experienced, senior engineer who can help scale our
  impact in the industry.
  
  About the Job
  
  As a Senior or Staff AI Software Engineer at Caregentic, you
  will have end-to-end ownership of key parts of our backend
  services architecture and our AI-drive applications. You
  will work on our modern micro-service architecture, built
  with Python 3.12, FastAPI, Strawberry GraphQL, and event-
  driven design principles.
  
  You will be responsible for building scalable, resilient
  systems that drive real impact in patient care while also
  helping shape the technical direction of the platform and
  mentoring other engineers. Our team operates with the
  urgency that healthcare demands, and we never lose sight
  that our work directly impacts patient lives.
  
  We’ve been a fully remote team from the start, distributed
  across the U.S. We believe that great engineering happens
  wherever people do their best work.

  - Apollo Federation (GraphQL gateway)
  - React and TypeScript web frontend
  - Rasa (fork) with spaCy 3, Rasa SDK (custom action server)
  - LangChain, LangChain, AWS Bedrock, LangSmith (tracing/evals)
  - Vector search: Databricks Vector Search
  
  What You'll Do:
  
  - Design and develop robust, scalable, event-driven services
    using Python, FastAPI, Apache Kafka and GraphQL.

    systems (LangChain), agentic workflows, and evaluation
    pipelines (LangSmith, deepeval, A/B testing).
  - Own vector search & embeddings pipelines from schema and
    metadata design to model benchmarking, cost/latency
    optimization, and Databricks Vector Search integration.
  - Lead conversational AI development enhancing NLU policies,
    safety guardrails, and custom action servers, plus
    integrating assistants with microservices.
  
  What You'll Need:
  
  - 7+ years of backend development experience in production
    environments, specifically strong Python skills, including
    async programming and type hints.

  - Experience with microservice architectures is preferred.
  - Experience with GraphQL APIs.
  - Experience with event-driven systems and message queues.
  - Experience with major cloud providers (e.g., AWS).
  - Shipped production LLM systems: ideally RAG architectures,
    agent/tool use, and prompt/system design, with LangChain
    (tracing/evals via LangSmith), embeddings, and vector
    databases (Databricks Vector Search preferred). Deep
    expertise in retrieval quality, including chunking,
    metadata, hybrid search, reranking, and grounding.

  Why Caregentic? Join us in building the next generation of
  healthcare technology that improves patient outcomes and
  transforms the industry!
  
  Healthcare teams shouldn't have to wrestle with fragmented
  systems, duplicate data entry, or workflows that break down
  when they need them most. Our unified platform leverages AI
  to connect the dots between patient data, clinical
  protocols, and care coordination, automatically surfacing
  insights and streamlining processes to create seamless
  experiences that improve outcomes while reducing
  administrative burden.
  
  At Caregentic, we believe the future of healthcare
  technology isn't about replacing human judgment, but
  amplifying it with intelligent automation. Our AI-driven
  platform learns from clinical patterns and workflows to make
  smart recommendations, automate routine tasks, and surface
  critical insights at exactly the right moment. Every line of
  code we write, every AI model we deploy, and every platform
  integration we create is designed with one goal: helping
  healthcare professionals provide better care more
  efficiently.
  
  This is a rare opportunity to work on cutting-edge
  technology that directly impacts patient care, alongside a
  team that moves fast, learns from real clinical feedback,
  and builds with purpose. We're backed by top-tier health
  systems like Northwell Health, and we’re at a pivotal growth
