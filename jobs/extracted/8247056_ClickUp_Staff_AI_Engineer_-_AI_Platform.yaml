  Role Overview:
  
  We are seeking a highly skilled and experienced Staff AI
  Engineer – AI Platform to join our ClickUp Engineering team.
  In this role, you will play a critical part in both building
  the core AI platform and directly applying large language
  models (LLMs) to deliver intelligent features across
  ClickUp. You will focus on backend systems that enable
  scalable, reliable, and secure AI-powered capabilities,
  while also working hands-on with LLMs to solve real user
  problems and drive product innovation.
  
  Key Responsibilities:
  
  - Architect, design, and implement scalable AI platform
    services that support the deployment, orchestration, and
    lifecycle management of LLMs and other AI models.
  - Apply LLMs and other AI technologies directly to build and
    enhance ClickUp’s intelligent features, working closely
    with product and engineering teams to deliver impactful
    solutions.
  - Build and maintain robust APIs and backend systems that
    enable seamless integration of AI-powered features into
    ClickUp’s core platform.
  - Develop infrastructure for model serving, monitoring,
    logging, and automated evaluation to ensure high
    reliability and performance of AI services in production.
  - Integrate with multiple LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI,
    Anthropic, Google) and manage model selection, routing,
    and fallback strategies for optimal performance and cost.
  - Drive the adoption of best practices in AI privacy,
    security, and compliance, including data anonymization,
    secure data handling, and regulatory adherence.
  - Optimize platform performance, scalability, and cost-
    efficiency, leveraging cloud-native technologies and
    distributed systems.
  - Stay current with advancements in AI infrastructure, MLOps,
    and LLM applications, and proactively incorporate relevant
    innovations into ClickUp’s AI platform.
  - Collaborate cross-functionally with product, frontend, and
    data teams to deliver seamless, reliable, and user-centric
    AI experiences.
  
  Qualifications:
  
  - Extensive experience designing and building scalable AI/ML
    platforms or infrastructure in a production environment.
  - Proven track record of applying LLMs and AI models to real-
    world product features and user-facing solutions.
  - Deep expertise in backend engineering, distributed systems,
    and cloud-native technologies (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker,
    AWS/GCP/Azure).
  - Proven experience integrating and managing multiple LLMs and
    AI models, with a strong understanding of their
    operational requirements and limitations.
  - Proficiency in orchestration frameworks and workflow engines
    (e.g., LangGraph, Airflow, Kubeflow, Ray, or similar).
  - Strong programming skills in Python, Go, TypeScript or
    similar languages used for backend and AI platform
    development.
  - Experience with MLOps best practices, including model
    deployment, monitoring, logging, and automated evaluation.
  - Demonstrated ability to address AI privacy and security
    challenges, including data anonymization and compliance
    with data protection regulations.
  - Familiarity with search technologies and their integration
    into AI-driven applications.
  - Excellent collaboration and communication skills, with a
    track record of working effectively in cross-functional
    teams.
  - Passion for staying at the forefront of AI infrastructure
    and applying new technologies to solve real-world problems
    at scale.
