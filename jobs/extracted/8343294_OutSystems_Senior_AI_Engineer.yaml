  There are NO limits to your career: come shape the future
  and be part of a truly unique global culture at OutSystems!
  
  About This Role
  
  As a Senior AI Engineer in our Artificial Intelligence
  Group, you will be working on our Mentor line of products.
  Your main role will be to design and bring to life AI
  products and features applied to the problem of Enterprise
  Vibe Coding (vibe coding for “serious software”), covering
  the full Software Development Lifecycle. To do this, you
  will work alongside the rest of the group to push the state-
  of-the-art and build the next generation of AI-native
  developer tools. The sky's the limit and you’ll help us get
  there.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Stay up to date with the state-of-the-art in Artificial
    Intelligence and Machine Learning, and apply it to the
    problem of Enterprise Vibe Coding;
  - Make use of techniques such as In-Context Learning (Prompt
    Engineering & Retrieval Augmented Generation) and Tool
    Calling to guide Agents to perform as intended;
  - Work in an “eval-driven development” methodology, applying
    evaluation techniques such as model-based critiques,
    semantic accuracy benchmarks, and tool-use success rates
    as the basis for developing robust, reliable, and
    production-ready LLM Agents;
  - Work across the entire lifecycle of product development,
    from ideation, through prototyping and designing to
    implementation and evaluation;
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to ship and iterate
    on production-grade AI products;
  - Own the end-to-end development of AI features of a customer-
    facing product, ensuring software quality, observability
    and scalability;
  - Be a thought leader in the space, advancing the field by
    putting the most forward ideas into practice in a large-
    scale project.
  
  Qualifications / What You Need To Succeed
  
  - Ph.D. or MSc degree in Computer Science, Electrical
    Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or
    related technical fields is highly valued.
  - 5+ years of work experience in Machine Learning and AI
    Engineering roles, preferably building with LLMs and/or
    Agentic Systems, from development to production.
  - Hands-on experience with LLM frameworks (e.g. langchain,
    langgraph, llamaindex, langsmith), AI platforms (e.g.
    Databricks, mlflow) and containerization solutions (e.g.
    Docker) is valued.
  - Strong software engineering fundamentals and proficiency in
    Python are a must.
  - Be creative, ambitious and curious. Be resourceful and
    innovative.
  
  The Longer Story:
  
  OutSystems enables enterprise teams to build AI-powered
  applications and agents that reduce manual work, streamline
  internal operations, and accelerate impact. A proven low-
  code foundation combined with agentic AI and AI app
  generation capabilities empowers teams to move up to 10x
  faster with the assurance of security, scalability, and
  governance built in.
  
  As the future becomes agentic, our customers need us now
  more than ever. AI has opened the door to extraordinary
  possibilities—but inside the enterprise, things are moving
  fast and feeling chaotic. Some early adopters are making
  progress in production, but for many, AI tools are sprawling
  without governance, data isn’t ready, and talent isn’t there
  yet. Enterprises are still drowning in application backlogs
  and struggling with legacy systems. But with the right
  platform, AI doesn’t have to add to the chaos. It can become
  the breakthrough that brings clarity—and drives real,
  enterprise-wide impact. At OutSystems, we’ve built that
  platform, providing the tools necessary for enterprises to
  overcome these hurdles.
  
  We are looking for passionate, talented, and motivated
  people to join us in helping our customers build, deploy,
  and scale apps and agents—fast, helping them accelerate
  innovation while enabling secure, governed human-AI
  collaboration.
  
  OutSystems is a truly global company, with more than 850,000
  developer community members, 1,700 employees, more than 500
  partners, and thousands of active customers in over 75
  countries and across 21 industries. Founded in 2001,
  OutSystems has offices in the United States, United Kingdom,
  the Netherlands, Portugal, Germany, the UAE, Japan, Hong
  Kong, Malaysia, Australia, India, and Singapore, and of
  course has a thriving, worldwide community of remote
  employees.
  
  Amongst our customers are some of the world's most
  recognizable brands across diverse industries—brands like
  Toyota, Heineken, Bosch, KeyBank, and UCLA. These customers
  are the reason we have a 4.6 star rating on G2. Their
  success is ours, and their stories demonstrate tangible ROI
  and transformational impact. We are a 9x Gartner Magic
  Quadrant Leader for Low-Code Application Platforms and a
  multi-year leader in the Forrester Wave. We’re recognized
  not just as leaders but as visionaries with a strong ability
  to execute, now extending our leadership into the AI and
  agentic application development arena.
  
  Working at OutSystems
  
  Our goal is to ensure that OutSystems is a place for bright,
  happy, and motivated people who share a common purpose and
  take pride in doing excellent work to pursue our vision of
  providing the AI-powered low-code development platform
  enterprise leaders trust to build, secure, and evolve their
  business applications, agents, and core systems. Our culture
  is focused on our core values of trust, customer success,
  innovation, and alignment. Our team members operate with
  transparency, integrity, and accountability, define success
  through the lens of the outcomes we deliver for our
  customers, push the boundaries with excellence, and work
  together toward our shared vision to deliver on what matters
  most.
