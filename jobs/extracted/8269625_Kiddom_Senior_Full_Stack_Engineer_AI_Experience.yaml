  - Turn complex product concepts into robust, reliable AI-
    enhanced user experiences
  - Collaborate closely with product, design, data science, and
    ML engineering partners
  - Contribute to architectural decisions, tooling enhancements,
    and best practices across the stack
  - Leverage AI tools to improve engineering velocity, code
    quality, and experimentation workflows
  
  What We're Looking For...
  
  - 5–7+ years of professional software development experience
  - A full-stack mindset with willingness to work across
    frontend, backend, AI integration layers, and supporting
    infrastructure
  - Strong ability to reason about AI system behavior, model
    limitations, and best practices for safe, reliable
    integration
  - Experience working with data pipelines, experiment
    evaluation, or model performance analysis
  - A collaborative, product-minded engineer who enjoys working
    directly with design and PM partners
  - Someone who embraces fast iteration, incomplete information,
    and continuous learning
  - An AI-native engineer who knows how to select, use, and
    apply AI tools effectively in both development and product
    experiences
  
  Bonus...
  
  - Experience integrating LLMs or ML systems into production
    applicationsFamiliarity with vector databases, embeddings,
    or retrieval-augmented generation
  - CI/CD experience (GitHub Actions or similar)
  - Familiarity with the AWS ecosystem (Lambda, ECS, RDS, k8s,
    containerized applications)
