  About Us:
  
  Homebound is on a mission to make it possible for anyone,
  anywhere, to build a home using technology. Created by an
  experienced team of construction, real estate, design, and
  technology experts, Homebound is transforming the
  residential construction industry by improving the costly
  and inefficient process of building a home.
  
  We’ve created an entirely new way to build homes with
  technology powering every stage from start to finish to
  provide a seamless experience for our customers. Homeowners
  across the country can choose where they want to live,
  select a home plan that’s perfect for them, then personalize
  and buy it, all online. Homebound has raised $150M in
  capital from leading venture capitalists like Google,
  Khosla, Thrive Ventures, and we’re scaling quickly in places
  like Texas, Colorado and Florida. Come build your future
  with us.
  
  Role Overview:
  
  Homebound is seeking an exceptional Senior or Staff level AI
  Engineer to accelerate our mission of building the leading
  vertical AI stack for residential construction. Our
  proprietary platform captures granular data at every stage
  of the homebuilding process, enabling us to develop novel
  LLM-powered applications that improve efficiency and quality
  across the board.
  
  We are a small, fast-moving team with multiple AI products
  already in production and a rapidly growing GenAI platform.
  In this role, you will lead the research and implementation
  of cutting-edge advancements in AI, design and deploy
  impactful features, and collaborate with cross-functional
  teams to shape the future of homebuilding.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Shape the vision for how AI/ML, particularly LLMs, integrate
    into Homebound’s products and operations. Define technical
    standards for experimentation, deployment, and evaluation.
  - Design and build scalable AI systems that can handle real-
    world production workloads and evolve with the business.
  - Deliver high-quality, production-grade code daily while
    ensuring observability, maintainability, and reliability.
  - Raise the bar across engineering by teaching AI best
    practices, reviewing designs, and guiding engineers
    through complex technical challenges.
  - Stay abreast of the rapidly evolving AI landscape, bringing
    forward cutting-edge ideas while focusing investment where
    it creates clear business impact.
  
  What You’ll Bring
  
  - 7+ years of professional software engineering experience,
    with a strong focus on AI/ML systems.
  - Shipped LLM-powered features into production, including
    hands-on experience with prompt engineering, RAG, eval
    frameworks, and agentic workflows.
  - Demonstrated leadership, including mentoring teams,
    influencing technical direction, and being the go-to
    problem solver for complex AI challenges.
  - Fluency in Python and experience with core ML/data libraries
    (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow, Spark).
  - Proven ability to design systems that balance rapid
    experimentation with long-term reliability and
    maintainability.
  
  Who you are:
  
  - You take ownership and seek autonomy over your work and
    outcomes.
  - You’re excited to learn and grow as part of a small, nimble,
    high-impact team.
  - You are self-directed, comfortable prioritizing your own
    work with minimal oversight.
  - You communicate clearly and proactively—especially in
    writing.
  - You’re humble, good-natured, and bring a positive energy to
    your team.
