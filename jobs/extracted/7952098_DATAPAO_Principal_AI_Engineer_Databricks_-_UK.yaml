description: |
  At DATAPAO, data ignites passion, community fuels
  collaboration, and growth knows no bounds. We are a leading
  Data Engineering and Data Science consulting company backed
  by Databricks and recognized for our unmatched delivery
  standards and rapid growth. We have been named Databricks
  EMEA Emerging Business Partner of the Year and have achieved
  a second consecutive appearance on the Financial Times
  FT1000 list.
  
  We are currently looking for a Principal AI Engineer to join
  us remotely in the UK. As we build out our UK hub to support
  our GTM strategy, this role will be our first AI Engineer
  hire, complementing the data engineering and sales teams we
  already have in place. In this role, you will work with our
  EMEA and US customers to help them solve their data
  architecture, ML, ML Ops, GenAI and cloud migration puzzles.
  
  What (exactly) will you do?
  
  As a Principal AI Engineer, your responsibilities will span
  across the following dimensions:
  
  Project Planning & Delivery
  
  In the planning phase of a project, you're expected to lead
  or participate in scoping the engagement, designing high-
  level architecture, defining subtasks, and project delivery
  schedules. After the planning phase is over, you'll deliver
  the project on your own or within a mixed DS/DE team setup
  where you'll oftentimes take the role of a technical lead.
  Furthermore, during the project delivery, you will be
  client-facing, acting as DATAPAO's interface or SPOC to our
  customers.
  
  During non-delivery cycles, you will provide ML/DS
  consultancy to technical teams for our EMEA customers. Our
  customers are either direct DATAPAO customers or coming via
  our Databricks partnership.
  
  Data Science & AI consultancy
  
  As a consultant, you will work closely with Databricks and
  cloud providers to understand the needs and requirements of
  clients. Based on your understanding, you will recommend
  solutions that leverage Databricks or native cloud features.
  Additionally, you will be responsible for conducting
  workshops to enable clients on these platforms.
  
  You are to spearhead Machine Learning and (generative) AI
  projects in the Databricks platform, using the latest
  technologies to deliver real business impact for our top
  customers.
  
  What does it take to fit the bill?
  
  Technical Expertise
  
  - You (ideally) have 5+ years of experience as a Data
    Scientist, with a focus on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure,
    GCP);
  - You have a proven track record working with Databricks
    (PySpark, SQL, Delta Lake, Unity Catalog);
  - You have a good understanding of Large Language Models
    (LLMs), and you are familiar with their
    frameworks/libraries;
  - You have strong Python knowledge of the most common DS
    libraries;
  - Proficiency with MLOps;
  - You have good knowledge of data visualization
    tools/libraries;
  - [BONUS] You are proficient in any deep learning framework;
  - [BONUS] Experience with distributed computing, preferably
    Spark.
  
   Consulting & Client-Facing Skills
  
  - Ideally, you bring a proven history in consulting, from
    scoping to gathering requirements, designing solutions,
    and communicating effectively with stakeholders. If you
    bring a product company background with you, that's also
    fine as long as you can show a good consulting mindset and
    desire to be customer-facing;
  - You’ve successfully delivered projects like end-to-end,
    fully automated ML solutions, or production-ready
    Generative AI applications in Databricks;
  - You excel in explaining technical concepts to non-technical
    audiences and drive decision-making.
  
  Operational Readiness & Soft Skills
  
  - You’re (almost) ready to hit the ground running, immediately
    contributing to live client projects;
  
  - In a fast-paced consulting environment, where no two days
    are the same, flexibility and problem-solving comes
    naturally to you. Furthermore, resilience and thriving on
    challenges are essential traits in our industry;
  
  - Your communication skills are on point—whether you’re
    writing, speaking, or collaborating with stakeholders, you
    know how to keep everyone in the loop.
  
  What do we offer?
  
  You'll have the rare opportunity to join DATAPAO at a time
  when you can still meaningfully impact our growth trajectory
  and organizational success. Furthermore as our first AI
  Engineer hire in the UK, you’ll also get to spearhead our
  regional expansion.
  
  Surely, we know everyone needs a little something to do
  their best work. Here is a list of some other extras we
  offer:
  
  - The chance to work remotely - as we don't have a physical
    office in the UK yet, we offer a fully remote setup for
    the time being. However, given our strong community
    emphasis, we'd expect you to spend one month in our
    Budapest hub during onboarding and visit the office for
    one week every quarter;
  
  - World-class educational benefits - there’s no shortage of
    learning opportunities at DATAPAO, meaning that you'll get
    access to Databricks' public and internal courses to learn
    all the tricks of Distributed Data Processing, MLOps,
    Apache Spark, Databricks, and Cloud Migration from the
    best. Additionally, we'll pay for various data & cloud
    certifications, you'll get dedicated time for learning
    during work hours, and access to our internal library;
  - Flexible PTO days - we’re flexible with how many days you
    take off if that does not conflict with customer success
    and the work getting done;
  - 4 weeks of paternity leave - because we think it’s important
    for both parents to be there when it matters the most;
  - Employee Assistance Program (EAP) - life always happens! And
    we'd like to be there for you when it counts the most.
    Through EAP, we offer our employees access to psychology,
    financial, and legal consulting services via phone or in
    person;
  - Pension scheme enrollment and a comprehensive private health
    insurance plan - offered via our EOR (Employer of Record)
    provider, Remote.com. Remote will be your official
    employer in the UK for the foreseeable future until we
    establish our own legal entity in the UK;
  - Top-notch working equipment - working comfortably means
    working well. You will get a MacBook Pro, a phone, and a
    sign-up bonus of 500 GBP gross (to be paid with your first
    payroll) to set up your home office or whatever else is
    needed to give your best;
  - The chance to make an impact in a high-transparency culture
    - open feedback and no politics are things we value a lot
    at DATAPAO. Additionally, you'll get the chance to work in
    the field of data & AI and shape the future of a rapidly
    growing tech company.
  
  IMPORTANT NOTE: Given that we are still sorting our ways out
  in the UK, this list will likely get an update in the
  following months, and we're also committed to growing it
  with us over time.
  
  The gross salary for this position ranges from 70.000 to
  100.000 GBP/year, depending on your assessed seniority level
  during the selection process.
  
  Please note that currently we are unable to support transfer
  or offer full sponsorship for Skilled Worker visas as we’re
  just setting foot into the UK.
