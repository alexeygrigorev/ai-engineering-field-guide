  **About PactFi**
  
  Private asset markets (PE, Private Credit, VC, Real Estate) have 10x to 9.8T in AUM over the past decade and are projected to grow to $17T in the next five years. However, digital infrastructure has not kept pace, with most of the market operating predominantly in error-prone, internal-only software solutions.
  
  PactFi provides secure, end-to-end, operational infrastructure for managing complex private credit transactions. Our web-based application brings together all parties involved in such a transaction to more efficiently allocate capital, complete KYC, share documents, manage funds flow, and more. The platform is secured to a bank-grade standard, and we have received our SOC 2 Type 2 attestation.
  
  PactFi was developed in close partnership with two of the industry's largest players, both of whom represent the top 3 players in the private credit space by both size (AUM) and deal activity.
  
  **Job Description**
  
  PactFi is seeking a **Senior Software Engineer** with a strong focus on building and evolving AI-enabled capabilities across the PactFi platform. You will remain deeply hands-on in our Laravel codebase while leading the design and implementation of AI-powered features that integrate directly into our core systems.
  
  You’ll work closely with engineering leadership, product, and business stakeholders to identify where AI creates real value, architect practical solutions, and bring them to production-without losing sight of reliability, security, scalability, and maintainability.
  
  This role is well-suited for a seasoned backend engineer who has been actively working with modern AI tooling and is ready to take on greater architectural ownership at the platform level.
  
  **Key Responsibilities:**
  
  **Backend Engineering (Core Focus)**
  
  · Design, build, and maintain robust backend systems using Laravel, with a focus on reliability, scalability, and long-term maintainability.
  
  · Develop and evolve internal services, core platform components, and shared libraries that power PactFi’s products and operations.
  
  · Collaborate with Product Managers, engineering leadership, and QA to shape technical solutions and support high-quality releases through thoughtful design, testing, debugging, and iteration.
  
  · Contribute to architectural discussions, technical standards, and platform-level improvements that support PactFi’s long-term growth.
  
  · Take initiative on internal projects and exploratory work aimed at improving developer productivity, system reliability, and operational efficiency.
  
  **AI Architecture & Implementation**
  
  - 
  
  Identify high-value AI use cases across the PactFi platform, focusing on real business impact.
  
  - 
  
  Design and implement AI-powered backend workflows, including:
  
  LLM-driven features and automations
  
  - 
  
  Intelligent agents and decision-support systems
  
  - 
  
  Automated document ingestion and extraction pipelines for large, unstructured, and semi-structured documents (e.g., PDFs, contracts, financial statements)
  
  - 
  
  Lead the integration of AI models and platforms such as OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Azure AI, Google Gemini, or similar.
  
  - 
  
  Design and implement AI workflows for inference, orchestration, evaluation, and production readiness, with attention to reliability, observability, security, and cost.
  
  - 
  
  Partner with engineering and data teams to ensure AI solutions integrate cleanly with existing systems, APIs, and data pipelines.
  
  - 
  
  Prototype and validate AI capabilities before scaling them into production.
  
  **Cross-Functional Collaboration**
  
  · Act as a technical bridge between engineering, product, and business stakeholders, guiding the design of backend systems and AI-enabled capabilities across the platform.
  
  · Work with stakeholders to evaluate requirements, constraints, and trade-offs across core backend services, data systems, and AI-driven features, ensuring solutions deliver real business value.
  
  · Contribute to shaping PactFi’s long-term platform strategy, including backend architecture, data foundations, and the thoughtful adoption of AI technologies.
  
  · Ensure technical initiatives, including AI-powered features, align with PactFi’s security, compliance, and regulatory requirements in a financial services environment.
  
  **Qualifications**
  
  -
