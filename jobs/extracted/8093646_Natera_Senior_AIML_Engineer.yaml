  Role Overview
  
  The Senior AI/ML Engineer is responsible for designing,
  building, and deploying Natera’s Generative AI and Machine
  Learning platforms. The role needs excellent hands-on
  engineering excellence to build robust, compliant, and
  efficient Generative AI and ML platform components. This
  role requires deep expertise in Generative AI and machine
  learning engineering at scale, with a passion for building
  robust, compliant, and high-performance systems that
  directly impact patient outcomes and clinical innovation.
  
  You will design, build, and scale enterprise-grade AI/ML
  systems that power internal workflows (R&D, Lab Ops,
  Clinical Trials, Billing, Patient/Provider engagement) and
  external-facing AI/ML platforms. You will design and build
  cutting-edge AI solutions leveraging agentic architecture,
  retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), vector search, feature
  stores, LLMOps, experimentation, observability, and
  compliance-first AI pipelines. You will be responsible for
  development of a production-ready Generative AI and MLOps
  platform with reusable components used to deploy multiple AI
  solutions across Natera’s business units. You will also
  develop clear standards and best practices established for
  AI/ML development across the organization.
  
  Key ResponsibilitiesPlatform Development
  
  - Design and implement foundational GenAI services: vector
    search, prompt tuning, agent orchestration, document
    extraction, context/memory services, model/endpoint
    registry, feature/embedding stores, guardrails, and
    evaluation pipelines
  - Build the underlying infrastructure for autonomous and semi-
    autonomous AI agents including support for agent
    collaboration, reasoning, and memory persistence, enabling
    continuous context-aware execution
  - Build standardized APIs/SDKs that make it easy for product
    teams to compose, deploy, and monitor Generative AI
    workloads.
  - Ensure platform components meet enterprise-grade
    requirements for scalability, latency, multi-region
    resilience, and cost efficiency
  
  Generative AI Enablement
  
  - Stand up LLM runtimes with token/rate governance, caching,
    and safe tool-use
  - Implement RAG at scale: ingestion pipelines,
    chunking/embedding policies, hybrid search, relevance/risk
    scoring, and feedback loops
  - Build agent orchestration (single & multi-agent) with
    planning, tool routing, shared/persistent memory, and
    inter-agent communication
  - Integrate tooling and APIs that allow agents to interact
    with internal systems, retrieve data securely, and take
    action under strict controls
  - Collaborate with research teams to prototype and
    productionize multi-agent architectures for workflow
    automation, report generation, and data synthesis.
  
  Infrastructure & Automation
  
  - Implement cloud-native infrastructure for large-scale model
    training and serving using Kubernetes, MLflow, Terraform,
    and AWS-native services
  - Automate data and model pipelines for RAG, LLM fine-tuning,
    and agent orchestration
  - Integrate observability tools (Datadog or equivalent) for
    real-time performance, drift detection and safety
    monitoring of AI outputs
  - Optimize compute and storage architecture to ensure cost-
    effective scaling of large models and multi-agent
    workloads
  - Partner with security, data governance, SRE, and application
    teams to productize platform capabilities
  
  Safety, Security & Compliance Integration
  
  - Embed compliance-by-design (HIPAA/CLIA/CAP/FDA/GDPR):
    PHI/PII handling, encryption, access controls, audit
    trails
  - Implement guardrails: input/output filters, prompt
    hardening, allow/deny policies for tool execution, policy-
    as-code in CI/CD
  - Bias/explainability hooks and automated evaluations for
    RAG/LLM/agents; drift and regression detection
  
  Technical Leadership & Mentorship
  
  - Establish golden paths (templates, examples, docs) and lead
    platform architecture reviews, code reviews, and design
    discussions
  - Partner with data scientists, AI researchers, and product
    engineers to deliver reliable and maintainable AI services
  - Mentor junior engineers in platform development, distributed
    systems, and agentic AI infrastructure concepts
  - Influence cross-functional roadmaps by partnering with
    Product and Engineering leadership to align delivery with
    business needs
  
  QualificationsRequired:
  
  - 8+ years in software/ML engineering, with 5+ years in ML
    engineering at scale
  - Expertise in building production-grade ML/LLM systems on AWS
    tech stack (Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Spark,
    MLflow/Kubeflow, vector DBs)
  - Proven track record with GenAI/LLMs: fine-tuning, RAG,
    prompt orchestration, agentic systems, safety guardrails,
    monitoring, and cost optimization
  - Hands-on with RAG systems (embeddings, vector DBs, retrieval
    policies) and LLM runtime operations (caching, quotas,
    multi-model routing)
  - Experience building agentic AI platforms (LangChain,
    LlamaIndex, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel, or custom)
  - Deep knowledge of data-intensive systems, distributed
    architectures, and cloud-native development
  - Strong grounding in compliance-first engineering in
    healthcare, biotech, or diagnostics preferred
  - Track record building secure, compliant data/AI systems and
    automating policy checks.
  - Excellent ability to influence across teams, mentor
    engineers, and set technical standards
  
  Preferred:
  
  - Masters degree in Computer Science, AI/ML, engineering or
    related field
  - Experience in healthcare, pharma, diagnostics, or other
    regulated industries
  - Familiarity with AI governance frameworks, bias detection,
    explainability, and compliance (e.g., HIPAA, CLIA, FDA)
  
  The pay range is listed and actual compensation packages are
  based on a wide array of factors unique to each candidate,
  including but not limited to skill set, years & depth of
  experience, certifications and specific office location.
  This may differ in other locations due to cost of labor
  considerations.
