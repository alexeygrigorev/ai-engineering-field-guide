  **Company Description**
  
  We are a Digital Product Engineering company that is scaling in a big way! We build products, services, and experiences that inspire, excite, and delight. We work at scale — across all devices and digital mediums, and our people exist everywhere in the world (18000+ experts across 37 countries, to be exact). Our work culture is dynamic and non-hierarchical. We are looking for great new colleagues. That is where you come in!
  
  **Job Description**
  
  As an Associate Distinguished Engineer – AI, Data Science & Agentic Solutions, you will act as a senior technical authority responsible for architecting, validating, and scaling next-generation AI systems across enterprises. This role is deeply hands-on with modern AI/ML ecosystems, agentic architectures, large-scale data platforms, and cloud-native engineering patterns. 
  
  Preferred locations:** Atlanta, GA & NYC, NY**
  
  **1. AI Architecture & Technical Leadership **
  
  - Architect enterprise-grade AI systems using LLMs, multimodal models, vector databases, knowledge graphs, and agentic orchestration frameworks. 
  
  - Design end-to-end pipelines including data ingestion → feature engineering → model training → evaluation → deployment → feedback loops. 
  
  - Define and enforce engineering standards for MLOps, LLMOps, data quality, model observability, guardrails, prompt security, and hallucination mitigation. 
  
  - Consult on scalable microservices, model serving layers, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, and autonomous agent workflows. 
  
  - Conduct architectural reviews, performance tuning, and technical due-diligence for high-risk or complex AI solutions. 
  
  **2. Advanced AI/ML Engineering **
  
  - Guide on how to build quick prototypes, PoCs, and production systems using modern AI stacks (transformer models, diffusion models, graph models, reinforcement learning, and agentic systems). 
  
  - Advise on selection of foundation models and fine tuning approaches. 
  
  - Advise on real-time data streams, event-driven systems, API layers, and cloud-native compute. 
  
  - Establish evaluation frameworks: bias, drift, explainability, reliability, performance. 
  
  - Lead complex troubleshooting, debugging, and optimization of AI pipelines and distributed training workloads. 
  
  **3. Data Platform & Infrastructure Architecture **
  
  - Architect secure, high-throughput data platforms for AI/BI use cases based on lakehouse, medallion, streaming, and vectorized storage patterns. 
  
  - Define data governance, metadata, lineage, cataloging, and policy enforcement mechanisms. 
  
  - Deploy scalable compute using Databricks, Snowflake, Kubernetes, Ray, SageMaker, Vertex AI, and Azure ML. 
  
  **4. Technical Advisory & Engineering Governance **
  
  - Guide CIO/CTO/CDO teams on AI system design, architecture modernization, model lifecycle governance, and platform engineering standards. 
  
  - Translate ambiguous requirements into well-scoped technical blueprints, reference architectures, and engineering backlogs. 
  
  - Evaluate enterprise readiness across data, models, infrastructure, and processes — producing AI maturity assessments and architectural recommendations. 
  
  - Mentor engineering teams in building reliable, secure, and scalable AI systems with measurable outcomes. 
  
  **5. Innovation & Ecosystem Leadership **
  
  - Lead deep-dive technical workshops on agentic systems, generative AI patterns, model safety architectures, continuous learning loops, and intelligent automation. 
  
  - Collaborate with hyperscalers and partners (AWS, Azure, GCP, Databricks, Snowflake, NVIDIA) on technical accelerators, performance benchmarks, and reference implementations. 
  
  - Stay ahead of emerging architectures (multi-agent, RAG 2.0, synthetic data generation, self-improving systems) and translate them into actionable engineering strategies. 
  
  **Qualifications**
  
  - 12+ years in AI/ML, data engineering, or large-scale distributed systems. 
  
  - Deep hands-on expertise in: 
  
  - Foundation models (LLMs, multimodal, vision, speech, embeddings) 
  
  - Model finetuning, training, inference optimization, evaluation 
  
  - MLOps/LLMOps workflows and ML engineering best practices 
  
  - Vector databases, knowledge graphs, retrieval systems 
  
  - Strong experience with cloud-native architectures (AWS, Azure, GCP) and data platforms (Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, Lakehouse). 
  
  - Demonstrated ability to design complex AI systems that operate reliably at scale. 
  
  - Experience influencing senior technology leaders through architectural clarity and technical depth. 
  
  - Strong documentation, architecture storytelling, and ability to simplify complex technical concepts for varied audiences. 
  
  - Track record of publications, open-source contributions, patents, technical talks, or recognized technical leadership is a strong plus. 
  
  **Ideal Persona**
  
  A deep technologist who: 
  
  - Operates at the intersection of AI architecture, systems engineering, and scientific rigor. 
  
  - Design AI architectures, review complex pipelines, and still communicate effectively with CTO/CDO leaders. 
  
  - Leads through engineering excellence, credibility, and technical mentorship. 
  
  - Builds systems that learn continuously, scale reliably, and deliver measurable impact.
