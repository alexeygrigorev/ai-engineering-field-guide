  ****About Coverbase****
  
  **The foundation of the modern global economy is built on a dense network of counterparty trust and risk. In the past 50 years, companies have evolved from relying on a couple of wholesalers and vendors, to utilizing 100+ SaaS vendors, contract partners, and cloud providers. Since each counterparty has their own idiosyncratic internal processes and risk profiles, businesses end up spending millions of dollars and countless man-hours conducting due diligence.
  
  **Coverbase’s mission** is to streamline this business-to-business assessment, reducing human toil, and allowing organizations to work together safely and reliably. We employ modern AI techniques to organize vast amounts of unstructured data and compare them against policies to identify key risks to the business.
  
  We already serve customers across Fortune 500 companies in insurance, higher education, and finance — including **five of the top 25 banks in the US. **
  
  **
  Our proven leadership team brings deep experience:**
  
  - 
  
  **Clarence (CEO):** Co-founder & former CTO of Unit21, a Series C fraud detection company that has raised ~$92M.
  
  - 
  
  **Kao (CTO):** Previously led the Stripe engineering team that launched Banking-as-a-Service.
  
  **We’ve raised $20M from world-class investors** and our team of 12 have built important products at Google, Mapbox and Waymo.

  We’re seeking an **AI Engineer** to develop core AI features that power an AI-native product. We’re looking for:
  
  - 
  
  Impact-driven individuals who take pride in shipping delightful products, not just exploring intellectually interesting problems.
  
  - 
  
  Teammates who care deeply about both their work and the people around them — building a culture that’s as kind as it is talented.**

  Build LLM features from ideation to production, including scaling.

  -

  Background in rigorous, quantitative work (e.g., PhD-level research, machine learning modeling, or advanced data science projects).
  
  - 
  
  Ability to thrive in a **dynamic, early-stage startup** environment. While AI is central, this is not a 100% AI role — versatility across the stack is important.
  
  - 
  
  High standards for **code quality**.**
