  ****About Particle****Particle Health is revolutionizing healthcare data analytics and interoperability. Our mission is to unlock the power of medical records in an intelligent platform that focuses health back on the patient. 
  
  Through our modern data platform, we enable healthcare innovators—ranging from value-based care providers and payers to digital health companies and health systems—to access standardized, real-time patient data. By bridging fragmented data silos, Particle empowers organizations to tackle critical use cases such as care coordination, risk stratification, patient identity management, and regulatory compliance with ease and precision.
  
  Our solutions of Snapshot, Signal, Navigator, and Workbench address the complex challenges of healthcare data analytics and interoperability, helping our customers transform data into actionable insights, improve patient outcomes, and streamline workflows.
  ****About the Role****
  
  As a Senior Software Engineer II, Backend at Particle Health, you’ll play a key technical leadership role in building, scaling, and evolving the core services that power our healthcare data platform and improve healthcare for millions of patients. You’ll work primarily in Golang (with some Python) to design and operate robust, secure, and high-performance APIs that enable customers to reliably access and utilize healthcare data at scale.
  
  Beyond owning complex backend systems, you’ll help shape how the engineering organization builds software, including advancing the team’s use of modern tooling — particularly AI-assisted development tools — to improve code quality, developer velocity, and system reliability. This role is ideal for an experienced backend engineer who pairs strong technical judgment, architectural thinking, and systems-level ownership with curiosity about improving engineering practices and outcomes.
  
  You’ll collaborate closely with Product, Data, and Engineering teammates to deliver high-quality solutions in a highly regulated, mission-driven environment, operating with meaningful ownership and influence across the backend platform. This role is best suited for engineers who have operated at a senior, staff, or technical lead level and are comfortable owning large, business-critical backend systems.
  ****Location & Work Schedule****
  
  This is a hybrid role based in New York City. The team works in-office two days per week , so applicants must be located within commuting distance and comfortable with in-person collaboration.
  ****What You'll Do****
  - Design, develop, and maintain RESTful APIs and backend services using Golang (and some Python).
  
  - Build scalable, secure, and performant services that handle healthcare data with strong privacy, security, compliance, and reliability requirements.
  
  - Leverage AI-assisted development tools to improve productivity, debugging, testing, documentation, and code quality; help define best practices and guardrails to ensure correctness, security, and maintainability
  
  - Integrate backend services with data pipelines and processing workflows.
  
  - Take end-to-end ownership of complex systems, including architecture, implementation, observability, operational health, and long-term reliability
  
  - Lead or meaningfully contribute to architectural discussions and long-term technical planning, balancing near-term delivery with long-term platform health
  
  - Identify and implement measurable improvements to system performance, efficiency, scalability, and reliability
  
  - Mentor engineers and contribute to improving engineering standards, tooling, and development practices.
  
  - Partner closely with Product to translate requirements into durable technical solutions, including supporting customer integrations and production use cases
  ****What We Seek********Required:****
  - 8+ years of backend engineering experience, with sustained focus on APIs and distributed systems in production environments
  
  - Strong production experience with Golang; comfortable working in Python when needed.
  
  - Significant experience using AI-assisted development tools (e.g., Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code) to implement features, improve engineering workflows, with sound judgment around quality, risk and maintainability.
  
  - Deep understanding of RESTful API design, scalable service patterns, and backend architecture.
  
  - Experience with SQL and/or NoSQL databases and cloud environments (ideally GCP).
  
  - Demonstrated ability to** **design, build, evolve, and operate complex systems independently, including making architectural tradeoffs
  
  - Strong debugging, analytical, and communication skills.
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or equivalent practical experience.
  ****Nice to Have:****
  - Experience with healthcare data standards (FHIR, HL7, CCDA).
  
  - Familiarity with data engineering pipelines or ETL workflows.
  
  - Hands-on experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and modern CI/CD tooling.
  
  - Experience working in GCP.
  
  - Infrastructure-as-Code experience, particularly Terraform.
  
  - Experience with event-driven architectures and message queues.
  
  - Knowledge of API security patterns (OAuth, JWT).
  
  - Familiarity with healthcare compliance frameworks (HIPAA, SOC 2).
  
  - Experience helping define best practices or internal standards for AI-assisted development.
  ****What You Bring:****
  - A passion for building reliable, well-designed APIs and backend systems
  
  - Enthusiasm for using AI developer tools thoughtfully to deliver business impact
  
  - Strong attention to detail and commitment to code quality and operational excellence
