  ****About the role****
  
  Hex is an AI-powered platform for modern Data Science and Data Analytics workflows. AI Engineers at Hex partner with product teams to build industry-leading AI experiences such as the Notebook Agent. In the process, AI Engineers will run experiments, fine-tune models, deploy AI infrastructure, and build and maintain experimentation tooling. **As the AI Engineer partnered with Hex's Curator team (located in our New York office), your focus will be driving Hex's context engine. Whether its pushing the frontiers of SQL generation quality or using LLMs to evaluate agent threads, your job will be to enable the data teams that work in Hex to build out highly accurate and curated data experiences for *their *stakeholders, unlocking the power of data driven decisions for the rest of the business.
  If you’re a strong builder excited to bring these capabilities to thousands of users, come do it on the best Data Science platform around, with the best user context.
  
  We are looking for a senior engineer (from an AI Eng, SWE or MLE background) eager to rapidly expand our capabilities in several greenfield applications. As one of our team’s early hires, you will work on a variety of initiatives including:
  
  - Building features and experiences from 0 to 1
  
  - Partnering on determining the architecture and stack for our AI-enabled capabilities
  
  - Shipping product experiences that fundamentally change the way that Data Scientists and Analysts operate
  
  - Working at the cutting edge of production AI applications
  
  This type of ownership will provide incredible opportunities for personal and professional growth. You will have ample technical and team leadership opportunities, depending on your interests.
  
  We aim to deliver AI capabilities that radically accelerate and augment the data science workflow – we’ve got an exciting roadmap and are willing to share more details during the process. We’re particularly interested in candidates who bring inspired excitement about what is possible in this space.
  
  **Note:** We deeply respect and appreciate deep AI/ML research; this role is not that. While experience producing relevant journal publications is awesome, it won’t be part of this role’s deliverables.
  **We'd love to hear from you if you have:****
  - Experience getting AI/ML capabilities into production and serving real users – we’re not currently looking for new grad folks.
  
  - A lot of enthusiasm for applications of AI to real business problems.
  
  - Understanding of core MLOps/SW Architecture concepts for modern ML-based applications.
  Ideal candidates are strong on Infra aspects of MLOps as well.
  
  - You’re comfortable working in both Python & JS/TS – it’s okay if you’re only strong in one, but openness to both is important.
  
  - Experimentalist mindset – understanding that quick iteration, and discerning critical thinking, can yield rapid progress on new challenges.
  
  - Interest in the data space, and a love of shipping great products and building tools that empower end users to do more.
  
  - Experience maintaining a high quality bar for design, correctness, and testing.
  
  *This is a full-time role based out of our New York office. Employees are encouraged to come into the office at least twice a week, with Tuesdays and Thursdays being our main in-person days.*
  
  In addition to our unique culture, Hex proudly offers a competitive total rewards package, including but not limited to, market-benched salary & equity, comprehensive health benefits, and flexible paid time off.
  
  The salary range for this role is: $180,000 - $270,000
  
  The salary range shown may be a reflection of additional factors such as geographical location and skill ranges/levels we’re open to. Placement in the salary range will be decided upon completion of the interview process, taking into account factors like leaving room for growth, internal fairness & parity, your demonstrated skills, and the depth of your experience. Our Recruiting team will be able to provide more details during the interview process.
