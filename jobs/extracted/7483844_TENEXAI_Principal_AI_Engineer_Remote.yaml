  ****Company Overview****
  
  TENEX is an AI-native, automation-first, built-for-scale Managed Detection and Response (MDR) provider. We are a force multiplier for defenders, helping organizations enhance their cybersecurity posture through advanced threat detection, rapid response, and continuous protection. Our team is composed of industry experts with deep experience in cybersecurity, automation, and AI-driven solutions. Backed by leading investors, we are rapidly growing and seeking top talent to join our mission of revolutionizing the MDR landscape.
  
  As a **Principal AI Engineer** at TENEX, you will be a key technical leader responsible for designing, developing, and optimizing scalable, high-performance AI systems. You will play a crucial role in shaping the architecture of our AI-driven cybersecurity solutions while mentoring engineering teams and driving technical innovation.
  
  Culture is one of the most important things at TENEX.AI—check out our culture deck at culture.tenex.ai to experience how we champion it, valuing the unmatched collaboration and community of in-person work while offering flexibility for the best of the best.
  
  This role is for the extraordinary—the pinnacle 10x of 10x legends in any role— where we make exceptions to our in-person hiring to champion full remote freedom, empowering you to conquer without boundaries while still inviting you to join our in-person energy from time to time.
  
  To be direct up front - If you’re looking at this position, we strongly recommend you consider accepting one of our lucrative relocation packages to our epic hubs in Sarasota, Florida (outside Tampa), or Overland Park in the Kansas City metro—where trailblazers redefine cybersecurity with 10x impact!
  
  In Florida, you can break free from overly inflated cost of living sky-high taxes (like those of you trapped in California or New York) via our incredibly aggressive relocation packages, enjoying zero state income tax, boundless personal freedom, a pro-business surge, endless sunshine, and a pro-family haven in the master-planned Lakewood Ranch with elite amenities and vibes. In KC, leverage those same powerhouse relocation perks for lower taxes, authentic Midwest values of integrity and community, and a supportive, family-oriented ecosystem for enduring wins. See those respective listings with more details on our careers page.
  
  For candidates who embody the rare "10x of 10x" talent, we offer the flexibility of fully remote work. If you are an exceptional, unrivaled force in this role and prefer not to relocate at this time, we encourage you to apply for this remote-first position. Please be aware that the competition for these remote roles is exceptionally fierce, and the standards for selection are significantly higher.
