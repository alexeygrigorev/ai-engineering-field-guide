  With WRITER's end-to-end platform, hundreds of companies
  like Mars, Marriott, Uber, and Vanguard are building and
  deploying AI agents that are grounded in their company's
  data and fueled by WRITER's enterprise-grade LLMs. Valued at
  $1.9B and backed by industry-leading investors including
  Premji Invest, Radical Ventures, and ICONIQ Growth, WRITER
  is rapidly cementing its position as the leader in
  enterprise generative AI.
  
  Founded in 2020 with office hubs in San Francisco, New York
  City, Austin, Chicago, and London, our team thinks big and
  moves fast, and we're looking for smart, hardworking
  builders and scalers to join us on our journey to create a
  better future of work with AI.
  
  📐 About the role
  
  We're looking for an exceptional software engineer,
  generative AI to join our rapidly evolving team at WRITER.
  In this pivotal role, you'll be at the forefront of
  expanding human capacity by building the next generation of
  AI-powered solutions that transform how leading enterprises
  operate. You'll dive deep into developing a state-of-the-art
  platform that leverages cutting-edge generative AI
  technologies, from large language models to sophisticated
  agentic workflows, delivering seamless, scalable, and secure
  applications that redefine enterprise productivity. This is
  an unparalleled opportunity to make a tangible impact,
  shaping the future of AI and contributing to a product
  that’s changing how the world works.
  
  This role is hybrid, based out of our San Francisco, New
  York City, or London hubs. You'll report to an engineering
  director or a senior engineering manager.
  
  🦸🏻‍♀️ What you'll do
  
  - Design and develop robust, scalable, and secure generative
    AI services and applications using Python and modern
    frameworks to drive enterprise-wide transformation
  - Build and optimize high-performance, low-latency APIs and
    microservices for integrating advanced AI models and
    agentic workflows into our platform
  - Collaborate closely with product managers, data scientists,
    and cross-functional engineering teams to translate
    complex business needs into innovative AI solutions, from
    concept to production
  - Implement and maintain responsive user interfaces (primarily
    focused on backend enablement though some frontend
    interaction is expected) using technologies like React and
    TypeScript to deliver intuitive user experiences
  - Partner with DevOps teams building continuous deployment,
    logging and monitoring; ensuring top-tier performance and
    reliability
  - Own key architectural components, ensuring best practices in
    code quality, security, and maintainability through
    rigorous testing and peer reviews
  
  ⭐️ What you need
  
  - 3+ years of hands-on experience as a software engineer, with
    a strong emphasis on Python development in production
    environments. We are open to discussing seniority levels
    from Senior to Staff.
  - Proven expertise in building and deploying generative AI
    applications, leveraging LLMs, vector databases (e.g.,
    Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector), and modern open source
    agentic Frameworks.
  - Deep understanding and practical experience with
    microservices architecture, RESTful APIs, and cloud
    platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Azure, including
    containerization with Docker and Kubernetes
  - Solid grasp of modern web technologies including FastAPI,
    Asyncio, and database systems like PostgreSQL
  - A "Connect" mindset, thriving in collaborative settings
    where you actively engage with cross-functional teams and
    mentor junior engineers to achieve shared goals
  - A "Challenge" spirit, demonstrating exceptional problem-
    solving skills to tackle complex technical hurdles and
    proactively suggest innovative improvements to our systems
    and processes
  - An "Own" attitude, taking full accountability for delivering
    high-quality, resilient, and scalable code from conception
    through to production, continuously driving performance
    and maintainability
