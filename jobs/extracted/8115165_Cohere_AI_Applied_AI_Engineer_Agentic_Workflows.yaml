  Who are we?
  
  Our mission is to scale intelligence to serve humanity.
  We’re training and deploying frontier models for developers
  and enterprises who are building AI systems to power magical
  experiences like content generation, semantic search, RAG,
  and agents. We believe that our work is instrumental to the
  widespread adoption of AI.
  
  We obsess over what we build. Each one of us is responsible
  for contributing to increasing the capabilities of our
  models and the value they drive for our customers. We like
  to work hard and move fast to do what’s best for our
  customers.
  
  Cohere is a team of researchers, engineers, designers, and
  more, who are passionate about their craft. Each person is
  one of the best in the world at what they do. We believe
  that a diverse range of perspectives is a requirement for
  building great products.
  
  Join us on our mission and shape the future!
  
  Why this role?
  
  We’re a fast-growing startup building production-grade AI
  agents for enterprise customers at scale. We’re looking for
  Applied AI Engineers who can own the design, build, and
  deployment of agentic workflows powered by Large Language
  Models (LLMs)—from early prototypes to production-grade AI
  agents, to deliver concrete business value in enterprise
  workflows.
  
  In this role, you’ll work closely with customers on real-
  world business problems, often building first-of-their-kind
  agent workflows that integrate LLMs with tools, APIs, and
  data sources. While our pace is startup-fast, the bar is
  enterprise-high: agents must be reliable, observable, safe,
  and auditable from day one.
  
  You’ll collaborate closely with customers, product, and
  platform teams, and help shape how agentic systems are
  built, evaluated, and deployed at scale.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Work with enterprise customers and internal teams to turn
    business workflows into scalable, production-ready agentic
    AI systems.
  - Design and build LLM-powered agents that reason, plan, and
    act across tools and data sources with enterprise-grade
    reliability.
  - Balance rapid iteration with enterprise requirements,
    evolving prototypes into stable, reusable solutions.
  - Define and apply evaluation and quality standards to measure
    success, failures, and regressions.
  - Debug real-world agent behavior and systematically improve
    prompts, workflows, tools, and guardrails.
  - Contribute to shared frameworks and patterns that enable
    consistent delivery across customers.
  
  Required Skills & Experience
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or a related technical
    field.
  - Strong programming skills in Python and/or
    JavaScript/TypeScript.
  - 3+ years of experience building and shipping production
    software; 2+ years working with LLMs or AI APIs.
  - Hands-on experience with modern LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude,
    Gemini), vector databases, and agent/orchestration
    frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, or
    custom solutions).
  - Practical experience with RAG, agent workflows, evaluation,
    and performance optimization.
  - Strong agent design skills, including prompt engineering,
    tool use, multi-step agent workflows (e.g. ReAct), and
    failure handling.
  - Ability to reason about and balance trade-offs between
    customization and reuse, as well as autonomy, control,
    cost, latency, and risk.
  - Strong communication skills and experience leading technical
    discussions with customers or partners.
  
  Nice-to-Have
  
  - Experience working in a fast-moving startup environment.
  - Prior work delivering AI or automation solutions to
    enterprise customers.
  - Familiarity with human-in-the-loop workflows, fine-tuning,
    or LLM evaluation techniques.
  - Experience with cloud deployment and production operations
    for AI systems.
  - Background in applied ML, NLP, or decision systems.
  
  Additional Requirements
  
  - Strong written and verbal communication skills.
  - Ability and interest to travel up to 25%, flexible.
  
  Why Join Us
  
  - Build production-grade AI agents used in real enterprise
    workflows.
  - Operate at scale while retaining end-to-end ownership.
  - Work on hard problems in agent design, evaluation, and
    reliability.
  - Shape shared platforms and standards, not just individual
    features.
  - Move fast with a high bar for quality, safety, and
    reliability.
