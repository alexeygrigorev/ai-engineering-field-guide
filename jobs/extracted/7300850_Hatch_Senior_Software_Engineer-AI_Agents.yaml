  **About Hatch**
  At Hatch, we’re revolutionizing customer service with AI that doesn’t just assist — it transforms how businesses engage with customers. Backed by Y Combinator and top-tier investors like Bessemer Venture Partners and NextView Ventures, we’re doubling revenue year over year and scaling rapidly. We’re building the future of AI-driven customer service — and we’re just getting started.
  
  **Role- Senior Software Engineer -AI Agents Team**
  
  As a Staff Engineer, you’ll join a team that’s pushing the boundaries of AI, systems design, and user experience. This role is for builders who think at scale, lead by example, and thrive in a fast-paced, high-growth environment.
  
  **About the Role**
  We’re looking for a **Senior Full-Stack Engineer** to lead end-to-end delivery of user-facing experiences and the services that power them. You’ll move fluidly between **React/TypeScript** on the web and backend APIs/data models, setting technical direction and shipping features that materially move the business. You’ll partner closely with product and design, make smart tradeoffs, and raise the bar for code quality and developer experience across the stack.Key Responsibilities
  
  - 
  
  **Own end-to-end features**: Design, build, and ship user-facing functionality spanning React web applications, backend APIs, and databases.
  
  - 
  
  **Build robust backend services**: Develop APIs and services that are reliable, well-structured, and easy for other engineers to extend.
  
  - 
  
  **Elevate the web experience**: Implement clean, maintainable React components and patterns that support usability, accessibility, and long-term velocity.
  
  - 
  
  **Design data models**: Create intuitive schemas and query patterns that serve both product needs and developer productivity.
  
  - 
  
  **Set technical direction**: Define conventions and make architectural decisions that balance speed, quality, and maintainability across the stack.
  
  - 
  
  **Mentor and coach**: Support engineers working in both backend and frontend areas, growing full-stack fluency and technical ownership.
  
  **What We’re Looking For**
  
  - 
  
  **5+ years of professional software engineering experience**
  
  - 
  
  **Deep expertise in backend programming languages** (e.g., Elixir, Go, Java, Python); experience with functional programming is a plus.
  
  - 
  
  **Strong experience with React and modern JavaScript/TypeScript**, including building and maintaining complex web applications.
  
  - 
  
  **Solid understanding of relational and non-relational databases** (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis) and data architecture.
  
  - 
  
  **Comfortable moving across the stack** — from data models and APIs to React components — to deliver end-to-end features.
  
  - 
  
  **Experience collaborating with DevOps and infrastructure teams** on deployment, monitoring, and cloud environments.
  
  - 
  
  **Excellent collaboration and communication skills** — you bring others along and elevate those around you.
  
  - 
  
  **Product-oriented mindset** — you care deeply about building systems that meet real user needs.
  
  - 
  
  **Experience mentoring engineers and leading technical projects.**
  
  **Nice to Have**
  
  - 
  
  Experience working in a fast-growing startup environment.
  
  - 
  
  Contributions to open source or active participation in engineering communities.
  
  **What We Offer**
  
  - 
  
  Competitive salary and equity
  
  - 
  
  Remote OR Hybrid work environment (3 days/week in our NYC office)
  
  -

  - 
  
  401(k) plan
  
  - 
  
  Flexible PTO
  
  - 
  
  Opportunity to build at the ground floor of a high-growth, mission-driven company
  
  - 
  
  Not offering sponsorship
