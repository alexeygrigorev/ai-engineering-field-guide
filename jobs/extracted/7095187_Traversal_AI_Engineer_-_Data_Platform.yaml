  About Traversal
  
  Traversal is the AI Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) for the
  enterprise—already trusted by some of the largest companies
  in the world to troubleshoot, remediate, and even prevent
  the most complex production incidents. Our mission is to
  free engineers from endless firefighting and enable them to
  focus on creative, high-impact work.
  
  Our roots remain deeply embedded in AI research, and we’re
  channeling that scientific rigor and creativity into
  building the premier AI agent lab for the enterprise. Hence,
  what we’re proudest of is assembling the most talented yet
  nicest group of individuals, including researchers from MIT,
  Harvard, and Berkeley, to world-class engineers from
  industry: Citadel Securities, Cockroach Labs, Datadog, DE
  Shaw, ServiceNow, Glean, Perplexity, Pinecone, and more, to
  take on one of the hardest problems for AI to solve. Without
  the entire team, none of this would be possible.
  
  The Role
  
  As an Infrastructure Engineer on the Data Platform team at
  Traversal, you’ll design, build, and maintain the backend
  systems that power our AI-driven observability platform.
  You’ll work across both cloud and on-prem deployments,
  ensuring our systems are highly reliable, performant, and
  capable of supporting large-scale AI operations. This hands-
  on role blends distributed systems engineering, low-level
  system design, performance optimization, observability, and
  AI integration—collaborating closely with engineers across
  the company to deliver resilient infrastructure that enables
  our AI agents to diagnose and remediate production incidents
  in real time.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Architecture & Implementation: Contribute to the design and
    implementation of scalable, resilient infrastructure
    systems that power AI-driven root cause analysis and
    observability workflows across diverse on-premises
    environments.
  - Low-Level System Design: Work on the foundational building
    blocks of our infrastructure, ensuring efficient use of
    resources and high performance at scale.Performance
    Optimization: Profile and tune backend systems to improve
    throughput, reduce latency, and minimize bottlenecks
    across the stack.
  - Observability Systems: Help build and maintain the internal
    observability stack—logs, metrics, and traces—used by our
    agents to understand and act on production issues.
  - Hybrid Infrastructure: Support architectures for both cloud-
    hosted (SaaS) and on-prem deployments to serve enterprise
    customers.
  - Data Infrastructure: Develop and maintain low-latency, high-
    throughput pipelines using tools like Kafka, Postgres, and
    S3 for real-time telemetry workflows.
  - Tooling & Automation: Contribute to infrastructure-as-code,
    CI/CD tooling, and deployment systems to increase platform
    velocity and stability.
  - Cross-Team Collaboration: Work with AI, platform, and
    product teams to ensure smooth integration and shared
    reliability goals.
  - Using Traversal Internally: Help ensure our own
    observability tooling supports how we debug, monitor, and
    operate our systems.
  
  Requirements
  
  - Professional experience with Rust (our primary language for
    infrastructure), or strong systems-level programming
    experience in OCaml, C++, C or Zig.
  - Experience building distributed systems using a variety of
    application-appropriate datastores (e.g., Postgres, object
    storage, etc.).
  - Strength in debugging across cloud infrastructure,
    networking layers, and production systems
    (instrumentation, provisioning, bug fixes, reliability
    improvements).
  - Experience with performance profiling and optimization in
    backend systems.
  - Exposure to low-level system design concepts (e.g.,
    concurrency models, storage internals, OS, and DB level
    tuning).
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Experience making complex software systems observable using
    logs, metrics, and traces.
  - Familiarity with Python-based ecosystems.
  - Background in large-scale, complex, data-driven
    applications, and familiarity with event streaming
    platforms such as Kafka.
  - Experience provisioning and managing infrastructure using
    Terraform, Pulumi, or other IaC tools.
  - Familiarity with AI or LLM-powered products.
