  **Summary****
  
  As a Senior AI Developer, you will design, develop, and maintain secure and scalable Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers that expose external capabilities to AI assistants. You will create and integrate tools that enable AI agents particularly those deployed through Azure AI Foundry to interact with external systems, databases, and APIs. This role combines deep technical expertise in cloud infrastructure, AI tool design, and system security to empower next-generation AI-driven solutions for internal and client-facing applications.
  
  **
  
  **Responsibilities****
  
  - Design, develop, and maintain MCP servers that expose external tools and capabilities to AI assistants.
  
  - Implement specific MCP tools (functions) for reading files, managing issues, interacting with databases, or triggering complex workflows.
  
  - Define and structure resources, schemas, and prompts accessible to AI agents.
  
  - Ensure security and access control for the MCP server, limiting which tools and data agents can execute or access.
  
  - Manage API integrations and external data sources used by MCP tools.
  
  - Use JSON Schema or similar standards to document and validate tool definitions.
  
  - Integrate MCP Server tools with Azure AI Foundry agents, enabling AI agents to perform actions such as data querying, workflow automation, and API interaction.
  
  - Collaborate with product managers and front-end teams to integrate AI capabilities into user-facing platforms (e.g., Microsoft Copilot, VS Code extensions, or web portals).
  
  - Utilize Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, and Azure Cognitive Services to connect MCP-based AI workflows to enterprise systems.
  
  - Develop and manage tools that interface with Azure resources (e.g., Azure Storage, Azure SQL, Azure Compute Services) through the MCP Server.
  
  - Enable AI agents to securely manage, retrieve, and utilize Azure resources.
  
  - Apply best practices in cloud security, authentication, and API permissions management.
  
  - Conduct comprehensive testing and debugging of MCP tools and Azure integrations.
  
  - Create detailed documentation for MCP tools, including usage examples, API specifications, and integration guides.
  
  - Ensure scalability, performance, and reliability of MCP and AI Foundry deployments.
  
  - Partner with AI engineers, cloud architects, and data scientists to align tool development with strategic goals.
  
  - Present technical solutions and architectural decisions to stakeholders in clear, actionable terms.
  
  - Contribute to the AI governance framework, ensuring responsible AI tool design and usage.
