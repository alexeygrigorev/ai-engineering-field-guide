  **AI Engineer, Email**
  
  The Technology & Engineering department at Future offers a collaborative, collegiate environment focused on delivering, well-engineered, and scalable solutions. We look to answer critical challenges posed both by our product and commercial teams and from within the department.
  **What you'll do**
  
  Your mission is to bring intelligence to our email marketing by optimising and integrating **Advisor**, Future's proprietary AI recommendation engine. You will ensure that every email we send—whether a newsletter or a marketing trigger—contains hyper-personalised content tailored to the individual user's interests and behaviours.
  
  You will report into the Tech lead, and work alongside our Full Stack Developers and Data Engineers to bridge the gap between our **Single Customer View (SCV)** data and the final email content, enabling "Next Best Action" decision-making at scale.
  **Experience that will put you ahead of the curve**
  - **AI/ML Engineering:** Background in building and deploying machine learning models, specifically **recommender systems** (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering) or personalization engines.
  
  - **Python Proficiency:** Expert-level Python skills for data manipulation (Pandas, NumPy) and model development (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch).
  
  - **Data Engineering Awareness:** Comfort working with large datasets and data pipelines, understanding how to query and feature-engineer from data warehouses (e.g., **BigQuery**).
  
  - **API Development:** Ability to wrap models in performant APIs (FastAPI/Flask) for real-time inference during email assembly.
  
  - **MarTech Context:** Understanding of marketing KPIs (Open Rate, CTR, Conversion) and how AI can directly impact them.
  
  - **Cloud Experience:** Familiarity with deploying ML services on cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure).
  **What's in it for you**
  
  The expected range for this role is £60,000 - £65,000
  
  This is a UK, Remote-based role
  
  … Plus more great perks, which include;
  
  - Uncapped leave, because we trust you to manage your workload and time
  
  - When we hit our targets, enjoy a share of our profits with a bonus
  
  - Refer a friend and get rewarded when they join Future
  
  - Well-being support with access to our Colleague Assistant Programmes
  
  - Opportunity to purchase shares in Future, with our Share Incentive Plan
  
  Internal job family level T6
