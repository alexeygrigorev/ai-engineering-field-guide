  EvolutionaryScale, now part of CZI Biohub, is pioneering the next era of AI-powered biology to understand and program life at scale. Together, we’re combining frontier artificial intelligence and frontier biology and building the technology to study how cells operate, organize, and work as part of systems to understand why disease happens and how to correct it. Our mission is to unlock new scientific discoveries that will help cure or prevent disease. Backed by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), Biohub operates as a nonprofit organization uniting leading scientists, engineers, and technologists across hubs based in California, New York, and Chicago.
  
  In 2025, Biohub welcomed the EvolutionaryScale team - recognized for creating large-scale frontier AI systems for the life sciences - to accelerate the mission. Led by co-founder Alex Rives, who now serves as Head of Science at Biohub, the integrated organization is scaling up the compute and research infrastructure needed to build next-generation models of biology-powered by the largest cluster dedicated to open science.
  
  We are at a pivotal moment in science offering a world-class interdisciplinary research environment across biology, data, and artificial intelligence and we will continue to hire for exceptional talent across these disciplines.
  
  We are excited to strengthen in-person connections and cultivate a collaborative, team-oriented environment. This role is a hybrid position requiring you to be onsite for at least 60% of the working month, approximately 3 days a week.
