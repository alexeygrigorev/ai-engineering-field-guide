  THE OPPORTUNITY
  
  We are building the #1 AI learning companion for 1 billion
  students globally.
  
  We are building a future where every student on the planet
  can access, enjoy, and benefit from the highest quality
  education. Since founding Knowunity straight out of high
  school in 2020, we've been committed to revolutionising how
  students learn.
  
  Millions of students already use our AI learning companion
  weekly. We just raised €27m - Europe’s largest education
  round in the past three years. The AI learning market is at
  an inflection point, finally enabling true personalisation
  at scale, and we're determined to build the first AI
  learning unicorn in this space.
  
  You will join an elite team of 60 hands-on builders serving
  1 billion students worldwide. If we execute on our product
  vision, you will have built something generational that
  transforms education globally.
  
  This is your chance to be part of building a generational
  company.
  
  YOUR MISSION
  
  You have the opportunity to shape how students learn in the
  future Engineering is at the core of the company, it really
  drives knowunity, main character, you can end to end own
  this revolution yourself across parts such as:
  
  - Videos
  - First ones that build video on large scale truly
    personalised
  - Topic prediction, real guidance / personalisation as biggest
    opportunity in AI
  - Holy grail is personalisation and guidance, we have a lot of
    data, you can crack that
  - Future of practice, quizlet is outdated, practice in future
    needs to be more guided and diverse
  - Multi-Modality of outputs
  - We do not believe in wall of text, we are building cards,
    graphs, interactive practice elements in the chat - no one
    has solved this yet
  - New ways of learning of Gen Alpha
  - Figure out how this generation learns
  - In a world of personal AI companions, there will still be in
    person learning and interaction, how can an AI companion
    include social use cases and still bring students together
  - Ability to ship A/B tests to millions of users quicklyYour
    ownership:
  
  - Own and build end-to-end AI products that deliver measurable
    value to students across our global user base.
  - Drive technical decisions that align with product impact -
    choosing the right tools, models, and approaches to move
    key metrics like DAU and retention.
  - Translate product ideas into real features by collaborating
    cross-functionally and contributing actively to product
    strategy.
  
  Why this matters: Every AI feature you build gets shipped
  fast and used by real students - meaning your work has an
  immediate and measurable effect on learning outcomes, user
  growth, and product-market fit. You’ll be directly
  accelerating our core business metrics and impact on
  students worldwide. What success looks like: You’ll ship
  meaningful AI-driven features quickly and iterate based on
  real usage data. Your technical contributions will be
  visible in the metrics, boosting usage, retention, and
  engagement. You’ll help shape a product that students rely
  on every day, while growing your skills in a team that
  values speed, autonomy, and ownership. Over time, you’ll be
  known for building solutions that are not only technically
  sound, but that truly matter to our mission.
  
  Our Tech Stack Our app is written in Flutter with Riverpod.
  Our Golang backend is powered by PostgreSQL and hosted on
  AWS with Kubernetes. Our AI stack consists of several LLM
  providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, and Mistral), custom
  routing engines, and fine-tuned models. Our data stack
  consists of BigQuery and dbt.
  
  WHO YOU ARE
  
  Your mindset You’re the type of person who:
  
  - Thinks in prompts and systems - you know how to speak the
    language of LLMs and can make them do what others can’t
  - Builds to ship - you love moving fast, testing ideas in
    code, and iterating quickly based on real feedback
  - Serves the user, not the process - you focus relentlessly on
    impact, not bureaucracy
  - Thrives in ambiguity - when priorities shift, you don’t
    stall—you adapt and move
  - Leverages AI - as a force multiplier in everything you do
  - Values excellence over comfort - mediocrity isn’t in your
    vocabulary
  
  Your track record You’ve worked hands-on with large language
  models, tuning prompts, integrating APIs, building
  prototypes, and pushing performance. You’ve shipped code in
  real-world products and know how to balance speed with
  quality. You’ve helped turn messy ideas into useful features
  that delight users and scale with smart engineering. Must-
