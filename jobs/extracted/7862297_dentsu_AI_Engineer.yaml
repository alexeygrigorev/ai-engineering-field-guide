  **Job Description:**
  
  *Ready to build the future of marketing with AI? We're looking for an AI Marketing Engineer who's passionate about automation, enjoys working with APIs, and gets excited about turning innovative ideas into practical solutions. You'll be instrumental in making AI truly valuable for our teams - developing tools that streamline workflows, automate routine tasks, and unlock new creative possibilities.*
  
  This role offers the opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI projects that directly impact our business operations. You'll collaborate with teams across operations, strategy, and technology to implement practical AI solutions. While not every project will succeed, those that do will become essential tools that transform our workflows.
  
  You'll report to our Software Development Director and work within a supportive environment that values innovation and practical problem-solving.
  
  **What You'll Do**
  
  - Build GenAI apps (briefing assistants, classifiers, creative generation tools) from prototype to production.
  
  - Design and optimize prompts, fine-tune models when needed, and ensure reliable outputs.
  
  - Create automation pipelines with tools like n8n, Make, Zapier, and Copilot Studio.
  
  - Integrate AI models with our martech stack through APIs, webhooks, and custom scripts.
  
  - Monitor outputs, implement guardrails for brand safety, and ensure compliance.
  
  - Debug, document, and continuously improve solutions.
  
  **Build Innovative Solutions**
  
  You'll create GenAI applications that solve real business challenges, including intelligent briefing assistants, content classifiers, and creative generation tools. Your work involves engineering prompts that actually deliver results, fine-tuning models when needed, and deliver reliable outputs. You'll turn proof-of-concepts into production-ready solutions that teams can rely on.
  
  **Automation & Integration****Master workflow tools like n8n, Make, Zapier, and Copilot Studio to connect systems that were never meant to talk to each other. You'll build automation pipelines that make repetitive tasks disappear, create seamless integrations between AI models and our existing martech stack, and prototype rapidly while iterating based on user feedback.
  
  Deliver Quality Products**
  
  Monitor AI outputs and implement guardrails for brand safety while ensuring models stay on-brand and compliant with data regulations. When things break (because they will), you'll debug and optimize for performance, documenting your work so others can build on your innovations.
  
  **What We're Looking For**
  
  Practical skills matter more than degrees. Curiosity and learning ability outweigh credentials.
  
  - Strong Python coding skills and proven experience delivering functional tools.
  
  - Hands-on with OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, open-source LLMs, and workflow automation platforms.
  
  - Solid understanding of LLM capabilities/limitations and integration best practices.
  
  - Comfortable with APIs, data integration, and version control.
  
  - Problem-solver with self-directed learning ability and clear communication skills.
  
  - 3 - 5 years working in a relevant technical environment
  
  Nice to Have:
  
  - Portfolio, open-source contributions, or personal AI/automation projects.
  
  - Understanding of marketing/advertising workflows.
  
  - Active in AI communities, curious about emerging tech, and eager to improve processes.
  
  **Why You'll Love It Here**
  
  - **Meaningful Impact**
  
  Your tools will be used by hundreds of specialists and strategists daily, giving you a direct impact on how one of the world's largest agency networks operates. You'll have access to dentsu's global AI initiatives and cutting-edge projects, with opportunities to experiment on a daily basis with the latest tools and models.
  
  - **Work Environment**
  
  Work with people who actually understand what you're building in a hybrid setup where you come to our Amsterdam office when it makes sense and work from home when it doesn't.
  
  **What We Offer**
  
  - Competitive salary that reflects your technical expertise;
  
  - 25 vacation days + 3 wellbeing days + 2 volunteer days;
  
  - Regular hackathons and innovation time;
  
  - Modern tech stack and development tools.
  
  **Apply**
  
  If you're someone who has strong convictions about effective prompt engineering and AI implementation, gets excited about new model releases and their potential applications, and wants to work at a company that takes AI seriously and implements it thoughtfully, we'd like to hear from you.
  
  **Please submit:**
  
  - Your CV highlighting relevant technical experience;
  
  - Portfolio or GitHub showcasing AI/automation projects you've built;
  
  - Brief description of the most interesting AI tool or automation you've created;
  
  - Your thoughts on where most companies go wrong with AI implementation.
