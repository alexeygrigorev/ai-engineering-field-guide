  **About Us**
  
  Automation Anywhere is the leader in Agentic Process Automation (APA), transforming how work gets done with AI-powered automation. Its APA system, built on the industry’s first Process Reasoning Engine (PRE) and specialized AI agents, combines process discovery, RPA, end-to-end orchestration, document processing, and analytics—all delivered with enterprise-grade security and governance. Guided by its vision to fuel the future of work, Automation Anywhere helps organizations worldwide boost productivity, accelerate growth, and unleash human potential.
  
  **Our Opportunity**
