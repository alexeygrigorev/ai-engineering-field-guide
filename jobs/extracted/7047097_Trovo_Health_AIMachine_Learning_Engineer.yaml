  **About us:**
  
  Trovo Health is building the AI-powered care team platform for infinitely scalable clinical capacity. We radically increase access and improve quality of care by combining AI agents with clinical experts to take on high-impact clinical operations and care management activities for healthcare organizations.
  
  We’re growing rapidly and are backed by Oak HC/FT, investors in leading healthcare and technology companies such as Ambience Healthcare, Devoted Health, VillageMD, CareBridge, Main Street Health, Maven Clinic, and more.
  
  **About the Role:**
  
  We are looking for a highly capable AI / ML Engineer to help build and scale Trovo Health’s AI Care Team platform. This is a broad-scope, hands-on engineering role for a technical builder with strong ML fundamentals, production experience, and a product-oriented mindset. As an early member of the engineering team, you will play a critical role in designing, training, deploying, and operating the ML systems that power Trovo’s AI coordinator.
  
  **Responsibilities:**
  
  - **Build and own AI systems end-to-end:** Ingest, structure, and analyze large volumes of unstructured healthcare data, and design production-grade data and ML pipelines for both training and inference.
  
  - **Develop NLP and LLM-powered features:** Design, evaluate, and deploy models using modern NLP frameworks and LLM APIs, with a strong focus on real-world performance and reliability.
  
  - **Operate at production scale:** Architect and maintain cloud-based ML workflows in AWS, including containerized services and orchestration for data processing, training, and inference.
  
  - **Continuously improve model quality:** Monitor, test, and iterate on model accuracy, robustness, privacy, and safety within live clinical workflows.
  
  - **Contribute across the product:** Collaborate across the stack—from APIs and backend systems to product UX and workflow design—to deliver cohesive, AI-driven features.

  **We expect you to have:**
  
  - **ML and data depth:** 3+ years of experience ingesting, structuring, and analyzing diverse data sources, with strong proficiency in Python, SQL, and data tooling (e.g., pandas or equivalent).
  
  - **Production AI experience:** Hands-on experience building and operating NLP and/or LLM-powered systems in production, including frameworks such as spaCy, LangChain, and extensive LLM API usage.
  
  - **Pipeline expertise:** Significant experience designing and maintaining data and ML pipelines in production environments.
  
  - **Cloud and infrastructure fluency:** Experience working in AWS environments, including containerized workloads and orchestration for training and inference.
  
  - **Healthcare familiarity:** Experience working with healthcare data and an understanding of the constraints of regulated environments, or strong motivation to develop this expertise.
  
  - **Cross-functional communication:** Ability to collaborate effectively with engineers, product leaders, and clinical stakeholders.
  
  - **Ownership mentality:** Demonstrated success operating in early-stage or high-growth environments with broad technical responsibility.
  
  - **Full-stack capabilities:** Comfort contributing beyond core ML work, including APIs, system design, or frontend-adjacent development when needed.
  
  - **NYC-based**: You are based in New York and excited to be in-office ~3 days per week.
  
  Target compensation for this role is $200-$250k, plus equity and a generous benefits package.
