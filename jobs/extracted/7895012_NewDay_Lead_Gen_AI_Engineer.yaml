description: |
  We are looking for a Lead Gen AI Engineer to play a key hands-on technical role in designing, building and scaling production-grade Generative AI solutions across the business.
  
  This role sits within MLOps function and focuses on hands-on technical execution and architecture, working closely with platform, security and business teams to bring GenAI use cases from concept into reliable, secure, and production-ready systems.
  
  **What you will Deliver **
  
  - Design, architect and deliver production-grade GenAI solutions using LLMs, RAG, vector search, and prompt engineering, ensuring scalability, security, reliability and maintainability.
  
  - Drive GenAI projects end-to-end, evolving solutions from proof-of-concept to production with strong technical quality, operational readiness, and robust monitoring/observability.
  
  - Provide hands-on technical leadership, mentoring engineers, defining engineering standards, leading design reviews, and guiding key architectural and build-vs-buy decisions.
  
  - Collaborate across the organisation, integrating GenAI services with enterprise systems, cloud platforms, and working closely with business, platform and infrastructure teams.
  
  - Lead technical execution of real-world GenAI applications (e.g., support assistants, case handling automation, fraud investigation, decision support) while identifying risks, dependencies and trade-offs.
  
  **Skills & Experience**
  
  - Proven experience leading the development and deployment of GenAI systems in enterprise environments.
  
  - Deep hands-on expertise with LLMs, RAG architectures, vector databases, and orchestration frameworks.
  
  - Strong understanding of prompt design, context management, and GenAI-specific risks such as hallucination and data exposure.
  
  - Experience integrating GenAI solutions with enterprise systems and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure)
  
  - Proven ability to work independently and collaboratively across technical and business teams to deliver high-quality solutions with clear business value.
  
  - Strong communication skills, able to explain technical decisions and trade-offs clearly in cross-functional environments.
  
  **Desirable**
  
  - Background in AI/ML engineering, AI solution architecture, or software engineering, with strong hands-on experience designing and building production-ready GenAI systems.
  
  - Experience working within CI/CD and observability frameworks to deploy, monitor and iterate GenAI systems in production environments.
  
  - Experience working in large-scale or regulated enterprise settings.
  
  - Proven track record delivering GenAI solutions across areas such as knowledge assistants, customer support, commercial automation, and engineering tools.
  
  - Understanding of practical evaluation approaches for GenAI in production, including user feedback mechanisms, performance considerations, and assessing response usefulness and relevance.
  
  - Exposure to advanced GenAI orchestration patterns and frameworks such as tool use, memory management, or agentic workflows.
