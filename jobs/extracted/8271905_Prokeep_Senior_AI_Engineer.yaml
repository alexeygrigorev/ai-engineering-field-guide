  **About Us**
  
  Prokeep is an Order Engine on a mission to empower distributors to win by turning every customer interaction into an order opportunity.
  Trusted by 8,000+ distributor locations and 40,000+ users, Prokeep makes it easy for over 3 million contractors, technicians, plumbers, electricians, mechanics, and other skilled professionals to order parts, troubleshoot issues, and generally, get what they need and get on with their day. 
  
  Built for the $100+ billion distribution market, Prokeep eliminates missed opportunities caused by busy phone lines, scattered customer data, and passive sales habits. By centralizing communication and enabling proactive outreach, we help teams take more orders from any channel and get more orders by driving demand—fueling growth, stronger relationships, and greater impact across the supply chain.
  
  Having recently secured a $25M Series A investment, we’re poised for rapid growth and innovation. If you're passionate about tackling complex challenges in a collaborative, fast-paced environment while contributing to an often-overlooked yet vital sector of the economy, we’d love to have you on board.
  Let’s shape the future together—one order at a time!

  Be Humble. Be Human. – Respect and authenticity allow us to build meaningful and lasting relationships.
  Have Fun! – Positivity, perseverance, and a bit of laughter all allow us to make an impact while enjoying the rollercoaster!
  
  **Your Mission **
  
  Prokeep is building the future of order automation for distributors, and we’re hiring a Senior / Staff AI Engineer to help integrate AI directly into our core product. This is a high-impact role shaping AI strategy at a growing product company, with the opportunity to build and evolve AI-powered capabilities that are central to how our customers work.
  
  You’ll focus on applying modern LLMs and data-driven systems to deliver meaningful, customer-facing features—not training custom models from scratch. You’ll play a key role in advancing our Order Automation capabilities, defining how AI is used across the product, and partnering closely with Engineering and Product to turn ideas into production-ready solutions.

  - 
  
  Build, iterate, and scale AI-powered features using LLMs and modern AI platforms, with a strong focus on application-level integration
  
  - 
  
  Help define and drive Prokeep’s AI strategy, including where and how AI should be used across the product
  
  - 
  
  Serve as an internal evangelist and subject-matter expert for AI, helping teams understand capabilities, tradeoffs, and best practices
  
  - 
  
  Lead AI evaluation and testing efforts, owning not just the AI engines but also the testing and evaluation frameworks used to measure quality, reliability, and performance
  
  - 
  
  Design and maintain internal tooling to support AI development, experimentation, and evaluation
  
  - 
  
  Partner with Product, Engineering, and Leadership to identify high-impact opportunities where AI can improve customer workflows
  
  - 
  
  Make thoughtful decisions around model selection, orchestration, prompting strategies, and cost/performance tradeoffs
  
  - 
  
  Work closely with our Data Engineer to ensure the right data foundations exist to support AI features
  
  - 
  
  Ensure AI systems are production-ready, observable, and scalable
  
  - 
  
  Improve systems already in flight while contributing to greenfield initiatives—AI is not a silo here
  
  **Qualifications (About You)**
  
  - 
  
  6+ years of experience building and shipping full-stack, customer-facing applications
  
  - 
  
  Hands-on experience building AI-powered application features using LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, or similar)
  
  - 
  
  Experience taking AI features from concept to production, not just prototypes
  
  - 
  
  Strong product and customer mindset—you think in workflows and outcomes, not just models
  
  - 
  
  Solid understanding of how data enables AI features, including data quality, structure, and access
  
  - 
  
  Comfortable operating in ambiguity, balancing experimentation with delivery
  
  - 
  
  Willingness to work in Elixir (primary backend); strong experience with Python expected
  
  -
