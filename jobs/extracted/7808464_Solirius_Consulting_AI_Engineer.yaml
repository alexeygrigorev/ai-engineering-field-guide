  **About us:**
  
  Solirius Reply, part of the Reply Group, delivers technical consultancy and application delivery to our clients in order to solve real world problems and allow our clients to respond to an ever-changing technical landscape. We partner closely with our clients, embedding our consultants into their businesses and providing a bespoke service, allowing us to truly understand our clients’ needs.
  
  It is this close collaboration with our clients that has enabled us to grow rapidly in recent years and will drive our ambitious future growth plans. We currently have over 300 consultants working with a variety of clients from both the public and private sectors, such as the Ministry of Justice, Department for Education, FCDOS, UEFA, International Olympic Committee and Mercedes Benz. 
  
  We operate as a flat organisation and believe in trusting and supporting our team to operate independently. We pride ourselves on being specialists at what we do, making the most of our consultants’ expertise in their fields to provide a best-in-class service to our clients. All our consultants have opportunities to work on a range of different projects, providing a broad range of knowledge on which to develop their careers and progress in the direction they choose.
  
  **About you:**
  
  You are a motivated and adaptable professional with a strong analytical mindset and a passion for using technology to solve real-world problems. You enjoy working in collaborative, agile teams and take pride in delivering high-quality solutions that make a tangible impact. With strong communication skills and a consultative approach, you’re comfortable engaging with clients, understanding their needs, and translating them into effective outcomes. You understand and align with Solirius Reply Values.
  
  **The Role:  **
  
  We are looking for an experienced AI Engineer to join our team here at Solirius. You will join a multidisciplinary practice comprising Data Scientists, Data Engineers, and Software Engineers, developing and delivering exciting projects with a fantastic team of technology experts.
  
  Your primary focus will be designing, architecting, and deploying robust AI solutions and pipelines that enable advanced analysis and Generative AI capabilities, often in highly regulated environments. Either drawing on existing expertise, or with some development, you will be capable of advancing further to design complex, multi-agentic systems that solve real-world problems.
  
  Additionally, you will act as a technical champion for modern development practices, utilising and coaching others on AI-assisted and agentic coding techniques to elevate our, and our clients’, engineering velocity.
  **Requirements**
  
  **Key Responsibilities:**
  
  - **Core AI Solution Design: **Design, build, and maintain scalable AI architectures and pipelines that support business requirements, ranging from predictive modelling to Generative AI applications.
  
  - **LLM Integration:** Operationalise Large Language Models (e.g., GPT, Llama, Mistral) and NLP workflows (BERT, topic modelling) for production environments.
  
  - **Agentic & Multi-Agent Systems:** Design and orchestrate autonomous agentic workflows (using frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, or CrewAI) that can reason, plan, and execute tasks across multiple tools.
  
  - **Production Engineering: **Work collaboratively with Data Engineers to ensure model deployments are supported by robust data storage, vector databases, and cloud infrastructure.
  
  - **AI-Assisted Development (AICA):** Act as a practitioner and mentor for AI-assisted coding. You will champion the use of tools (e.g., Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) and help upskill internal teams and clients on agentic coding workflows.
  
  - **Advisory & Strategy: **Provide technical consulting on AI product development, helping clients understand the distinction between standard ML and agentic AI.
  
  - **Continuous Learning: **Stay updated with the latest trends in the AI engineering field, such as the modern AI stack, synthetic data generation, and Explainable AI.
  
  **Key Skills/Experience:**
  
  - **Engineering Foundations: **Strong proficiency in Python and robust software engineering principles, with experience operating as part of engineering teams.
  
  - **Generative AI & RAG:** Proven experience working with LLMs and designing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, including knowledge of semantic search and vector retrieval.
  
  - **AICA Proficiency:** Experience using AI-assisted and agentic coding tools to accelerate development, with the ability to articulate and teach these methods to others.
  
  - **Consulting Aptitude: **Passionate, motivated, and enthusiastic about developing technology solutions with the ability to explain complex AI concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
  
  **Bonus Skills/Experience:**
  
  - **Agentic Systems: **Experience designing and orchestrating autonomous agentic workflows (e.g., LangGraph) and managing agent state/memory.
  
  - **Cloud:** Experience working with cloud infrastructure (Azure, AWS, or GCP).
  
  - **Agile Delivery: **Experience working in an Agile development environment.
  
  - **Data Engineering:** Proficiency in SQL and relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, DuckDB). Experience with the modern data stack, building data ingestion pipelines and working with ETL and orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow, Luigi, Argo, dbt), big data technologies (Spark, Kafka, Parquet), and web frameworks for model serving (e.g. Flask or FastAPI).
  
  - **Data Science: **Familiarity or experience with classical NLP techniques (BERT, topic modelling, summarisation), statistical analysis, and knowledge graphs.
  
  - **Deep Learning: **Familiarity or experience with Deep Learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
  **Benefits**
  
  **Package and Benefits:**
  
  - Competitive Salary
  
  - Bonus Scheme
  
  - Private Healthcare Insurance
  
  - 25 Days Annual Leave + Bank Holidays
  
  - Up to 10 days allocated for development training per year
