  enough to build it.

  to e-commerce giants to space startups, have saved $10B and
  27.5M hours with Ramp. Founded in 2019, Ramp powers the
  fastest-growing corporate card and bill payment platform in
  America, and enables over $100 billion in purchases each
  year.

  Capital, Sands Capital, General Catalyst, Founders Fund,
  Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, Greylock, Redpoint, and
  ICONIQ, as well as over 100 angel investors who were
