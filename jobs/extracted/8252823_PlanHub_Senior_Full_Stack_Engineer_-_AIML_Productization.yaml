  - Build production-ready APIs and microservices that expose ML model capabilities to applications and end users.
  
  - Design and implement scalable inference systems supporting both real-time and batch prediction workflows.
  
  - Develop robust data pipelines for ingesting, processing, validating, and preparing data for ML systems.
  
  - Create user-facing features powered by AI capabilities including intelligent search, recommendations, and automation.
  
  - Implement frontend code and application integrations using Angular to produce end-to-end user experiences that consume AI and ML models at inference time in a responsive manner.
  
  - Optimize model serving for performance, latency, throughput, and cost efficiency.
  
  - Implement comprehensive logging, monitoring, error handling, and alerting for AI-powered features.
  
  - Collaborate closely with AI Engineers to understand model requirements, constraints, and integration needs.
  
  - Work with Product and Engineering teams to translate business requirements into scalable technical solutions.
  
  - Leverage AWS services such as Lambda, ECS, API Gateway, SQS, and DynamoDB to build resilient systems.
  
  ****What you will need to be successful:****
  
  - Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or related field.
  
  - 5+ years of full stack software engineering experience building and maintaining production systems.
  
  - Strong proficiency in backend development using Python (preferred) or other modern languages.

  - Experience designing and building RESTful APIs and microservices architectures.
  
  - Solid understanding of system design principles, scalability patterns, and performance optimization.
  
  - Hands-on experience with AWS cloud services and serverless architectures.
  
  - Familiarity with ML concepts and ability to collaborate effectively with data scientists and ML engineers.
  
  - Experience with databases (SQL and NoSQL), caching strategies, and data processing pipelines.
  
  - Knowledge of containerization (Docker) and CI/CD practices.
  
  - Strong problem-solving skills with attention to code quality, testing, and maintainability.
