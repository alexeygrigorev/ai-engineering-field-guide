  ****About the Bletchley Fellowship****
  
  The Bletchley Fellowship is a work-integrated fellowship program designed to align how technologists learn with how modern AI products are actually built and deployed.
  
  Rather than treating education and employment as separate phases, the Fellowship intentionally combines structured learning with real, paid work on production systems. Fellows are placed with vetted employer partners while progressing through a rigorous curriculum focused on AI/ML and Data Science.
  
  The Fellowship exists for individuals who want to build durable technical capability, work on meaningful systems, and develop real responsibility earlier and more deliberately than traditional career paths allow.
