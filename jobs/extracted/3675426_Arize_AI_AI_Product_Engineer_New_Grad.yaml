That’s where we come in. **Arize AI is the leading AI & Agent Engineering observability and evaluation platform**, empowering AI engineers to ship high-performing, reliable agents and applications. From first prototype to production scale, Arize AX unifies build, test, and run in a single workspace—so teams can ship faster with confidence.
  
  We’re a **Series C** company backed by top-tier investors,** **with** over $135M in funding** and a rapidly growing customer base of **150+ leading enterprises and Fortune 500 companies. **Customers like Booking.com, Uber, Siemens, and PepsiCo leverage Arize to deliver AI that works.
  
  **The Opportunity**
  
  AI is rapidly transforming the world. Whether it’s developing the next generation of human-level intelligence, enhancing voice assistants, or enabling researchers to analyze genetic markers at scale, AI is increasingly integrated into various aspects of our daily lives.
  
  Arize AI is the leading AI observability and evaluation platform, empowering AI engineers to build and deploy high-performing, reliable models. As the AI landscape shifts from traditional ML to generative AI and agentic systems, Arize ensures teams have the tools to monitor, troubleshoot, and improve AI in production.
  
  **The Role**
  
  We are looking for exceptionally motivated new graduates to join our high-performing team. While this is an entry-level position, our expectations are anything but. You'll be working alongside senior engineers who will challenge you to grow rapidly and take on significant responsibilities from day one.
  
  We are a fully remote company with offices in Bay Area, NYC
  
  **What You’ll Work On**
  
  - 
  
  You will be a part of the core team that drives AI product innovation at Arize. You will be challenged with understanding how some of the most impactful engineering teams are developing AI and LLM-powered applications, and how to build the right tools to enable them to do their best work. Our product solutions range from clean APIs that magically instrument applications, interactive playgrounds for prompt engineering and agent development, or scaling up real-time evaluation infrastructure to handle millions of annotations per second.
  
  Most of our code is written in Go, but we also work with Python, Java, and TypeScript. This isn't a typical new grad role where you'll be relegated to simple tasks - you'll be diving into complex technical challenges like:
  Computing model evaluation metrics across billions of data points
  
  - Creating AI Agents that help customer troubleshoot their own applications
  
  - Building on top of a cutting-edge custom OLAP database.
  
  - Implementing advanced dimensionality reduction techniques
  
  - Building systems that handle millions of annotations per second
  
  **What We’re Looking For**
  
  - 
  
  This is NOT a role for everyone – it demands an exceptional level of drive and commitment. In return you can expect world class mentorship and opportunities to accelerate your career in the most important field in software today. You should be comfortable with:
  Taking ownership of complex problems from day one
  
  - Putting in the extra effort to learn new technologies rapidly
  
  - Pushing yourself outside your comfort zone regularly
  
  - Maintain high standards of code quality despite being new to the industry
  
  - Think critically about system and product design rather than just following instructions
  
  **What Will Set You Apart**
  
  - Experience working with GraphQl or a comparable API technology.
  
  - Experience working with ML, analytics, data science or data visualization products.
  
  - Working knowledge of Machine Learning and/or Data Science.
  
  - First-hand experience working with large language models (LLMs) or developing AI products.
  
  The estimated annual salary and variable compensation for this role is between $100,000 - $135,000, plus a competitive equity package. Actual compensation is determined based upon a variety of job related factors that may include: transferable work experience, skill sets, and qualifications. Total compensation also includes a comprehensive benefit package, including: medical, dental, vision, 401(k) plan, unlimited paid time off, generous parental leave plan, and others for mental and wellness support.
  
  While we are a remote-first company, we have opened offices in New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area, as an option for those in those cities who wish to work in-person. For all other employees, there is a WFH monthly stipend to pay for co-working spaces.
