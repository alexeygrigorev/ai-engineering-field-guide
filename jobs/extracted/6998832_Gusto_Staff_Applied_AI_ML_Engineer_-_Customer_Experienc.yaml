  and New York, we’re proud to support more than 400,000 small
  businesses across the country, and we’re building a
  workplace that represents and celebrates the customers we
  serve. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy.
  
  About the Role:

  AI/ML solutions at scale.
  
  For this role, we are looking for a technical leader (an
  individual contributor) to drive the scale and optimization
  of our customer experience and customer journey via building
  AI and ML enabled experiences and services. In this role you
  will build and optimize AI/ML solutions and infrastructure
  that power our customer journey related products.
  
  You’ll be working with a strong AI/ML team and seasoned
  leaders in Engineering, Product, Design, Data Science,
  Marketing, and Sales. In this role, you’ll work cross
  functionally to build Platforms that span the entire breadth
  of the unified service platform stack using machine learning
  and AI to personalize world class content for our customers
  and enhance customer experience.
  
  Here’s what you’ll do day-to-day:
  
  - Design and develop scalable, production-grade AI and machine
    learning models for solving complex business problems.
  - Lead and mentor teams of ML engineers, fostering a culture
    of technical excellence and innovation.
  - Collaborate cross-functionally with product, engineering,
    and business stakeholders to identify AI opportunities and
    translate them into actionable solutions.
  - Stay current with latest AI research; prototype and
    implement new algorithms and advancements from academia
    and industry.
  - Oversee model validation, deployment, evaluation, and
    lifecycle management, ensuring robust monitoring,
    explainability, and performance.
  - Guide technical strategy, roadmap, and architectural
    decisions for the ML/AI function.
  - Communicate findings, roadmaps, and performance results
    clearly to executives and non-technical partners.
  
  Here’s what we're looking for:
  
  - 8+ years’ hands-on experience building and deploying end-to-
    end ML/AI systems in industry or academia.
  - Deep expertise in one or more advanced ML methods
    (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning, deep
    learning, NLP, LLMs, RAG, etc.).
  - Proven track record of delivering large, impactful ML/AI
    projects into production environments.
  - Proficient in modern ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch,
    HuggingFace, etc.) and cloud computing platforms (AWS,
    GCP, or Azure).
  - Strong programming skills in Python and familiarity with
    best engineering practices (CI/CD, testing, code review).
  - Demonstrated leadership in cross-disciplinary teams and
    ability to mentor scientists and engineers.
  - Excellent communication skills and business acumen.
  - Ph.D. or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Machine
    Learning, Statistics, Mathematics, or a related field is a
    plus.

  $230k-280k for San Francisco, New York, and Seattle $205k -
  255k in Los Angeles, $185k-234k in Denver, and 200k-250k CAD
  for Toronto. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple
  factors including candidate experience and expertise and may
  vary from the amounts listed above.
  
  Gusto has physical office spaces in Denver, San Francisco,
  and New York City. Employees who are based in those
  locations will be expected to work from the office on
  designated days approximately 2-3 days per week (or more
  depending on role). The same office expectations apply to
  all Symmetry roles, Gusto's subsidiary, whose physical
  office is in Scottsdale.
  
  Note: The San Francisco office expectations encompass both
  the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas.
  
  When approved to work from a location other than a Gusto
  office, a secure, reliable, and consistent internet
  connection is required. This includes non-office days for
  hybrid employees.
  
  Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We
  hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not
  just because it's the right thing to do, but because it
  makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our
  enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at
  Gusto.
