  At Vanta, our mission is to help businesses earn and prove trust.** **We believe that security should be monitored and verified continuously, and we empower companies to practice better security and prove it with ease. Vanta has a kind and talented team, and while some have prior security experience, many have been successful at Vanta without it. 
  
  At Vanta, our go-to-market (GTM) teams are the engine behind our growth. We’re looking for a **GTM Engineer** who will sit at the intersection of business systems, data, and AI and build workflows that help Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, and RevOps move faster and operate more intelligently.
  
  You will own the strategy and execution of AI-driven automations across our GTM stack using tools like Salesforce, HubSpot, Gong, Clay, Workato, n8n, and dbt/Snowflake.
  
  This is a hands-on engineering role for someone who loves solving complex business problems with elegant, maintainable systems — and wants a direct, measurable impact on how Vanta finds, wins, and grows customers. Your work will directly influence pipeline generation, win rates, renewal velocity, and rep productivity.
  
  **What you’ll do as a GTM Engineer at Vanta**
  
  - 
  
  Systematize and Automate the GTM Motion: Identify high-leverage opportunities for AI and automation across GTM workflows (e.g. prospecting, pipeline generation, account research, renewal prep).
  
  - 
  
  Build AI-powered workflows & agents: Design, build, and maintain AI-driven workflows and agents using a mix of workflow tools (Salesforce flows and Workato) and code (e.g., Python, SQL)
  
  - 
  
  Build and Ship Internal Tools: Design, develop, and maintain internal-facing web applications leveraging Claude Code and Netlify.
  
  - 
  
  Partner with GTM Leadership: Work with Sales and Post Sales leadership to understand their needs and build custom AI-based solutions that align with their strategic goals
  
  - 
  
  Ship reliable, maintainable systems: Develop technical documentation, monitoring, and testing frameworks to ensure that GTM systems and AI workflows are reliable, observable, and easy to adopt.
  
  - 
  
  Experiment, evaluate, and iterate: Evaluate and implement new GTM and AI technologies, APIs, and tools (e.g., enrichment platforms, orchestration tools, AI vendors) with a clear “build vs. buy” perspective.
  
  **How to be successful in this role:**
  
  - 
  
  Experience 5+ years of experience in business systems, GTM engineering, data/analytics engineering, or a similar role in high-growth B2B SaaS.
  
  - 
  
  AI & systems mindset: Strong knowledge of how AI and automation can be applied in business and GTM systems (e.g., workflow automation, summarization, routing, scoring).
  
  - 
  
  Technical skill set: Prior software engineering experience, proficiency with Salesforce (data model, Flows, integrations) and experience integrating other GTM systems (e.g., Gong, Heap and other marketing automation tools), Strong SQL skills; experience with modern data stack tools like Snowflake and dbt is a plus.
  
  - 
  
  Collaboration: Excellent communication and interpersonal skills to work effectively with internal stakeholders and cross-functional teams.
  
  - 
  
  Open to using AI to amplify their skills and strengthen their work - demonstrating curiosity, a willingness to learn, and sound judgment in applying AI responsibly to improve efficiency and impact

  **About Vanta**
  
  We started in 2018, in the wake of several high-profile data breaches. Online security was only becoming more important, but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build a solid security foundation. Vanta was inspired by a vision to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security. From our early days automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA and ISO 27001 to creating the world's leading Trust Management Platform, our vision remains unchanged. 
  
  Now more than ever, making security continuous—not just a point-in-time check— is essential. Thousands of companies rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their trust— all in a way that's real-time and transparent.
