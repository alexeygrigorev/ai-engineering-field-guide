  ****What We Do****
  
  Rillet serves accounting and finance teams. Our customers are the financial brains of their companies. Our job is to help them run the numbers with impossible speed, accuracy, and insight.
  
  Rillet is an AI-native ERP that can drive a zero-day close. We are different because of our unified source-of-truth data model, hundreds of best-in-class native integrations (Stripe, Ramp, Salesforce, etc), automated & auditable workflows, multi-entity consolidation, and quickly expanding army of specialized AI agents (e.g., accrual, audit, P&L flux, board decks, etc). These earn us a consistently perfect customer satisfaction score. High-growth AI customers like Windsurf, Postscript, and Finch love our ship velocity, because their financial stack needs to scale as quickly as they do.
  
  This huge market is ours to take. We have raised $100M from leading investors (including Sequoia, a16z, Iconiq, Oak HC/FT, and First Round) to **help everyone run their numbers at the speed of AI.**
  
  ****Who We Are****
  
  Rillet’s pace is not for everyone. Intelligence is table stakes. To succeed here, you need extreme speed, agency, and flexibility.
  
  Successful Rilleteers do not wait for assignments. They internalize a mission, design a strategy, and bring back results that are better, faster, and more creative than a manager could have asked for.
  
  Work revolves around our customers. Successful Rilleteers are energized by delivering the most important things, even those that weren’t in the original plan.
  
  In this role, you do not need to be an accountant. But you do need to appreciate the value that our customers can create for their own company when we equip them with the perfect financial tools. Successful Rilleteers love powering the financial core of the world’s fastest-growing companies.
  ****Who We Need:****
  
  We're looking for a machine learning engineer to build the AI systems that will define the future of accounting software. You'll work directly with our CTO to architect solutions that turn complex financial workflows into elegant, automated experiences—the kind of problems that actually matter.
  
  We're looking for teammates who value in-person collaboration and are within commutable distance of our NYC or San Francisco offices (or willing to relocate). Team members are required to work in-office Tuesdays and Thursdays, plus one additional flexible in-office day. Certain roles may require additional in-office time based on function.
  
  ****What You'll Do:****
  - 
  
  Shape Rillet's ML strategy and infrastructure for the long term
  
  - 
  
  Own problems end-to-end, from understanding user needs with product and design teams to deploying production systems
  
  - 
  
  Build automated pipelines for model training, evaluation, and deployment
  
  - 
  
  Ensure ML systems scale reliably under real-world conditions
  
  ****What We're Looking For:****
  - 
  
  3+ years building ML products at tech companies
  
  - 
  
  Strong Python skills (numpy, pandas, sklearn, pytorch) and experience across ML techniques and backend systems
  
  - 
  
  Experience with LLM-based agent frameworks
  
  - 
  
  Bachelor's in CS or related field (Master's/PhD in AI preferred)
  
  - 
  
  Someone who finds practical solutions without cutting corners and enjoys both independent work and tight collaboration
  
  ****Life at Rillet:****
  - 
  
  **Competitive Pay & Benefits: **Backed by world-class investors, we offer strong salaries plus equity so you share in our success. We've got you covered with top-tier health and dental insurance, premiums partially or fully covered for you, plus 90% coverage for dependents.
  
  - 
  
  **Room to Grow:** We're building a team of ambitious, high-performing people who will grow with the company. As Rillet scales, so will your role, responsibilities, and compensation.
  
  - 
  
  **Flexibility That Works: **Take the time you need with flexible PTO and 9 company-wide holidays. We value both the flexibility of remote and hybrid work and the creativity and energy that comes from in-person collaboration at our hubs in San Francisco, NYC, and Barcelona.
  
  - 
  
  **Build Real Connections: **Great work happens when people connect. Join us for team offsites in incredible locations, our team has bonded everywhere from New York and San Francisco to Toronto, Italy, France, and beyond.
