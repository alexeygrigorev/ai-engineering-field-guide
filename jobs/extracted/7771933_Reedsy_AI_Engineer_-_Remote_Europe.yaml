  **About Reedsy**
  
  We’re here to give authors the tools and resources they need to create beautiful books. Our marketplace gathers the industry's best publishing professionals — the likes of Neil Gaiman's editor, Nora Roberts' book marketer, and GRRM’s cover designer.
  
  We’ve grown to a community of 5,000,000 authors, and transformed the way people write and publish their book. Want to hop on board and help us get to our next destination? Cool, keep reading!
  
  **Responsibilities**
  
  At Reedsy, our goal is to build the best ecosystem for writers, supporting them at every stage of their creative journey. Over the years, we've developed a suite of products, including a marketplace, book discovery platform, writing app, central authentication system, and email marketing tools.
  
  As a publishing startup, we're thoughtful about how we integrate AI. As an AI Engineer, you'll help us empower authors to do more — enhancing creativity, not replacing it. You’ll focus on building intelligent features that support storytelling and streamline workflows.
  
  In this role, you will:
  
  - 
  
  Design and implement AI-powered tools for authors (e.g. a narrative co-pilot, visual storyboarding assistant, etc.);
  
  - 
  
  Improve internal workflows by automating repetitive tasks and enhancing UX across our products;
  
  - 
  
  Build internal tools for AI development, including evaluation benchmarks and automated testing;
  
  - 
  
  Collaborate closely with engineers and operations teams to identify high-impact AI opportunities.
  
  ****Requirements****
  - 
  
  Proven experience integrating AI/ML into real-world products, with ownership of the full lifecycle — from modeling and evaluation to deployment and go-to-market execution.
  
  - 
  
  Experience working with large language models (e.g., prompt engineering, fine-tuning, model selection, retrieval-augmented generation)
  
  - 
  
  Familiarity with orchestration tools (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, or custom chaining frameworks)
  
  - 
  
  Knowledge of hallucination detection and mitigation strategies
  
  - 
  
  Hands-on experience with cloud platforms (preferably Google Cloud Platform) and scalable AI deployment
  
  - 
  
  Familiarity with embeddings, vector databases, and Elasticsearch
  
  - 
  
  Experience with AI developer tooling (e.g., Cursor, intelligent CI/CD, AI-powered QA)
  
  Bonus Points
  
  - 
  
  Fluent in multiple languages. Reedsy welcomes applicants of all cultures and backgrounds.
  
  - 
  
  A good dose of ambition, a willingness to learn, and a great sense of humor
  
  ****Benefits****
  - 
  
  Work from home
  
  - 
  
  Paid paternal and maternal leave
  
  - 
  
  Annual team retreat
  
  **Salary range:**
