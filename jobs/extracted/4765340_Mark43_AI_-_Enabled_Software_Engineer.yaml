  Senior Software Engineer – AI-Enabled Engineering
  
  Mark43’s mission is to empower communities and their
  governments with new technologies that improve the safety
  and quality of life for all. We build powerful, scalable,
  and elegant software that sets a new standard for the tools
  upon which our first responders rely. Our users are diverse,
  and we are therefore committed to embracing diversity of
  thought and experience within our team.
  
  Our platform is already trusted by major public safety
  agencies across North America—including Boston, D.C.,
  Seattle, and the California Highway Patrol—and we’ve
  recently expanded into the UK with our first customer
  overseas.
  
  Now, we’re entering an exciting new chapter: Mark43 is
  building a next-generation AI-augmented engineering team.
  This is a foundational opportunity to help rethink how
  software is designed, developed, and delivered using
  intelligent agentic or related tools.
  
  
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer to help lead
  our AI-enabled engineering initiative. You’ll work at the
  frontier of AI and software development, experimenting with
  agentic workflows and shaping how AI tools are integrated
  into every layer of our engineering stack.
  
  This isn’t just about using AI to autocomplete code—it’s
  about designing and orchestrating systems of AI agents that
  can plan, write, review, test, and deploy software
  collaboratively. In essence, you’ll play a role akin to a
  tech lead for a team of intelligent coding agents.
  
  You will:
  
  - Design multi-agent systems with coding-focused agents (e.g.,
    code writer, reviewer, tester, deployer)
  
  - Write the prompts, logic, and scaffolding that guide each
    agent’s behavior
  
  - Handle tool use, like enabling agents to access the file
    system, test runners, version control, and internal APIs
  
  - Evaluate and refine agents’ output, performance,
    collaboration patterns, and feedback loops
  
  If you were on the team last week, you might have:
  
  - Prototyped a new coding assistant workflow using open-source
    LLMs and internal knowledge bases
  
  - Led an architecture discussion on agentic build pipelines or
    automated PR generation
  
  - Collaborated with a cross-functional team to build a fast,
    AI-powered interface for internal tooling
  
  - Helped define the evaluation framework for AI
    contributions—accuracy, speed, and impact
  
  - Mentored a teammate on combining TypeScript and AI tools to
    accelerate UI prototyping
  
  - Explored best practices for safely and securely integrating
    generative AI into a public sector codebase
  - Participated in our on call rotation
  
  
  
  What You’ll Need
  
  We’re looking for an experienced software engineer who is
  eager to build smarter systems by pairing technical
  expertise with emerging AI tools. You don’t need to be an AI
  researcher—but you do need hands-on experience applying
  generative AI tools to real-world development workflows.
  
  You should have:
  
  - 5+ years of professional software engineering experience
  
  - Proficiency with at least part of our stack: Java,
    TypeScript + React, and MySQL
  
  - Extensive applied experience with AI-assisted development
    tooling—whether it’s Cursor, Windsurf, LLM APIs, codegen
    platforms, vector databases, agentic frameworks like
    LangChain, or custom-built systems
  
  - A strong product mindset and interest in building for real-
    world impact
  
  - A bias toward experimentation, iteration, and continuous
    learning
  
  - Comfort operating in ambiguity and helping define best
    practices in a rapidly evolving space
  
  We’re flexible on which tools you’ve used—we care more about
  your ability to learn, adapt, and creatively apply AI in
  practical settings than checking a specific tech box.
  
  People Who Thrive on Our Team Also Tend to Be:
  
  - Humble, open, and curious. You ask questions and seek to
    understand before making assumptions
  
  - Collaborative by default. You believe the best outcomes come
    from shared knowledge and ownership
  
  - Mission-driven. You care about building tech that serves the
    public good
  
  - Comfortable with uncertainty. You’re energized by open
    problems and emerging technologies
  
  - Growth-oriented. You embrace feedback, learn from setbacks,
    and look for ways to get better every day
