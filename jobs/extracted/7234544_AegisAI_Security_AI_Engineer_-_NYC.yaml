  We’re a team of ex-Google engineers who built some of the
  largest defensive platforms on the planet — Safe Browsing
  and reCAPTCHA. Now, we’re striking out on our own to tackle
  an even bigger challenge: stopping the new wave of
  adversarial AI attacks already hitting organizations today.
  
  We’re still in stealth, but here’s what we can say: We're
  going after a $5B+ market, ripe for disruption. Traditional
  detection methods are too slow to keep up. Adversaries are
  using AI to craft customized, high-evasion attacks — and
  old-school rules-based systems don’t stand a chance.
  
  Your Mission: Architect a constellation of AI Agents — fast,
  cheap, and high-precision — that work together to detect and
  stop emerging threats. You’ll live deep in live threat data,
  evolving your agents at the speed of the battlefield. These
  agents will operate under an orchestration layer designed
  for rapid iteration and adaptive learning.
  
  Why This Is Hard (a.k.a. Why It’s Fun)
  
  - The models change daily. Literally. What worked yesterday
    might be obsolete tomorrow.
  - The adversaries are smart — and getting smarter. We’re in a
    real-time arms race against AI-enabled attackers crafting
    tailored, evasive payloads.
  - There’s no playbook. We’re building new detection paradigms
    as fast as the threats evolve. It’s high-stakes, high-
    impact work — and you’ll be in the arena from day one.
  
  If you’re the kind of engineer who lives for tough problems
  and fast feedback loops, this is your kind of challenge.
  
  Why We’ll Win
  
  - The market is massive — $5B+ and growing fast — and
    incumbents are too slow to adapt.
  - We’ve done this before. Our team built the core technology
    behind Safe Browsing (5B+ users) and reCAPTCHA (protecting
    5M+ websites) while at Google.
  - This is our third time building a category-defining security
    business. We know how to scale both the tech and the
    company.
  - AI and security are in our DNA. We don’t bolt it on — we
    build it in from day one.
  - We only hire top performers. Most of our team were top 1%
    engineers at Google — if you were the best at your last
    job, you’ll feel right at home here.
  - We move fast. No politics. No hierarchy. Just brilliant
    people solving hard problems, together.
  
  What We’re Looking For: We want engineers who are outgrowing
  their current roles — people who want to build at the very
  edge of AI and cybersecurity.
  
  - You thrive in relentless environments where learning curves
    are steep and every day is a new challenge.
  - You care about speed, execution, and complete thinking more
    than resumes or titles.
  - You think in weeks and days, not months and quarters.
  
  Despite 30+ years of combined AI experience on the founding
  team, we know today’s landscape changes too fast to rest on
  credentials. We prioritize adaptability and speed of
  learning above all else.
  
  Our culture:
  
  - Flat, flexible, and fast.
  - You’ll own your decisions and your tech stack.
  - You’ll have clear KPIs for success — but how you get there
    is up to you.
  - Development cycles are measured in days, not weeks.
  
  If you’re hungry to build AI that fights AI, and want to
  work with a team that moves at the speed of the real world,
  come talk to us.
