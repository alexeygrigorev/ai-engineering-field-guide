description: |
  Valence has built the only first-to-market AI native
  coaching platform for enterprise, offering personalized,
  expert, and human-like guidance and support to any leader or
  employee. We’re not just talking about the future of work —
  we’re building it now, with the most innovative Fortune 500
  companies across healthcare, financial services,
  manufacturing, and technology.
  
  Our focus is on the problems that actually decide whether AI
  changes how organizations operate — the ones with no
  playbook, no obvious answers, and no guarantee of success.
  If you want to be part of the small group that defines how
  AI transforms the future at a global scale, this is your
  chance.
  
  And this isn’t for everyone. We’re not looking for people
  who want predictability or incremental progress. We only
  want those who are restless at the edge of what’s possible,
  who get bored when things feel “done,” and who are driven to
  redefine what AI can mean for leaders, companies, and the
  world. Because at Valence, the work worth doing is the kind
  that redefines work itself.
  
  The Role
  
  As a founding Applied AI Engineer at Valence, you will help
  define and build the future of AI-powered leadership
  coaching, working directly with our Head of AI and cross-
  functional product and engineering teams. You’ll be at the
  intersection of generative AI research and product execution
  - helping design, build, and refine intelligent systems that
  deliver context-aware, personalized coaching at enterprise
  scale. This role is purposefully broad and adaptable: we
  don’t expect any one candidate to check every technical box,
  but we do look for engineers who are eager to learn, iterate
  rapidly, and contribute meaningfully across a range of
  challenges from model behavior to production systems.
  
  You’ll tackle real-world AI problems - from transforming
  enterprise data into actionable context, to optimizing
  conversational experiences, to shaping how AI engages with
  users in meaningful and responsible ways. Your work will
  directly impact how our platform performs in high-stakes
  enterprise deployments and how leaders around the world grow
  through AI-facilitated insights.
  
  About Valence
  
  We're the only company pioneering leadership coaching for
  large enterprises in an AI-first way. Our mission is to
  transform how the world's biggest companies approach
  learning and development, helping teams work better together
  through AI-powered personalization that adapts to individual
  goals and organizational culture using the latest advances
  in machine learning and natural language processing.
  
  We've been featured in Harvard Business Review, TIME, World
  Economic Forum, Financial Times, Forbes and an Inc. 5000
  fastest-growing private companies in America. Our clients
  represent the most diverse and sophisticated enterprise AI
  implementations globally, including Coca-Cola, Delta,
  Nestlé, General Mills, Schneider Electric, Deutsche Telekom,
  AstraZeneca, Prudential, CVS and Bristol Myers Squibb.
  
  Working at Valence means you'll work directly with Fortune
  500 technology leaders, building expertise through the most
  complex enterprise deployments while gaining insight into
  diverse organizational approaches to AI transformation.
  These aren't just any enterprise clients - they're the
  companies defining what AI-first business transformation
  looks like across every major industry.
  
  What You'll Do
  
  - Architect and build enterprise-grade AI and conversational
    systems that power coaching workflows and user
    experiences.
  - Develop, evaluate, and refine LLM-based components -
    balancing performance, scalability, and reliability in
    real use cases.
  - Integrate and manage diverse sources of structured and
    unstructured data to improve contextual understanding and
    output quality.
  - Partner closely with product, engineering, and design to
    translate user needs into impactful technical solutions.
  - Rapidly prototype and iterate on systems that span backend
    services, data pipelines, and frontend interactions as
    needed.
  - Build tooling, tests, and automation to support reliable
    model deployment, observability, and continuous
    improvement.
  - Help streamline data and science workflows, enabling fast
    experimentation and data-driven decisions.
  - We recognize that not every candidate will have experience
    in every area above - we value growth potential,
    curiosity, and the ability to learn on the job.
  
  What We're Looking For
  
  - Technical foundation: 3+ years of experience in software
    engineering, AI/ML, data-intensive systems, AI/ML
    development (ideally including a Master's or Ph.D. in
    Computer Science, ML, Data Science, or a related field).
  - AI systems mindset: Familiarity with language systems (e.g.,
    NLP, conversational interfaces, IR) and comfort reasoning
    about model behavior, context, and evaluation - both
    theoretical and practical knowledge.
  - Data tooling & analysis: Experience with core data science
    tools such as NumPy, scikit-learn, Pandas, PySpark, plus
    SQL and common visualization tools (e.g., matplotlib,
    Seaborn, Plotly, or BI tools) to explore and communicate
    insights.
  - Cloud & deployment experience: Comfortable developing and
    deploying services in cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure)
    and working with containerization/orchestration (Docker,
    Kubernetes).
  - Engineering excellence: Strong software engineering skills,
    including writing maintainable code, debugging distributed
    systems, and collaborating in cross-functional teams.
  - Growth orientation: Eagerness to tackle unfamiliar problems,
    learn new technologies, and contribute to shaping our
    platform and culture.
  - Communication: Ability to explain technical ideas clearly
    and work effectively with both technical and non-technical
    stakeholders.
  - Nice-to-have (but not required): experience with ML
    lifecycle tools (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases),
    familiarity with Cloud ML services, or past work building
    generative AI applications.
  
  What You'll Get
  
  - Ownership & Rapid Growth
  - Outsized missions from day one, with direct responsibility
    for company-defining projects
  - Work alongside the executive team with transparency into
    strategy and decision-making
  - Influence on direction through real-time customer feedback
    and market insights
  - AI-First Operator
  - Work directly with cutting-edge AI models and next-
    generation platforms
  - Build expertise in enterprise AI implementation across
    Fortune 500 companies and multiple industries
  - Establish yourself as a recognized leader among peers in
    shaping how AI transforms work at a global scale
  - Compensation
  - Competitive salary including base + bonuses
  - Comprehensive health coverage (medical, dental, vision) from
    day one
  - Generous PTO, company-wide R&R shutdowns, and paid parental
    leave
  - Retirement plan support for US and global employees
  - Equity
  - Meaningful ownership in a venture-backed company at a growth
    inflection point
  - Financial upside that comes from scaling fast
  - Top-up grants as we scale and you deliver exceptional
    performance — your compensation grows alongside your
