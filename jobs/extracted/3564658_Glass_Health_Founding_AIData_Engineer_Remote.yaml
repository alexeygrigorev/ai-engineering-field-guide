  **About Glass Health**
  
  Glass Health was physician co-founded because we believe that technology should be fully leveraged to optimize the practice of medicine and improve patient care. We’re building the better tools we as physicians want, so we can spend more quality time with our patients.
  
  To this end, we have set out to **empower clinicians with the best-in-class AI for clinical decision support (CDS)**.
  
  We aim to increase diagnostic accuracy, improve the implementation of evidence-based medicine, accelerate the achievement of health equity, eliminate clinician burnout, and improve patient outcomes worldwide.
  
  **
  
  About the role:**
  
  We’re looking for experienced, problem-solving engineers across the stack **(Product, Full-Stack, Backend, Applied AI/LLM)** to build new products and grow existing products. Our success depends on our ability to quickly iterate on products, while also ensuring that they are performant and reliable. You’ll work in a deeply iterative, collaborative, fast-paced environment to bring our technology to tens of thousands of users, and ensure it’s delivered with finesse and reliability in mind.
  
  While we have a head-start, this is a Founding engineering role - you will have expanded ownership, a defining impact on the success of the company, and play a crucial part in shaping the future of healthcare.
  
  **Depending on the role, you will:**
  
  - Design and build the development and production platforms that power our new products, enabling reliability and security at scale
  
  - Own the development of new user-facing generative AI features and product experiences end-to-end
  
  - Partner with researchers, engineers, product managers, and designers to bring new features and research capabilities to the world
  
  - Accelerate engineering productivity by empowering your fellow engineers with excellent tooling and systems
  
  - Help create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture that makes all feel welcome while enabling radical candor and the challenging of group think
  
  - Like all other teams, we are responsible for the reliability of the systems we build. This includes an on-call rotation to respond to critical incidents as needed
  
  **You might thrive in this role, if you:**
  
  - Have 5+ years of engineering experience in various tech environments, including product-driven companies.
  
  - Have experience with TypeScript/React on the frontend, Python on the backend, adaptability, and a drive to learn new technologies.
  
  - Are comfortable taking ownership in an ambitious, fast-paced and diverse startup environment.
  
  - Possess significant experience in designing, building, and scaling production systems to deliver new product capabilities and manage increasing demand.
  
  - Are committed to creating outstanding user experiences and take pride in developing solutions that meet customer needs.
  
  - You are excited about and stay up-to-date with rapidly advancing changes in AI and LLM technology.
  
  - Demonstrate humility, a collaborative spirit, and a willingness to support your colleagues to ensure team success.
  
  - Take ownership of challenges from start to finish, and are proactive in learning new skills as needed.
  
  - Build tools to accelerate your own (and your teammates’) workflows, but only when off-the-shelf solutions won’t do.
  
  - Have experience in startup environments, either as a founder or an early-stage engineer (bonus points, not required).
  
  - Are familiar with healthcare, EHR, HIPAA & other healthcare regulatory structures (bonus points, not required).
