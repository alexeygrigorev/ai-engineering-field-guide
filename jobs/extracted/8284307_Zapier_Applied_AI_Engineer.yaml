  AI at Zapier
  
  At Zapier, we build and use automation every day to make
  work more efficient, creative, and human. So if you’re using
  AI tools while applying here - that’s great! We just ask
  that you use them responsibly and transparently.
  
  Check out our guidance on How to Collaborate with AI During
  Zapier’s Hiring Process, including how to use AI tools like
  ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or others during our hiring process
  - and when not to.
  
  Hi there!
  
  Zapier is hiring for an Applied AI Engineer to help us build
  the future of automation with AI at its core. If you care
  about shipping real products, solving hard problems with
  large language models, and creating tools that help others
  build faster—this is your kind of role.
  
  We’re hiring acrossteams, each with their own flavor of AI
  work. You’ll work on things like shared libraries,
  evaluation systems, orchestration patterns, or user-facing
  features—depending on the team. What they all have in
  common: you’ll ship to production, own meaningful problems,
  and make an impact across the company.
  
  Even though our job description may seem like we're looking
  for a specific candidate, the role inevitably ends up
  tailored to the person who applies and joins. Regardless of
  how well you feel you fit our description, we encourage you
  to apply if you meet these criteria:
  
  About You
  
  - You have 5+ years of experience in software engineering,
    with at least 3 of those years dedicated to building
    distributed, scalable cloud based web applications. You
    possess strong communication skills, problem-solving
    abilities, and a drive to deliver outstanding customer
    experiences for both external users and internal
    stakeholders.
  - You have at least 1 year of experience working with large
    language models (LLMs) to perform complex tasks in
    production environments. You experimented with build user
    facing leveraging agent architectures.
  - You’re familiar with underlying technologies like
    transformer networks, attention mechanisms, and how they
    contribute to models’ abilities to generate coherent
    responses, generate function calls, and perform other
    language tasks.
  - You have likely deployed evaluation frameworks for LLMs,
    with an understanding on performance, reliability, and
    bias assessment.
  - You likely have experience with Retrieval-Augmented
    Generation (RAG) systems and understand how to optimize
    knowledge retrieval for improved model accuracy and speed.
    You likely have experience with different indexing and
    chunking strategies based on the system’s data and goals,
    as well as semantic search and vector databases, and how
    they differ from traditional retrieval methods and
    databases.
  - You have experience of working through the full lifecycle of
    building, testing, deploying, and scaling LLM
    architectures.
  - You can identify and document trade-offs made during the
    development process. You also have experience building
    with cloud infrastructure technologies.
  - You love shipping to customers. You’ll be on a team focused
    on understanding customers' needs and translating those
    needs from specifications into functional, production-
    ready code. You know how to balance speed versus quality
    to support the features we build for our customers.
  - You embody our values. At Zapier, our values are at the
    heart of how we work together and how we think about our
    customers. In our remote setting, they help develop trust
    and ensure we work and collaborate to democratize
    automation.
  
  Things You’ll Do
  
  - You understand that AI-based applications thrive on data-
    driven feedback loops, which will be central to any system
    you develop. These loops will capture and instrument user
    data, synthesize core use cases, and implement/test
    strategies with LLMs to enhance performance.
  - You will be responsible for integrating LLMs into software
    products at Zapier, which will include setting up the
    necessary infrastructure to ensure performance,
    scalability, and reliability.
  - You will work mostly in Python or TypeScript. Experience
    isn’t strictly required, but it is a big plus. Comfort
    with typed languages and modern backend practices is a
    must.
  - You will build tooling and infrastructure that enables teams
    to iterate on AI products faster, without sacrificing
    safety or reliability.
  - You will improve the state of cost observability across all
    teams, and work with individual teams to optimize spend
    for their products.
  - You will monitor the performance and health of AI systems,
    proactively detecting and addressing issues such as system
    failures and performance degradation.
  - You will collaborate with Data and cross-functional teams to
    refine and deploy LLM-based features.

  Difference between an Applied AI Engineer and an ML Engineer
  at Zapier:
  
  How do we discern between other AI-forward engineering roles
  like ML Engineers and Applied AI Engineers? Both roles
  benefit from backend engineering skills and experience with
  LLMs.
  
  - ML engineers are expected to have more experience building
    data pipelines as well as experience utilizing other types
    of ML models beyond LLMs.
  - AI engineers are expected to have more full stack
    engineering experience, which would typically include
    frontend experience, and may only have experience working
    with LLMs.
  
  How to Apply
  
  At Zapier, we believe that diverse perspectives and

  check process.
