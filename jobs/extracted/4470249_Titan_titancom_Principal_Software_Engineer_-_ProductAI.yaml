  **About Titan**
  
  Titan is an award-winning wealth manager with a mission to increase our generation’s compound growth rate. We plan to do this by putting a human wealth advisor in every pocket.

We harness frontier technologies like artificial intelligence to build a platform that gives advisors superpowers, enabling them to serve clients they historically never could. Backed by a16z, General Catalyst, Sam Altman, and many others, we manage over $1 billion in assets for clients across the country.

  **Role Overview**
  
  Hey Dave Schatz here, CTO of Titan 👋 I was early at Facebook with Zuck, built Gas with Nikita Bier (hit #1 in the App Store, later acquired by Discord), and now I’m leading engineering at Titan, some of the most rewarding and high-impact work I’ve ever done.

  Contribute to our award-winning mobile app, built with React Native.
  
  - 
  
  Enhance and maintain our content generation and administrative tools, developed in React.
  
  - 
  
  Optimize backend systems that handle millions of dollars in daily transactions, leveraging Node.js.
