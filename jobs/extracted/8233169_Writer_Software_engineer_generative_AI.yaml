  In this pivotal role, you'll be at the forefront of
  expanding human capacity by building the next generation of
  AI-powered solutions that transform how leading enterprises
  operate. You'll dive deep into developing a state-of-the-art
  platform that leverages cutting-edge generative AI
  technologies, from large language models to sophisticated
  agentic workflows, delivering seamless, scalable, and secure
  applications that redefine enterprise productivity. This is
  an unparalleled opportunity to make a tangible impact,
  shaping the future of AI and contributing to a product
  that’s changing how the world works.
  
  This role is hybrid, based out of our San Francisco, New

  - Build and optimize high-performance, low-latency APIs and
    microservices for integrating advanced AI models and
    agentic workflows into our platform
  - Collaborate closely with product managers, data scientists,
    and cross-functional engineering teams to translate
    complex business needs into innovative AI solutions, from
    concept to production
  - Implement and maintain responsive user interfaces (primarily
    focused on backend enablement though some frontend
    interaction is expected) using technologies like React and
    TypeScript to deliver intuitive user experiences
  - Partner with DevOps teams building continuous deployment,
    logging and monitoring; ensuring top-tier performance and
    reliability
  - Own key architectural components, ensuring best practices in
    code quality, security, and maintainability through
    rigorous testing and peer reviews

    applications, leveraging LLMs, vector databases (e.g.,
    Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector), and modern open source
    agentic Frameworks.
  - Deep understanding and practical experience with
    microservices architecture, RESTful APIs, and cloud
    platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Azure, including
    containerization with Docker and Kubernetes
  - Solid grasp of modern web technologies including FastAPI,
    Asyncio, and database systems like PostgreSQL
  - A "Connect" mindset, thriving in collaborative settings
    where you actively engage with cross-functional teams and
    mentor junior engineers to achieve shared goals
  - A "Challenge" spirit, demonstrating exceptional problem-
    solving skills to tackle complex technical hurdles and
    proactively suggest innovative improvements to our systems
    and processes
  - An "Own" attitude, taking full accountability for delivering
    high-quality, resilient, and scalable code from conception
    through to production, continuously driving performance
    and maintainability
