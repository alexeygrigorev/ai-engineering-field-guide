# AI Engineering Field Guide

Data-driven field guide to AI engineering roles, skills, and interviews.

Everything here is based on real data: 1,765 actual job descriptions, real interview experiences, and real stories from practitioners. This is not AI-generated filler dumped into a repo - every insight comes from analyzing actual data and synthesizing patterns from it.

My vision for this repo is to become **the** go-to resource for AI engineering. Like [data-science-interviews](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/data-science-interviews) but broader:

- role analysis
- job market data
- interview questions
- learning paths
- and more

It's a work in progress, and I'm actively adding more content. Your input is very welcome - feedback and contributions help shape what goes in here.

**Star** this repo to keep an eye on updates. To get notified about new content, subscribe to my newsletter: [Alexey on Data](https://alexeyondata.substack.com/).


## The AI Engineer Role

- [My vision of the role](role/01-my-vision.md) - how I see AI engineering, comparison with DS/ML/DE roles, CRISP-DM for AI
- [Skills analysis](role/02-skills.md) - top skills, job types, cloud platforms, frameworks
- [Responsibilities](role/03-responsibilities.md) - patterns extracted from 5,694+ job responsibilities
- [Use cases](role/04-use-cases.md) - 4,525 real use cases showing what companies build with AI
- [Reality vs. job postings](role/05-reality-vs-postings.md) - what candidates experience vs. what's advertised


## Interview Preparation

- [Interview process analysis](interview/01-interview-process.md) - common patterns, step counts, time estimates, AI use in hiring, key takeaways
- [Home assignments](interview/03-home-assignments.md) - 17 take-home assignments and 5 paid work trials analyzed in detail
- [Interview questions](interview/02-interview-questions.md) - technical and behavioral questions (work in progress)
- [Skills that get you hired](interview/04-skills-that-get-you-hired.md) - baseline expectations, differentiators, and portfolio strategy
- [AI system design](interview/05-ai-system-design.md) - system design for AI applications (work in progress)
- [Company-by-company data](interview/data/) - individual interview process descriptions for 51 companies, linked to source job postings


## Learning Paths

- [General learning path](learning-paths/) - what to learn and in what order
- [From Data Engineer](learning-paths/from-data-engineer.md) - smoothest transition, 3-4 months
- [From Data Scientist](learning-paths/from-data-scientist.md) - evaluation is your superpower, add engineering
- [From ML Engineer](learning-paths/from-ml-engineer.md) - easiest transition, replace model call with API call
- [From Backend Engineer](learning-paths/from-backend-engineer.md) - 2-3 months, add AI on top of engineering
- [From Frontend Engineer](learning-paths/from-frontend-engineer.md) - backend first, then AI, unique full-stack advantage


## Portfolio

- [Project ideas](portfolio/) - real project examples that demonstrate AI engineering skills


## Job Market Data

1,765 job descriptions scraped from builtin.com covering LA, NY, London, Amsterdam, Berlin, and India.

- [Structured job descriptions](job-market/data_structured/) - YAML files with title, company, skills, compensation, and full descriptions
- [Raw extracted postings](job-market/data_raw/) - original extracted data


## Coming Soon

- Salary analysis and compensation data
- Community-contributed interview experiences


## Event Series

This field guide is part of a 4-part event series on AI engineering careers:
