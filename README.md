### Job Market

Based on analysis of 895 job postings from January 2026:

- **70%** work directly on AI (RAG, agents)
- **93%** need skills beyond just GenAI
- **35.9%** mention RAG - the most common pattern
- **64.3%** require some ML knowledge
- **AWS > Azure > GCP** in cloud preferences

## Key Insights

### The Two Patterns That Matter

> **RAG + Agents = 70%+ of AI Engineering work**

If you learn these two patterns deeply, you can handle most AI engineering use cases.

- **RAG** - Connect LLMs to your data (documents, databases)
- **Agents** - LLMs that use tools to accomplish tasks

### AI Engineers Are Full-Stack

Only 1.4% of roles expect pure GenAI work. Most need:

- **Cloud** - AWS, Azure, or GCP
- **Ops** - Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD
- **Web** - React, FastAPI (for 50%+ of roles)
- **Python** is mandatory (82.5% of jobs)

### Three Types of "AI Engineer" Roles

| Type | What They Build | % of Jobs |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| **AI-First** | RAG systems, agents, fine-tuned LLMs | 69.4% |
| **AI-Support** | Platforms, infrastructure, tooling | 28.5% |
| **ML** | Traditional ML/DL (rebranded) | 1.8% |
