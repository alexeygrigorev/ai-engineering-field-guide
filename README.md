## Key Findings

- 69.4% of "AI Engineer" roles are AI-First (RAG, agents, LLMs), not traditional ML
- 93.1% need skills beyond just GenAI - this is a full-stack role
- RAG is the #1 pattern (35.9% of all jobs)
- Python (82.5%), AWS (40.1%), Docker (31.0%) are the top skills
- 64.3% of roles still require some ML knowledge
- Only 1.4% of roles expect pure GenAI work
