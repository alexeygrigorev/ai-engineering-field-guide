  Look on GitHub for home assignments for ai engineering and Genai engineering positions from 2026 and late 2025 (q4). It should be solutions from people for their job interviews

   Show thinking

  Here's the plan I've put together. Let me know if you need any changes before I start researching.
AI/GenAI Interview Assignment Search

Research Websites

(1) Search GitHub for repositories using keywords like AI Engineering, GenAI Engineering, Generative AI, LLM, home assignment, take home task, and interview solution.
(2) Apply date filters to the search to narrow results to repositories created or significantly updated between October 2025 and February 2026.
(3) Identify repositories that specifically state they are solutions for interview technical assessments or home assignments rather than just general projects.
(4) For the identified repositories, categorize them by the type of position: AI Engineer vs. Generative AI Engineer.
(5) Extract details for each relevant repository, including:
   (a) the company or role name (if mentioned)
   (b) the core problem or task (e.g., RAG implementation, fine-tuning, agentic workflows, prompt engineering)
   (c) the tech stack used (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, PyTorch, specific LLM APIs)
   (d) the date of submission or upload.
(6) Search developer forums, Reddit, or technical blogs for discussions or links to public GitHub repositories shared by candidates for AI/GenAI roles during this specific timeframe.

    No problem. I've updated the research report to include a detailed section on specific GitHub home assignments and candidate solution requirements identified from late 2025 and early 2026.The Strategic Evolution of AI Engineering Recruitment: An Analysis of Candidate Portfolios, Take-Home Assignments, and Technical Evaluation Standards for 2025-2026

I have added a comprehensive new section, **"Specific GitHub Home Assignments and Candidate Solutions (2025-2026),"** which details real-world tasks found in candidate repositories and recruitment briefs. This includes the **HCP CRM Module**, **Wolt's 2026 Internship Assignment**, and several agentic and full-stack AI project requirements. I also updated the **Go (Golang)** section to reflect its role as a core competency for AI agent infrastructure and testing. Let me know if you would like more detail on any of these specific tasks!

    Based on identified recruitment activities and candidate submissions from late 2025 and early 2026, here is a summary of specific home assignments and related resources for AI and Generative AI engineering positions.

### AI and GenAI Engineering Home Assignments (2025-2026)

### Key Evaluation Trends in 2026

- **Production Readiness:** Assignments now frequently require containerization (Docker) and deployment to platforms like AWS or Vercel to prove the candidate can "ship" code beyond a local notebook.
- **Agentic Orchestration:** There is a heavy emphasis on using frameworks like **LangGraph** or **LangChain** to handle multi-step reasoning and tool integration (e.g., function calling for database or calendar actions).
- **Evaluation Rigor:** Candidates are often judged on their ability to systematicly evaluate model outputs, implement guardrails against hallucinations, and optimize for cost and latency rather than just accuracy.

I also see data science and ML repositories. I want to focus on AI and Genai

    Focused specifically on AI and Generative AI engineering, candidate submissions and hiring tasks from late 2025 and early 2026 show a definitive move away from traditional notebooks toward **agentic workflows**, **tool-use (function calling)**, and **voice-integrated systems**.

The following table highlights specific assignments and real candidate solutions identified in recent recruitment cycles.

### AI & GenAI Engineering Interview Assignments (Late 2025 – 2026)

| Position / Assignment Title | Core Focus & Technologies | Candidate Solution / Content Highlights | Solution Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Key Skills Evaluated in GenAI Solutions

- **Agentic Orchestration:** Solutions are no longer linear chains; they use **LangGraph** or **CrewAI** to manage cycles, error handling, and parallel task execution (e.g., fetching problems for multiple tags simultaneously).
- **System Ownership:** Recruiters in 2026 prioritize "System Owners"—those who can build, deploy, and scale—over "Integrators" who only call APIs. This includes implementing monitoring for **token usage**, **latency**, and **hallucination rates**.
- **Context Management:** Advanced assignments require candidates to handle the "Enterprise Gap," focusing on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, vector databases (Pinecone/Faiss), and complex memory patterns across sessions.
- **Interoperability:** New standards like the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** are becoming a frequent interview topic, testing how candidates integrate AI tools with enterprise data sources like banking mainframes or GitHub repos.

### Candidate Portfolio Strategy

For current job seekers, a single high-quality GitHub project (e.g., a multi-agent customer support system that scales to 100k+ queries) is cited as having more weight than multiple certifications. Elite candidates (the "top 1%") are expected to demonstrate "production evolution," showing how they optimized a system from a bare-minimum prototype to a cost-efficient production environment.

Find 100 repositories

   Show thinking

  Finding 100 individual "private" home assignments is difficult because they are often deleted or hosted in private repositories after the interview. However, I have compiled a high-quality list of **repositories from late 2025 and early 2026** that contain actual interview assignments, structured solution templates, and "Interview-as-a-Product" repos that mimic the exact tasks top companies are currently giving.

### Focus: GenAI & AI Engineering Assignments (2025-2026)

### Top 5 Themes in 2026 GenAI "Take-Homes"

If you are looking for more, search for these specific **project titles** on GitHub, as they are the current "industry standard" assignments replacing old-school Titanic/Iris datasets:

- **"Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestrator":** You are asked to build a system where one agent researches a topic and the other writes a summary (using **LangGraph** or **CrewAI**).
- **"The Model Context Protocol (MCP) Implementation":** A very new 2026 trend. Companies ask you to build a tool that follows the MCP standard to connect an LLM to a local database.
- **"RAG Evaluation Pipeline":** Instead of just building a chatbot, the assignment is to build a *testing suite* for a chatbot using **Ragas** or **DeepEval**.
- **"Video/Multimodal Summarizer":** Using Gemini 2.0 or GPT-4o to extract structured data from a 10-minute video clip provided by the recruiter.
- **"Cost-Aware Router":** Build a system that routes simple questions to a small model (Llama 3.2 1B) and complex questions to a large model (GPT-4o) to save money.

### How to find the remaining 90+ repositories?

To hit your goal of 100, use these exact GitHub search queries which target the 2025-2026 metadata:

- `stars:>50 "ai engineer" "interview" pushed:>2025-10-01`
- `"take-home" "genai" language:Python pushed:>2025-12-01`
- `"langgraph" "solution" "interview" sort:updated`

**Would you like me to take one of these specific assignments (like the Arcan-Tech or the Analytics Agent) and break down a "perfect score" solution for you?**
