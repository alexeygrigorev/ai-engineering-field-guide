# AI Use Cases Analysis

Based on 4,525 extracted use cases from 895 job descriptions.

**Methodology note:** I collected all use cases into a single file and used AI (Claude) to analyze and categorize them. This is not a quantitative analysis like the [skills analysis](01-skills.md) (see the [analysis notebook](../job-market/analysis.ipynb) for that) - it's based on the questions I asked and the patterns Claude identified in the data. It may be less precise, but I believe it's still representative of what's happening in the market.

## Key Insights

### 1. Automation is the Primary Use Case

The most common problem AI solves is automating manual workflows. This is not glamorous - it's about reducing repetitive work, coordinating processes, and handling scale.

### 2. Knowledge Access is Universal

Every domain has the same problem: too much information, cannot find what's needed. RAG and semantic search solve this across healthcare (medical literature), finance (regulations), legal (contracts), and general enterprise (internal docs).

### 3. Customer Support is a Major Driver

Customer-facing solutions are a top category because they directly impact revenue and customer satisfaction. The ROI is clear: reduce support costs while improving response times.

### 4. Production is Hard

A significant portion of use cases focus on deployment infrastructure. This reflects the real challenge of getting AI models from notebooks to production reliably.

### 5. Domain Specialization Matters

While fewer in number, fine-tuned models for specific domains (insurance, legal, cybersecurity) represent high-value applications where generic models are insufficient.

## Memory and State Management in AI Applications

A significant subset of AI applications requires memory and state management capabilities. These are primarily found in agentic AI systems that need to maintain context across multiple interactions.

Memory-related use cases: 174 mentions (3.8%)

This includes use cases mentioning:
- Memory management
- State management
- Context retention
- Conversation history
- Session state

### Agent Memory Systems

11 explicit mentions of "memory" in agent systems:

- Building fault-tolerant AI applications with reliable execution for reasoning, tool calls, and memory management
- Designing structured retrievable memory systems for reliable long-term agent behavior
- Agentic AI systems for business problem solving with memory, planning, and tool-use capabilities
- Memory-aware AI agents that maintain coherent understanding across extended teaching workflows while managing token budgets
- Tool-using agents with memory for seamless creative content generation

- Agentic system design with orchestration, tool use, state/memory, and multi-step workflows
- IT operations automation through AI agents with stateful memory and feedback loops
- Organizational memory and knowledge graphs for AI agent context

### Types of Memory in AI Applications

Based on the use cases, memory serves several purposes:

1. Long-term memory - Persistent storage of agent experiences and knowledge
2. Session memory - Context within a single conversation or workflow
3. Working memory - Temporary state during multi-step reasoning
4. Organizational memory - Enterprise knowledge graphs and document repositories

### Key Insight

Memory is a critical component for agentic AI systems. Agents that perform multi-step workflows need to remember:
- Previous actions taken
- Intermediate results
- User preferences and context
- Tool outputs and responses

This reflects "stateful AI" - moving beyond stateless LLM calls to systems that maintain persistent memory and context.
