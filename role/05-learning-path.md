# Learning Path for AI Engineers

Based on skill demand from 895 job descriptions (January 2026).


## The Path

```
Foundation
    Python, APIs, basic web (FastAPI/React)
        ↓
LLM Basics
    Prompt engineering, OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
        ↓
Core Patterns
    RAG (vector DBs, embeddings)
    Agents (LangGraph, orchestration)
        ↓
Frameworks
    LangChain or LlamaIndex
        ↓
Production
    Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, monitoring
```


## The Typical AI Engineering Stack

- Application - React, Next.js, FastAPI
- AI orchestration - LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex
- LLM APIs - OpenAI, Anthropic, local models
- Vector databases - Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector
- Infrastructure - Docker, K8s, AWS/GCP/Azure


## Why This Order

The data shows what employers actually ask for:

- Python is mandatory (82.5% of jobs)
- RAG is the #1 pattern (35.9%) - learn it before agents
- Agents (14.4%) are growing fast but build on RAG fundamentals
- 93% of roles need skills beyond GenAI - production skills matter

Most AI Engineers are full-stack engineers who specialize in AI. Only 1.4% of roles expect pure GenAI work.


## Skills by Priority

### Must have

- Python (82.5%)
- Prompt engineering (29.1%)
- RAG patterns (35.9%)
- At least one cloud platform - AWS (40.1%), Azure (23.9%), GCP (22.9%)
- Docker (31%)

### High value

- LangChain (18.8%) or LlamaIndex (5.8%)
- TypeScript (23.4%)
- FastAPI (10.7%)
- Kubernetes (29.1%)
- CI/CD (29.3%)
- PyTorch basics (22.0%)

### Differentiators

- Agent frameworks - LangGraph (8.0%), CrewAI (3.1%)
- Fine-tuning (8.5%)
- Model evaluation
- Vector databases - Pinecone (5.9%), Weaviate (4.6%)


## What to Learn Based on Role Type

### AI-First (69.4% of jobs)

Focus: RAG, agents, prompt engineering, LLM APIs

These roles build AI systems directly. RAG (50.2%), prompt engineering (42.4%), and agents (33.3%) are the core skills.

### AI-Support (28.5% of jobs)

Focus: Infrastructure, platforms, DevOps, data pipelines

These roles enable AI work. Kubernetes (36.1%), Docker (30.6%), and cloud platforms are more important than GenAI skills. 42.7% of these roles need no GenAI skills at all.
