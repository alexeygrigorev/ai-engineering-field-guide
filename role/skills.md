## How Much ML Do AI Engineers Need to Know?

64.3% of AI-First roles require some ML knowledge

Most common ML skills in AI Engineer roles:

- PyTorch - 165 jobs (26.6%)
- Fine-tuning - 159 jobs (25.6%)
- TensorFlow - 93 jobs (15.0%)
- Embeddings - 81 jobs (13.0%)
- Model training - 80 jobs (12.9%)
- Model evaluation - 69 jobs (11.1%)


Key findings:

1. Most AI Engineers need basic ML knowledge - 64% require some ML skills
2. Fine-tuning is the most common ML task - more common than model training from scratch
3. PyTorch dominates - 2.6x more common than TensorFlow for GenAI roles

Bottom Line: AI Engineers need practical ML knowledge (PyTorch basics, fine-tuning, embeddings) but don't need deep ML expertise unless specifically working on model development.


## What Else (Besides GenAI) Do AI Engineers Need?

93.1% of AI-First roles require skills BEYOND just GenAI

Skill combinations in AI Engineer roles:

- GenAI + Ops (Docker, K8s, CI/CD) - 72.0%
- GenAI + ML skills - 57.5%
- GenAI + Web skills - 49.1%
- GenAI + ANY other tech - 93.1%
- Pure GenAI (nothing else) - 1.4%

### Non-GenAI Skills Expected

| Category | Skills | % |
|----------|--------|--:|
| Cloud | AWS (41.7%), Azure (24.8%), GCP (22.2%) | - |
| Ops | Docker (31.4%), CI/CD (27.7%), Kubernetes (26.6%) | - |
| Web | React (12.9%), FastAPI (12.9%) | ~50% do web work |
| Languages | Python (88.6%), TypeScript (23.3%), Java (15.1%) | Python mandatory |

Full-stack expectations:

- Frontend skills - 195/621 (31.4%)
- Backend skills - 308/621 (49.6%)
- Full-stack (both) - 134/621 (21.6%)

Bottom Line: AI Engineers are full-stack engineers who specialize in AI. Only 1.4% of roles expect pure GenAI work. Most need cloud deployment (AWS/Azure/GCP), containerization (Docker, K8s), CI/CD, and often web development (React, FastAPI).


## Fine-Tuning Requirements

30.8% of AI-First roles mention fine-tuning

### Depth of Fine-Tuning Expectation

| Level | Jobs | % | Description |
|-------|------:|--:|-------------|
| Primary FT responsibility | 25 | 4.0% | FT is main focus (model architecture, LoRA, PEFT) |
| Secondary/occasional FT | 94 | 15.1% | FT mentioned but not core |
| No FT mentioned | 502 | 80.8% | No fine-tuning expected |

### Fine-Tuning Use Cases

- Instruction following - Agents that follow complex instructions, task execution
- Domain knowledge - Medical, legal, finance, industry-specific applications
- Style/Tone - Brand voice, personality, formatting requirements
- Company data - Internal documents, proprietary data
- Performance - Smaller/faster models, latency optimization
- Language - Multilingual, non-English support
- Privacy - On-prem, offline, secure environments

Key findings:

1. Most AI Engineers don't fine-tune - Only ~20% have any FT expectation
2. Primary FT roles are rare - Only 4% focus on fine-tuning as main responsibility
3. Most common FT use case - Domain knowledge (medical, legal, finance) and instruction following for agents
4. FT is a specialization - Not a core AI Engineer skill, more advanced

Bottom Line

- Fine-tuning is optional for most AI Engineers.
- Focus on RAG and agents first. 
- Learn fine-tuning if targeting domain-specific roles (healthcare, finance, legal), performance optimization roles, or specialized model development.


## Key Insight: RAG + Agents = 70%+ of Use Cases

The two dominant patterns are:

- RAG - Connect LLMs to your data (documents, databases)
- Agents - LLMs that use tools to accomplish tasks

If you learn these two patterns deeply, you can handle most
AI Engineering use cases.


## Learning Path for AI Engineers

- Foundation - Python, APIs, basic web development (FastAPI/React)
- LLM Basics - Prompt engineering, OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- RAG - Vector databases, embeddings, retrieval patterns
- Frameworks - LangChain or LlamaIndex
- Agents - LangGraph, agent orchestration
- Production - Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, monitoring

The typical AI engineering stack:

- APPLICATION layer - React, Next.js, FastAPI
- AI ORCHESTRATION layer - LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex
- LLM APIS layer - OpenAI, Anthropic, local models
- VECTOR DATABASES layer - Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector
- INFRASTRUCTURE layer - Docker, K8s, AWS/GCP/Azure
