Today we provide developers a single API to get quotes for insurance products from multiple carriers. Tomorrow we want to build anything that helps developers connect their applications to the insurance ecosystem. We think buying insurance should be as easy as buying anything else online and we want your help!</p><p>We’re a team of insurtech veterans with experience at At-Bay, Kin, and Insurify. We’ve raised our Series A funding from top-tier VCs (Lightspeed, Brewer Lane,&nbsp; Afore, Underscore) along with a panel of insurtech founders (At-Bay, Marble), insurance executives (CRC), and early employees of other successful API infrastructure companies (Plaid, Alloy, Stytch).</p></p><b>&nbsp;</b><b><strong>The role</strong></b><p>Herald is building Babbix, an AI-native platform that commercial insurance brokers use to create submissions and get quotes directly from their inbox. It orchestrates broker workflows end-to-end by combining classification pipelines, data extraction models, and a broker-facing web interface. Delivering high-quality product experiences and shipping new AI-driven capabilities are core to our success.</p><p>As a Senior Software Engineer (Full Stack) on the Babbix product, you’ll drive major product initiatives from inception to delivery. You’ll work directly with brokers and internal stakeholders to shape ideas, turn them into designs, and build them into production-ready features. You’ll work across the stack, from frontend UI to backend APIs to model orchestration, to deliver effortless workflows and make our AI output transparent, accurate, and trustworthy</p><br><p><strong>Why This Role Matters</strong></p><p>Commercial insurance is one of the last major industries still powered by email. Every submission, quote, and policy must be manually processed by brokers, slowing them down and costing them deals.</p><p>By building new product and AI capabilities, you will:</p><ul><li>Transform messy email submissions into structured, actionable data with minimal friction.</li><li>Help brokers move from inbox to quote-ready submissions in minutes instead of hours.</li><li>Enable rapid iteration on new workflows and AI features alongside our product and client services teams.</li><li>Lay the foundation for scaling Babbix across lines of business, carriers, and broker organizations.</li></ul><p>Your work will directly impact how brokers work — transforming an industry still that has been failed by modern software until now.</p><b>You will</b><ul><li><strong>Build Core AI-Product Features for Enterprise Brokers</strong><br>- Own large new areas within our product<br>- Work across backend, frontend, and interact with LLMs and ML models<br>- Deliver experiments at a high velocity and level of quality to engage our customers<br>- Work across the entire product lifecycle from conceptualization through production<br>- Be able, and willing, to multi-task and learn new technologies quickly</li><li><strong>Improve Developer Experience &amp; Internal Tools</strong><br>- Build reusable frontend components, API patterns, and data flows to accelerate product development.<br>- Contribute to internal tooling, testing infrastructure, and CI/CD to improve velocity and reliability.<br>- Help evolve our Google Cloud Platform-based architecture as new product features are launched.</li><li><strong>Collaborate Directly with Clients.</strong><br>- Gather feedback from pilot users and translate it into product improvements and feature priorities.<br>- Work closely with customer success and integrations teams to ensure smooth rollouts and a great user experience.</li></ul><b><strong>What you bring</strong></b><ul><li>4+ years of experience building full-stack product features from design through production.</li><li>Experience shaping products at fast-growing startups.</li><li>Hands-on experience with LLMs, vector databases, or other emerging AI technologies.</li><li>Proficiency in Python or JavaScript/TypeScript, and SQL.</li><li>Experience with Docker and major cloud providers (Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft Azure).</li></ul><p><strong>Nice to Have</strong></p><ul><li>Background in insurance, fintech, or other data-heavy SaaS products.</li><li>Experience with model evaluation, benchmarking, or human-in-the-loop review workflows.</li></ul><b>What we bring</b><ul><li>\uD83D\uDCB0 Competitive compensation packages based on experience</li><li>\uD83D\uDCC8 Company equity</li><li>\uD83C\uDF10 Hybrid-flexible company focussed in the Northeast (NYC and Boston)</li><li>✈️ Relocation stipend (if you want to join us in the Northeast)</li><li>\uD83C\uDF1B Quarterly in-person meetups (on the company)</li><li>\uD83C\uDFDD 20 days of PTO (that roll over) + 12 company holidays + 5 sick days</li><li>\uD83D\uDC8A Quality health, vision, and dental insurance</li><li>\uD83D\uDE86 Pre-tax commuter benefits to be used towards parking &amp; transit costs for those working hybrid in our offices</li><li>\uD83D\uDC75 401K plan</li><li>\uD83C\uDFE0 $500 additional home office stipend (beyond the standard equipment)</li><li>\uD83D\uDC68‍\uD83D\uDC69‍\uD83D\uDC67‍\uD83D\uDC66 Parental leave for all kinds of parents (including adoption and foster care)</li><li>\uD83C\uDFC3‍♀️ An agile and motivated team</li></ul><br><p><p><p><p>Full compensation packages are determined based on candidate experience. Please note that some roles may include variable compensation (such as commission, bonuses, and/or equity) that are not outlined here. This range is depicting base pay only. Any variable compensation will be discussed throughout the hiring process.</p></p><p>New York Pay Range </p><p><span>$200,000</span><span>—</span><span>$230,000 USD</span></p></p></p><p><p><span><strong>Additional information</strong></span></p><p>Diversity, equity, and inclusion are featured prominently in our company's values which you can read about below. Please reach out if you would benefit from any assistance throughout the application or have suggestions about how we can make our process more accessible and inclusive to all people.</p><p>One more note: We want to build an incredible team. As a result, we make a point of being open to surprising candidates who are the right person even though their experience doesn't exactly match up to our job description. Our job descriptions are gestures, not strict criteria. If you think you would be a great addition to our team, but might not fit the criteria perfectly, we still encourage you to apply! We recognize there are many transferable skills and traits that we may not have captured in this description and welcome all interested candidates to apply.&nbsp;</p><br><p><span><strong><span>Life at Herald</span></strong></span></p><p>We're just getting started and building our culture with purpose every day. One of the joys of joining a small company early is that you get to build that culture too. Come join us and help us make Herald an (even more) amazing place to work!</p><p></p><p><br></p><b><span><strong>Actions we value</strong></span></b><p>There are many actions that we hope for and even demand from members of our team: communicating honestly, working hard, behaving with integrity. These are expectations. But we value these five actions above and beyond the level of \"baseline expectation.\" We believe that if we excel at these, our business will thrive. We’re betting the company on it.</p><b><strong>Build trust&nbsp;</strong></b><p>We always lead with empathy. We publicly own and learn from our mistakes just as we are confident and transparent in explaining our decisions. And we help get the work done because we recognize that no job is too small.</p><b><strong>Create a shared reality</strong></b><p>We each articulate the facts, assumptions, questions, and fears we hold about our business. We listen to and learn from others. We create a shared set of information before making decisions.</p><b><strong>Get better every day.</strong></b><p>We constantly seek ways to improve ourselves. We provide each other candid feedback coupled with support to elevate those around us. We refine how we work together to become more effective as a team.</p><b><strong>Build a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community.</strong></b><p>We thrive when our team has a variety of lived experiences, values each other for their unique perspectives, and shares equitably in our mutual success. We invest in building an inclusive community for people who are oppressed because of their race, ethnicity, age, religion, gender expression, sexual orientation, physical ability, or socio-economic class.</p><b><strong>(Remember that) we make the rules.</strong></b><p>We once created the ways we work and therefore can change them. We do not default to momentum. We challenge ourselves to deconstruct the status quo and create a better future.</p><br></p>","directApply":true,"identifier":{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Herald","value":"8597005"},"baseSalary":{"@type":"MonetaryAmount","currency":"USD","value":{"@type":"QuantitativeValue","minValue":200000,"maxValue":230000,"unitText":"YEAR"}},"datePosted":"2026-02-26","employmentType":"FULL_TIME","experienceRequirements":{"@type":"OccupationalExperienceRequirements","monthsOfExperience":108},"applicantLocationRequirements":{"@type":"Country","name":"USA"},"hiringOrganization":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Herald","sameAs":"https://builtin.com/company/herald","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://builtin.com/sites/www.builtin.com/files/2025-09/heraldapi_logo.jpg","representativeOfPage":true}},"industry":["Fintech","Insurance","Financial Services"],"jobLocation":{"@type":"Place","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","addressCountry":"USA","addressLocality":"New York","addressRegion":"New York"},"geo":{"@type":"GeoCoordinates","latitude":40.7130466,"longitude":-74.0072301}},"validThrough":"2026-03-28T14:34:00+00:00"}]

Today we provide developers a single API to get quotes for insurance products from multiple carriers. Tomorrow we want to build anything that helps developers connect their applications to the insurance ecosystem. We think buying insurance should be as easy as buying anything else online and we want your help!</p><p>We’re a team of insurtech veterans with experience at At-Bay, Kin, and Insurify. We’ve raised our Series A funding from top-tier VCs (Lightspeed, Brewer Lane,&nbsp; Afore, Underscore) along with a panel of insurtech founders (At-Bay, Marble), insurance executives (CRC), and early employees of other successful API infrastructure companies (Plaid, Alloy, Stytch).</p></div><b>&nbsp;</b><b><strong>The role</strong></b><p>Herald is building Babbix, an AI-native platform that commercial insurance brokers use to create submissions and get quotes directly from their inbox. It orchestrates broker workflows end-to-end by combining classification pipelines, data extraction models, and a broker-facing web interface. Delivering high-quality product experiences and shipping new AI-driven capabilities are core to our success.</p><p>As a Senior Software Engineer (Full Stack) on the Babbix product, you’ll drive major product initiatives from inception to delivery. You’ll work directly with brokers and internal stakeholders to shape ideas, turn them into designs, and build them into production-ready features. You’ll work across the stack, from frontend UI to backend APIs to model orchestration, to deliver effortless workflows and make our AI output transparent, accurate, and trustworthy</p><br><p><strong>Why This Role Matters</strong></p><p>Commercial insurance is one of the last major industries still powered by email. Every submission, quote, and policy must be manually processed by brokers, slowing them down and costing them deals.</p><p>By building new product and AI capabilities, you will:</p><ul><li>Transform messy email submissions into structured, actionable data with minimal friction.</li><li>Help brokers move from inbox to quote-ready submissions in minutes instead of hours.</li><li>Enable rapid iteration on new workflows and AI features alongside our product and client services teams.</li><li>Lay the foundation for scaling Babbix across lines of business, carriers, and broker organizations.</li></ul><p>Your work will directly impact how brokers work — transforming an industry still that has been failed by modern software until now.</p><b>You will</b><ul><li><strong>Build Core AI-Product Features for Enterprise Brokers</strong><br>- Own large new areas within our product<br>- Work across backend, frontend, and interact with LLMs and ML models<br>- Deliver experiments at a high velocity and level of quality to engage our customers<br>- Work across the entire product lifecycle from conceptualization through production<br>- Be able, and willing, to multi-task and learn new technologies quickly</li><li><strong>Improve Developer Experience &amp; Internal Tools</strong><br>- Build reusable frontend components, API patterns, and data flows to accelerate product development.<br>- Contribute to internal tooling, testing infrastructure, and CI/CD to improve velocity and reliability.<br>- Help evolve our Google Cloud Platform-based architecture as new product features are launched.</li><li><strong>Collaborate Directly with Clients.</strong><br>- Gather feedback from pilot users and translate it into product improvements and feature priorities.<br>- Work closely with customer success and integrations teams to ensure smooth rollouts and a great user experience.</li></ul><b><strong>What you bring</strong></b><ul><li>4+ years of experience building full-stack product features from design through production.</li><li>Experience shaping products at fast-growing startups.</li><li>Hands-on experience with LLMs, vector databases, or other emerging AI technologies.</li><li>Proficiency in Python or JavaScript/TypeScript, and SQL.</li><li>Experience with Docker and major cloud providers (Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft Azure).</li></ul><p><strong>Nice to Have</strong></p><ul><li>Background in insurance, fintech, or other data-heavy SaaS products.</li><li>Experience with model evaluation, benchmarking, or human-in-the-loop review workflows.</li></ul><b>What we bring</b><ul><li>💰 Competitive compensation packages based on experience</li><li>📈 Company equity</li><li>🌐 Hybrid-flexible company focussed in the Northeast (NYC and Boston)</li><li>✈️ Relocation stipend (if you want to join us in the Northeast)</li><li>🌛 Quarterly in-person meetups (on the company)</li><li>🏝 20 days of PTO (that roll over) + 12 company holidays + 5 sick days</li><li>💊 Quality health, vision, and dental insurance</li><li>🚆 Pre-tax commuter benefits to be used towards parking &amp; transit costs for those working hybrid in our offices</li><li>👵 401K plan</li><li>🏠 $500 additional home office stipend (beyond the standard equipment)</li><li>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Parental leave for all kinds of parents (including adoption and foster care)</li><li>🏃‍♀️ An agile and motivated team</li></ul><br><div><div><div><p>Full compensation packages are determined based on candidate experience.

As a result, we make a point of being open to surprising candidates who are the right person even though their experience doesn't exactly match up to our job description. Our job descriptions are gestures, not strict criteria. If you think you would be a great addition to our team, but might not fit the criteria perfectly, we still encourage you to apply! We recognize there are many transferable skills and traits that we may not have captured in this description and welcome all interested candidates to apply.&nbsp;</p><br><p><span><strong><span>Life at Herald</span></strong></span></p><p>We're just getting started and building our culture with purpose every day. One of the joys of joining a small company early is that you get to build that culture too. Come join us and help us make Herald an (even more) amazing place to work!</p><p></p><p><br></p><b><span><strong>Actions we value</strong></span></b><p>There are many actions that we hope for and even demand from members of our team: communicating honestly, working hard, behaving with integrity. These are expectations. But we value these five actions above and beyond the level of "baseline expectation." We believe that if we excel at these, our business will thrive. We’re betting the company on it.</p><b><strong>Build trust&nbsp;</strong></b><p>We always lead with empathy. We publicly own and learn from our mistakes just as we are confident and transparent in explaining our decisions. And we help get the work done because we recognize that no job is too small.</p><b><strong>Create a shared reality</strong></b><p>We each articulate the facts, assumptions, questions, and fears we hold about our business. We listen to and learn from others. We create a shared set of information before making decisions.</p><b><strong>Get better every day.</strong></b><p>We constantly seek ways to improve ourselves. We provide each other candid feedback coupled with support to elevate those around us. We refine how we work together to become more effective as a team.</p><b><strong>Build a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community.</strong></b><p>We thrive when our team has a variety of lived experiences, values each other for their unique perspectives, and shares equitably in our mutual success. We invest in building an inclusive community for people who are oppressed because of their race, ethnicity, age, religion, gender expression, sexual orientation, physical ability, or socio-economic class.</p><b><strong>(Remember that) we make the rules.</strong></b><p>We once created the ways we work and therefore can change them. We do not default to momentum. We challenge ourselves to deconstruct the status quo and create a better future.</p><br></div></div>
