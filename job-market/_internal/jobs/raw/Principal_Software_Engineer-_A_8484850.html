Others seek your input for design reviews, incident postmortems, and architectural bets.</li><li>Cross-functional influence: You partner with product and engineering leadership to define strategy, scope opportunities, and execute for product-line-wide outcomes.</li><li>Rapid domain acquisition: You move into unfamiliar areas quickly and meaningfully contribute—whether it’s a new tech stack, domain model, or organizational challenge.</li><li>Internal and external impact: You elevate HubSpot’s brand, help attract and retain senior talent, and share your knowledge across the company.</li></ul><p><p><p><p><span><strong>Pay &amp; Benefits</strong></span></p><p><span>The cash compensation below includes base salary, on-target commission for employees in eligible roles, and annual bonus targets under HubSpot’s bonus plan for eligible roles.

        <div class="text-gray-04">Los Angeles is a global leader in entertainment, so it’s no surprise that many of the biggest players in streaming, digital media and game development call the city home. But the city boasts plenty of non-entertainment innovation as well, with tech companies spanning verticals like AI, fintech, e-commerce and biotech. With major universities like Caltech, UCLA, USC and the nearby UC Irvine, the city has a steady supply of top-flight tech and engineering talent — not counting the graduates flocking to Los Angeles from across the world to enjoy its beaches, culture and year-round temperate climate. <br/><br/><h4 class="fs-md text-gray-04 fw-semibold mb-md">Key Facts About Los Angeles Tech</h4><ul><li>Number of Tech Workers: 375,800; 5.5% of overall workforce (2024 CompTIA survey)</li><li>Major Tech Employers: Snap, Netflix, SpaceX, Disney, Google</li><li>Key Industries: <a href="/companies/type/artificial-intelligence-companies" target="_blank" class="text-pretty-blue">Artificial intelligence</a>, <a href="/companies/type/adtech-companies" target="_blank" class="text-pretty-blue">adtech</a>, <a href="/companies/type/digital-media-companies/social-media-companies" target="_blank" class="text-pretty-blue">media</a>, <a href="/companies/type/software-companies" target="_blank" class="text-pretty-blue">software</a>, <a href="/companies/type/gaming-companies" target="_blank" class="text-pretty-blue">game development</a></li><li>Funding Landscape: $11.6 billion in venture capital funding in 2024 (Pitchbook)</li><li>Notable Investors:  Strong Ventures, Fifth Wall, Upfront Ventures, Mucker Capital, Kittyhawk Ventures</li><li>Research Centers and Universities: California Institute of Technology, UCLA, University of Southern California, UC Irvine, Pepperdine, California Institute for Immunology and Immunotherapy, Center for Quantum Science and Engineering</li></ul></div></div>
