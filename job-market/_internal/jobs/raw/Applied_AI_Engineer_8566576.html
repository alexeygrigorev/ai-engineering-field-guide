Our models serve 600M+ inference calls monthly, process 1M+ hours of audio daily, and power 2 billion+ end-user experiences—from voice agents and meeting assistants to contact centers and medical scribes. Companies like Zoom, Granola, Fireflies, Cluely, and Calabrio rely on AssemblyAI to ship production-ready voice AI.</p><p>We're at an inflection point in Speech AI. We released Universal-Streaming in mid-2025, and it has quickly earned its place as the model offering the best accuracy-latency-cost tradeoff on the market. Our research team drives these advances and ships with relentless velocity. Since releasing Universal-Streaming, we've already launched keyterms prompting feature and multilingual support—with more significant improvements on the roadmap.</p><p>We've raised $115M+ from Accel, Insight Partners, Y Combinator's AI Fund, Patrick and John Collison, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross. We're a remote team building one of the next great AI companies—and we're looking for researchers who will shape its future.</p></p><b><strong>About the Role:</strong></b><p>We're looking for an Applied AI Engineer to join our team at the intersection of cutting-edge AI research and real-world customer applications. This is a highly dynamic, customer-facing technical role where you'll build demos, troubleshoot production issues, and help customers implement our Speech AI models in creative and impactful ways.</p><p>You'll be working directly with developers and technical teams at companies ranging from early-stage startups to enterprise organizations. Your days will involve rapid context-switching between building prototypes for new use cases, debugging urgent customer issues, and collaborating with our Sales, Success, Engineering, Product, and Research teams to ensure customers succeed with our platform.</p><p>This role requires strong technical skills, excellent communication abilities, and the creativity to solve novel problems under time pressure. You'll be empowered to use AI tools and modern development practices to deliver solutions quickly and effectively.</p><b><strong>What You’ll Do:</strong></b><b><strong>Customer-Facing Technical Work (60%)</strong></b><ul><li><strong>Guide customers through their entire product journey</strong>—from initial implementation and technical onboarding, through development and testing, all the way to production deployment. Continue to provide support post-launch to ensure their implementation is performing optimally and meeting their business objectives</li><li><strong>Build custom demos and prototypes</strong> that showcase how AssemblyAI's models can solve specific customer use cases</li><li><strong>Lead technical discovery sessions</strong> with prospects and customers to understand their requirements and design optimal implementations</li><li><strong>Assist with competitive evaluations</strong> by providing benchmarks, designing fair comparison tests, and helping customers evaluate our models against alternatives. Work closely with customers to ensure they have the data and support needed to make informed decisions</li><li><strong>Troubleshoot production issues</strong> for customers using our streaming and async APIs, sometimes requiring you to debug code in languages you may not use daily (Java, Go, Ruby, etc.)</li><li><strong>Provide technical guidance</strong> on architecture, scaling, data privacy, and best practices for integrating our APIs</li><li><strong>Create proofs-of-concept</strong> that demonstrate the \"art of the possible\" with Speech AI</li><li><strong>Travel to customer sites</strong> for technical workshops, implementation support, and relationship building with key accounts</li></ul><b><strong>Internal Collaboration &amp; Product Influence (30%)</strong></b><ul><li><strong>Serve as the voice of the customer to our Product and Research teams</strong>—test and dogfood new products and features before they reach customers, providing feedback from a practitioner's perspective. Advocate for improvements and new capabilities based on real-world use cases you encounter, ensuring our roadmap aligns with customer needs</li><li><strong>Contribute to documentation, guides, and example code</strong> that help developers integrate our APIs more effectively</li><li><strong>Identify patterns in customer issues</strong> and work with Engineering to address root causes (SDK improvements, better error messages, new features)</li><li><strong>Collaborate with Sales and Success teams</strong> to ensure smooth handoffs and consistent customer experience</li><li><strong>Participate in team off-sites</strong> to align on strategy, share learnings, and build team cohesion</li></ul><b><strong>Innovation &amp; Thought Leadership (10%)</strong></b><ul><li><strong>Stay current on AI/ML developments</strong>, particularly in speech recognition, NLP, and audio processing</li><li><strong>Experiment with new use cases</strong> and applications of our models</li><li><strong>Build and maintain an open-source repository</strong> of demos, integrations, and reference implementations</li><li><strong>Represent AssemblyAI at conferences and industry events</strong>, delivering talks or running workshops when appropriate</li></ul><b><strong>What You’ll Need:</strong></b><b><strong>Required</strong></b><ul><li><strong>Located in or willing to relocate to New York City or San Francisco</strong></li><li><strong>4+ years of customer-facing experience in highly technical environments, requiring strong software engineering skills</strong>, including roles such as Solutions Architect, Developer Advocate, Technical Solutions Engineer, or equivalent</li><li><strong>Strong programming skills in Python and/or TypeScript/JavaScript</strong>, with the ability to read and debug code in other languages</li><li><strong>Excellent written and verbal communication skills</strong>—you'll be writing customer emails, internal documentation, and technical guides regularly</li><li><strong>Experience with web APIs, WebSockets, and real-time data streaming</strong></li><li><strong>Understanding of audio fundamentals</strong> (sample rates, encoding formats, codecs) or willingness to learn quickly</li><li><strong>Ability to leverage AI tools creatively to move quickly</strong>—proficiency with tools like Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, or similar AI-assisted development tools to accelerate prototyping, debugging, and problem-solving</li><li><strong>Problem-solving mindset</strong>—you can debug unfamiliar codebases, identify root causes, and propose creative solutions</li><li><strong>Comfort with ambiguity and fast-paced work</strong>—you'll often be the first line of defense on novel problems</li><li><strong>Ability and willingness to travel</strong> domestically and internationally as needed (approximately 10-25% of the time)</li></ul><b><strong>Preferred</strong></b><ul><li>Experience in a <strong>startup or high-growth environment</strong></li><li>Understanding of <strong>cloud infrastructure</strong> (AWS, GCP, Azure) and deployment patterns</li><li>Experience building <strong>prototypes or MVPs</strong> quickly</li><li><strong>Public speaking or conference presentation experience</strong></li></ul><b><strong>What Makes You Stand Out</strong></b><ul><li><strong>You're independently driven and competitive</strong>—you take ownership of customer outcomes, push yourself to deliver exceptional results, and are motivated by the challenge of solving hard problems and winning customer trust</li><li><strong>You can balance technical depth with customer empathy</strong>—you understand when to dive into the details and when to step back and explain concepts simply</li><li><strong>You thrive under pressure</strong> and can context-switch between building a demo, debugging a production issue, and answering technical questions on a sales call</li><li><strong>You're resourceful and self-directed</strong>—you know when to use AI tools, when to consult documentation, and when to ask for help</li><li><strong>You have a \"get it done\" mentality</strong> and are comfortable wearing many hats</li><li><strong>You're genuinely curious about AI</strong> and excited to see how customers apply our models in unexpected ways</li><li><strong>You enjoy building relationships</strong> with customers and representing AssemblyAI in person</li><li><strong>You're excited about being part of a tech hub</strong> (NYC or SF) and leveraging proximity to customers and the AI community</li></ul><b><strong>Location &amp; Travel Expectations</strong></b><p><strong>Primary Location:</strong> This role is designed for candidates based in <strong>New York City</strong> or <strong>San Francisco</strong>. While AssemblyAI is a remote-first company, these locations position you closer to:</p><ul><li>A high concentration of our customers and prospects</li><li>Major AI/tech conferences and events</li><li>Your team members and cross-functional collaborators</li></ul><p><strong>New York City Office:</strong> We have an office in NYC that's available for team members who want to work in-office, meet with local customers, or collaborate with colleagues.

Our salary ranges are based on paying competitively for our size, stage and industry, and are one part of many compensation, benefits and other reward opportunities we provide.</p><p>There are many factors that go into salary determinations, including relevant experience, skill level and qualifications assessed during the interview process, and maintaining internal equity with peers on the team. The range shared below is a general expectation for the function as posted, but we are also open to considering candidates who may be more or less experienced than outlined in the job description. In this case, we will communicate any updates in the expected salary range.</p><p>Lastly, the provided range is the expected salary for candidates in the U.S. Outside of those regions, there may be a change in the range, which again, will be communicated to candidates.</p><p>Salary range: $195,000 - $250,000 OTE</p><p><p><strong><span>Working at AssemblyAI</span></strong></p><p>We are a small but mighty group of startup veterans and experienced AI researchers with over 20 years of expertise in Machine Learning, Speech Recognition, and NLP. As a fully remote team, we’re looking for people to join our team who are ambitious, curious, and lead with integrity. We’re still in the early days of AI and of AssemblyAI’s journey, and are looking for teammates who won’t just fit in, but will help us define and build our company culture.&nbsp;</p><p>We’re committed to creating a space where our employees can bring their full selves to work and have equal opportunity to succeed.

Our models serve 600M+ inference calls monthly, process 1M+ hours of audio daily, and power 2 billion+ end-user experiences—from voice agents and meeting assistants to contact centers and medical scribes. Companies like Zoom, Granola, Fireflies, Cluely, and Calabrio rely on AssemblyAI to ship production-ready voice AI.</p><p>We're at an inflection point in Speech AI. We released Universal-Streaming in mid-2025, and it has quickly earned its place as the model offering the best accuracy-latency-cost tradeoff on the market. Our research team drives these advances and ships with relentless velocity. Since releasing Universal-Streaming, we've already launched keyterms prompting feature and multilingual support—with more significant improvements on the roadmap.</p><p>We've raised $115M+ from Accel, Insight Partners, Y Combinator's AI Fund, Patrick and John Collison, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross. We're a remote team building one of the next great AI companies—and we're looking for researchers who will shape its future.</p></div><b><strong>About the Role:</strong></b><p>We're looking for an Applied AI Engineer to join our team at the intersection of cutting-edge AI research and real-world customer applications.
