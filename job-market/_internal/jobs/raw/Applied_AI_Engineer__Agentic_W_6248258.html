By 2028, more candidates will use AI assistants like ChatGPT and Perplexity to discover and apply for jobs — fundamentally changing how talent and employers connect. Built In is the first to build for this new reality, giving companies the ability to understand and influence how they appear in AI-driven search.</p><p>Our platform already reaches millions of tech professionals each month, and our 1,800+ customers — from startups to Fortune 100 companies — rely on us to tell authentic stories, showcase opportunities, and attract top talent. With our newest AI-powered tools, we’re evolving Built In into a data-rich, reputation-driven platform that’s shaping the future of hiring</p><p><strong>What You’ll Be a Part Of </strong></p><p>Built In is 14 years strong but operates with the energy and pace of a startup. We ship fast, learn constantly, and build with purpose. As an engineer here, you’ll have the chance to design and deliver products at the intersection of AI, reputation, and search — directly influencing how millions of professionals and thousands of companies connect.</p><p>You’ll join a team that values curiosity, accountability, and being good humans first. Our engineering culture is rooted in collaboration, trust, and continuous improvement.</p><p>If you want to build products that matter, shape how AI transforms the future of work, and make a visible impact inside a company that’s redefining its category — this is the opportunity for you</p><b><strong>We’re looking for an Applied AI Engineer</strong></b><p>We're seeking an experienced Applied AI Engineer to design and develop intelligent, agentic systems that take action on behalf of users. You’ll work at the intersection of AI automation and user experience—building conversational UIs and AI-driven workflows that solve real-world problems with minimal user input.</p><p>This is an ideal role for someone who’s passionate about Large Language Models (LLMs), intelligent agents, and the future of user interaction. You’ll have the opportunity to shape how AI behaves autonomously within product ecosystems.</p><b><strong>How you’ll contribute</strong></b><ul><li>Architect and build agentic workflows that can interpret intent, plan tasks, and execute operations on behalf of users.</li><li>Develop and iterate on chat-based user interfaces for rich, dynamic interactions.</li><li>Leverage LLM platforms (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) and orchestration tools like LangChain, Semantic Kernel, or custom frameworks.</li><li>Work cross-functionally with backend engineers, product managers, and designers to integrate conversational features into the platform.</li><li>Design robust systems for evaluating agent performance, user feedback loops, and improving reliability.</li><li>Stay current with cutting-edge developments in LLM tools, RAG pipelines, memory/state handling, and prompt engineering.</li></ul><b><strong>What you need</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></b><ul><li>4+ years in a Data Science, Machine Learning, or Applied AI role</li><li>Deep experience with Python, LLM APIs, and libraries like transformers, langchain, OpenAI, etc.</li><li>Experience building chatbots or conversational UIs, and strong understanding of natural language processing</li><li>Solid grasp of SQL, APIs, and structured/semi-structured data</li><li>Familiarity with vector databases, tool use orchestration, and agent memory design</li><li>Excellent collaboration and communication skills, especially in cross-functional teams</li><li>Bonus: experience in reinforcement learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or AI monitoring systems</li></ul><b><strong>Why Work With Us</strong></b><ul><li>Help shape intelligent systems that act autonomously in real-world environments</li><li>Be part of a product-led, engineering-driven culture</li><li>Remote-first team with collaborative, flexible work structure</li><li>Opportunities for leadership and technical ownership in AI development</li></ul><b><strong>What We Value</strong></b><p><span>W</span><span>e’re revolutionizing tech recruitment. So we</span><span> question everything, because the best answers sit just to the right of a question mark. That’s our heritage as a disruptive company — as a company whose future depends on our capacity to innovate with a sense of drive, purpose and urgency. If you join Built In, you will work from this set of values:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><strong>Be Inclusive, Always</strong><span>. We’re committed to a culture where all people are respected, have a say and can be their whole selves. We will uplift and advocate for one another. Always.</span></li><li><strong>Be Unreasonably Passionate. </strong><span>Our passion is borderline obsessive, and we’re ok with that. No one ever built anything great on a “meh.” We work with outsized passion to fulfill our mission.</span></li><li><strong>Be Humble. </strong><span>You don’t have all the answers. Luckily, you don’t have to. Don’t worry about being right. Be humble instead.&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong>Stay Curious. </strong><span>Curiosity is a springboard to the future. It can transform the wisp of an idea into a breakthrough. We ask “what if.” We work with wonder. It’s how we innovate.</span></li><li><strong>Lead with Solutions. </strong><span>Question everything. But offer solutions as you do. Raise issues. But propose a few answers. For every hole you poke, offer a way to patch it up.&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong>Own the Result. </strong><span>We have no time for blame or shame. When you stumble, own it, learn from it + get back to business.&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong>Do More. </strong><span>Do more than your job description. Take initiative. Take charge. No job is beneath you, and no job is too big. Be a leader and do more — do whatever it takes.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><b><strong>Be Inclusive, Always</strong></b><p><span>Research shows that women and other marginalized groups tend to apply to roles only when they check every point on a job description. We encourage you to apply if you meet the majority of qualifications and this role is aligned with your career trajectory.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Built In is an equal employment opportunity employer.&nbsp; Qualified candidates are considered for employment without regard to race, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, age, military or veteran status, disability, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.</span></p><p><span>Built In is guided by principles of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). We are committed to this work over the long-term, but here’s some of what’s in place today:</span></p><ul><li><span>We have three thriving ERG groups: BuiltOut, United We Parent and Women United in Tech.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>We are proud to be led by a woman CEO and founder, and that more than half of our managers and employees identify as women</span></li></ul><p><em><span>NOTE: BUILT IN </span></em><strong><em>NEVER CONTACTS</em></strong><em><span> JOB APPLICANTS VIA TEXT, MESSENGER OR OTHER SIMILAR APPLICATIONS.

That’s our heritage as a disruptive company — as a company whose future depends on our capacity to innovate with a sense of drive, purpose and urgency. If you join Built In, you will work from this set of values:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><strong>Be Inclusive, Always</strong><span>. We’re committed to a culture where all people are respected, have a say and can be their whole selves. We will uplift and advocate for one another. Always.</span></li><li><strong>Be Unreasonably Passionate. </strong><span>Our passion is borderline obsessive, and we’re ok with that. No one ever built anything great on a “meh.” We work with outsized passion to fulfill our mission.</span></li><li><strong>Be Humble. </strong><span>You don’t have all the answers. Luckily, you don’t have to. Don’t worry about being right. Be humble instead.&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong>Stay Curious. </strong><span>Curiosity is a springboard to the future. It can transform the wisp of an idea into a breakthrough. We ask “what if.” We work with wonder. It’s how we innovate.</span></li><li><strong>Lead with Solutions. </strong><span>Question everything. But offer solutions as you do. Raise issues. But propose a few answers. For every hole you poke, offer a way to patch it up.&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong>Own the Result. </strong><span>We have no time for blame or shame. When you stumble, own it, learn from it + get back to business.&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong>Do More. </strong><span>Do more than your job description. Take initiative. Take charge. No job is beneath you, and no job is too big. Be a leader and do more — do whatever it takes.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><b><strong>Be Inclusive, Always</strong></b><p><span>Research shows that women and other marginalized groups tend to apply to roles only when they check every point on a job description. We encourage you to apply if you meet the majority of qualifications and this role is aligned with your career trajectory.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Built In is an equal employment opportunity employer.&nbsp; Qualified candidates are considered for employment without regard to race, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, age, military or veteran status, disability, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law.</span></p><p><span>Built In is guided by principles of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).
