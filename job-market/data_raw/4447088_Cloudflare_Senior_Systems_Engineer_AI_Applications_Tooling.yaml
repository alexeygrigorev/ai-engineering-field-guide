  Preferred Location: Lisbon, Portugal | London, UK Other
  Locations: Austin, TX About the Role  We are building a new,
  high-impact team of AI application experts to define, drive,
  and develop our AI solutions, from AI observability to
  autonomous intelligent agents. As a Senior AI Engineer, you
  will be instrumental in defining Cloudflare's AI strategy,
  leading critical projects such as LLM-powered code
  generation, AI observability, and edge-optimized model
  inference. This role requires bringing cutting-edge AI
  capabilities to our developer platform and will involve
  setting the technical direction for high-performance,
  scalable AI applications that push the boundaries of what's
  possible on the web. About the Department Our team is part
  of Cloudflare's Emerging Technology and Incubation (ETI)
  team where new, bold products are built and released within
  Cloudflare. Rather than being constrained by the structures
  which make Cloudflare a successful business, ETI leverages
  our network to deliver entirely new tools and products to
  our customers. Our most successful endeavors include the
  Cloudflare development platform, which is composed of
  Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects, R2, D1, and many other
  developer products. What you'll do As a Senior member of the
  AI Applications team, you will own and strategically shape
  the future of AI-powered applications on our platform. You
  will work across Cloudflare's stack, collaborating with
  teams to define, build, and optimize mission-critical AI
  solutions that enhance developer experience, security, and
  performance. To this end, you will:
  
  - Lead the development of high-impact AI-powered tools and
    integrations that enhance the developer experience, such
    as AI-assisted code generation and debugging.
  - Design, architect, and implement AI observability solutions
    to improve model monitoring, explainability, and
    performance optimization at scale.
  - Drive cross-functional efforts to integrate AI into
    Cloudflare's developer platform, ensuring optimal
    scalability and efficiency.
  - Mentor and champion best practices, engaging with the
    broader AI and developer community, contributing to open-
    source projects, technical documentation, and blog posts.
  - Work across Cloudflare's ecosystem to identify and evaluate
    new AI opportunities, influence technical direction, and
    drive adoption of AI technologies.
  - If applicable to ongoing projects, you may also participate
    in an on-call rotation to support critical AI-powered
    services.
  
   Minimum Requirements
  
  - 5+ years of professional experience in software engineering,
    with significant focus on building and deploying AI
    applications in a production environment.
  - Proven experience in building and optimizing AI
    applications, with a deep understanding of LLMs, model
    inference, and AI-powered developer tools.
  - Expertise in tackling complex debugging challenges,
    optimizing AI workloads, and working with large-scale
    distributed systems.
  
   About you  We want you to love it here! This role is a good
  fit for you if you are:
  
  - Excited by the idea of defining Cloudflare's AI strategy and
    bringing cutting-edge AI capabilities to developers.
  - Comfortable leading complex initiatives and working across
    Cloudflare's stack, from backend services to edge
    computing, with a focus on scalability and efficiency.
  - Passionate about setting standards for integrating AI into
    developer workflows and improving model monitoring
    practices.
  - A strong collaborator and mentor, who values support, open
    dialogue, and high standards while celebrating successes
    and learning from challenges.
  - Excited to own your work from early discussions to
    production, and to guide collaboration with teams across
    Cloudflare to make AI more accessible and effective.
  - Naturally curious and eager to learn new technologies,
    experiment with AI applications, and share your findings
    to elevate the team's knowledge.
  
   You'll really feel at home if you have:
  
  - Experience leading projects building LLM-powered
    applications, developer tools, or agent frameworks.
  - Familiarity with Cloudflare's developer platform, edge
    computing, or AI inference.
  - Experience contributing to open-source LLM or developer
    tools projects.
  - Public speaking or developer advocacy experience in the AI
    or software engineering space.
