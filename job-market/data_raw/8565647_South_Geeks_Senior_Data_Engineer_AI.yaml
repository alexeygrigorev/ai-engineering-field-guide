  Hi there :)
  
  Thanks for checking in to find out about our open position.
  We´ll provide as much information as possible, but please
  feel free to reach us if you have further questions. We´ll
  be happy to see your application, even if there are skills
  you don't quite master!
  
  About Us
  
  At South Geeks, we connect top LATAM engineering talent with
  innovative companies building impactful products worldwide.
  We focus on long-term partnerships, strong technical
  environments, and creating spaces where professionals can
  grow, contribute, and thrive.
  
  About the Client
  
  Our client is a real estate technology startup transforming
  how commercial real estate teams negotiate and manage leases
  through AI-driven intelligence.
  
  Their platform combines advanced AI, structured data
  pipelines, and user-centered design to automate complex
  lease workflows, extract market-aligned insights, and
  streamline proposal generation. The goal is to bring speed,
  clarity and data-backed confidence to the entire deal
  lifecycle.
  
  About the Role
  
  We’re looking for a Senior Data Engineer who thrives at the
  intersection of data engineering and applied AI.
  
  This is a hands-on, high-ownership role where you will
  design, build and operate systems that extract, transform,
  and validate structured data from complex leasing documents.
  You will own the full ELT loop turning messy, real-world
  documents into clean, reliable JSON that powers web
  applications and downstream systems.
  
  In this early-stage environment, iteration and agility are
  key. You’ll scope ambiguous problems, experiment with AI-
  driven extraction techniques, and continuously refine
  pipelines to improve accuracy and scalability.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Design and iterate data extraction and transformation
    pipelines that convert unstructured leasing documents into
    structured JSON stores.
  - Write and optimize LLM API calls and prompts to extract and
    interpret text data at scale.
  - Orchestrate AI-driven workflows integrating multiple LLM
    models to handle diverse document types and edge cases.
  - Build and maintain ELT workflows in Python, managing data
    flows between cloud storage and relational databases.
  - Develop data quality and validation frameworks to ensure
    structured outputs are accurate and production-ready.
  - Implement monitoring, alerting, and automated quality checks
    across extraction pipelines.
  - Collaborate with product and engineering teams to define and
    evolve data schemas.
  - Own the pipeline end-to-end — from raw ingestion to
    validated structured output.
  
  Required Skills & Experience
  
  - Strong Python engineering experience building data
    extraction and transformation workflows.
  - Experience calling LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, or similar)
    and crafting prompts for structured data extraction.
  - Solid understanding of ELT patterns and data pipeline
    architecture.
  - Experience working with AWS S3 (or similar object storage)
    and PostgreSQL (or similar relational databases).
  - Experience designing JSON schemas and handling nested or
    semi-structured data.
  - Strong data validation mindset and experience implementing
    quality controls.
  - Ability to work independently in a fast-moving, early-stage
    environment.
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Experience building document processing pipelines (PDFs,
    contracts, leases, or similar).
  - Experience evaluating and comparing LLM outputs for
    consistency and accuracy.
  - Familiarity with AI orchestration platforms.
  - Background in real estate, leasing, or financial document
    processing.

  We strive to create an inspiring and growth-oriented
  environment where everyone feels valued, heard, and
