  Senior Software Engineer — Agentic AI Platform
  
  Location: Remote Employment Type: Full-time Compensation:
  Competitive
  
  Our client is building the future of intelligent
  infrastructure automation through agentic AI. They are
  seeking a Senior Backend Engineer to help design and build
  the systems that power an AI-driven automation platform used
  by enterprise IT teams and managed service providers
  worldwide.
  
  This is a high-impact, zero-to-one engineering role focused
  on building backend foundations for large-scale AI
  orchestration. You will work on distributed systems that
  combine traditional infrastructure automation with large
  language models (LLMs), retrieval-augmented generation
  (RAG), and intelligent agents.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Design and implement backend services that enable
    intelligent agent workflows and autonomous infrastructure
    actions
  - Develop APIs and orchestration layers in Python and
    TypeScript, integrating LLMs, vector databases, and
    observability pipelines
  - Build scalable systems to support LLM-based reasoning,
    retrieval, and decision-making across cloud infrastructure
  - Integrate with AWS Bedrock and other LLM platforms to
    support multi-model capabilities
  - Develop data access and semantic search layers using vector
    databases (e.g., pgvector, Pinecone, Qdrant)
  - Build robust monitoring, testing, and CI/CD systems to
    ensure reliability and reproducibility of AI workflows
  - Collaborate closely with Product and DevOps teams to design
    architecture diagrams, plan deployments, and monitor
    system health
  - Write clean, maintainable code with clear documentation and
    strong adherence to security and performance best
    practices
  - Participate in code reviews, design discussions, and
    iterative delivery cycles to improve product velocity and
    quality
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - 6+ years of backend engineering experience in production
    environments
  - Strong proficiency in Python and TypeScript for building
    distributed, event-driven systems
  - Deep understanding of AWS services (Lambda, ECS, Bedrock,
    S3, CloudWatch, etc.)
  - Experience designing APIs, microservices, and event
    pipelines that interface with LLMs or AI models
  - Familiarity with vector databases and concepts such as
    embeddings, similarity search, and retrieval-augmented
    generation
  - Experience with infrastructure-as-code tools such as
    Terraform or AWS CDK
  - Strong understanding of SQL and schema migration workflows
    (PostgreSQL or similar)
  - Hands-on experience with Docker, GitHub Actions, and cloud-
    native CI/CD workflows
  - Ability to diagram systems, communicate architecture
    decisions clearly, and work effectively in a distributed
    team
  - Strong ownership mindset and ability to deliver in fast-
    moving, ambiguous environments
  
  Bonus Points
  
  - Experience working with LangChain, OpenAI, or Anthropic APIs
  - Familiarity with agentic frameworks or AI orchestration
    systems
  - Background in observability or APM tooling (e.g., Datadog,
    Dynatrace)
  - Prior experience building automation or infrastructure
    management tools
  - Contributions to open-source LLM or MLOps projects
  - Interest in applying AI to real-world IT operations
  
  Why Join
  
  You’ll be joining a globally distributed, high-performing
  team focused on redefining how enterprises manage
  infrastructure. Every feature you build will directly impact
  how engineers interact with intelligent systems in
  production environments.
  
  This is an opportunity to help architect the foundation of a
  platform that blends infrastructure automation, AI, and
  agentic reasoning — where your technical decisions will
  shape the next generation of enterprise operations.
