  About Us Symbolica is an AI research lab pioneering the
  application of category theory to enable logical reasoning
  in machines. We’re a well-resourced, nimble team of experts
  on a mission to bridge the gap between theoretical
  mathematics and cutting-edge technologies, creating symbolic
  reasoning models that think like humans – precise, logical,
  and interpretable. While others focus on scaling data-hungry
  neural networks, we’re building AI that understands the
  structures of thought, not just patterns in data.
  
  Our approach combines rigorous research with fast-paced,
  results-driven execution. We’re reimagining the very
  foundations of intelligence while simultaneously developing
  product-focused machine learning models in a tight feedback
  loop, where research fuels application.
  
  Founded in 2022, we’ve raised over $30M from leading Silicon
  Valley investors, including Khosla Ventures, General
  Catalyst, Abstract Ventures, and Day One Ventures, to push
  the boundaries of applying formal mathematics and logic to
  machine learning.
  
  Our vision is to create AI systems that transform
  industries, empowering machines to solve humanity’s most
  complex challenges with precision and insight. Join us to
  redefine the future of AI by turning groundbreaking ideas
  into reality.
  
  About the role We’re looking for a Python Software Engineer
  to take full ownership of building and shipping the core
  systems that power Symbolica’s applied AI products. This is
  a true generalist role: you’ll work across our SDK,
  developer libraries, server-side platform, integrations with
  inference providers, and applied AI features such as agent
  engineering, per-model optimizations, and context tuning.
  
  
  
  Your work will directly shape the developer and user
  experience — from designing clean APIs and libraries that
  customers use every day, to building the backend systems and
  integrations that make it all reliable at scale. You’ll be
  the bridge between research prototypes and production-
  quality systems, helping turn cutting-edge ideas into tools
  that developers love.
  
  
  
  📍 This is an onsite role based in our London office (66 City
  Rd).
  
  
  
  Your focus
  
  - Build, maintain, and improve Python-based systems across the
    stack: SDK, libraries, APIs, server-side platform, and
    integration layers.
  - Work on applied AI engineering, including per-model
    optimisations, context tuning, and agent-related features.
  - Design developer-facing tools and libraries that customers
    can use directly.
  - Integrate with external inference providers to ensure
    reliability and scalability.
  - Own projects end-to-end: clarify requirements, design,
    implement, test, and ship production-ready code.
  - Collaborate with ML researchers and engineers to turn
    prototypes into robust, usable systems.
  - Contribute to architecture discussions, code reviews, and
    best practices for building maintainable software.
  - Continuously improve developer experience and system
    performance.
  
  About you
  
  - 4+ years of professional software engineering experience,
    with Python as your primary language.
  - Strong track record of delivering production-quality systems
    end-to-end.
  - Proven ability to work from incomplete specs and drive
    projects to completion.
  - High standards for code quality, testing, maintainability,
    and performance.
  - Experience with ML infrastructure, applied AI systems, or
    developer tooling is a big plus.
  - Thrive in fast-moving, ambiguous environments where
    priorities shift quickly.
  - Ownership mindset: you see what needs doing and take
    responsibility for delivery.
  
  What we offer
  
  - Competitive salary and early-stage equity package
  - A high-trust, execution-first culture with minimal
    bureaucracy
  - Direct ownership of meaningful projects with real business
    impact
  - A rare opportunity to sit at the interface between deep
    research and real-world productisation
  
  We are able to sponsor a Skilled Worker visa for qualified
  candidates applying to this position. This specific role
  exceeds the minimum salary threshold set by the UK
  government for Skilled Worker visa sponsorship. Please note
  that English language proficiency at B2 level or higher is
  required for this role.
  
  Symbolica is an equal opportunities employer. We celebrate
  diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive
  environment for all employees, regardless of race, gender,
  age, religion, disability, or sexual orientation.
