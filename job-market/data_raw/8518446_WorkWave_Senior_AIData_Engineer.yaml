title: Senior AI/Data Engineer
company: WorkWave
location: USA
work_type: FULL_TIME
level: Expert/Leader
description: |
  We’re looking for a customer-centric Senior AI/Data Engineer
  to build and scale data systems that drive our “decision
  intelligence” products. You’ll work at the intersection of
  data engineering, product development, and AI/ML
  enablement—designing systems that empower customer-facing
  data products. This role requires not only deep technical
  expertise but also a strategic mindset, strong communication
  skills, and a high sense of ownership over how data supports
  the business. You will collaborate across teams to ensure
  data is a true product enabler.
  
  WHAT YOU'LL DO:
  
  Engineering & AI Enablement
  
  - AI/ML ownership: Build trusted AI/ML predictions and
    forecasts via feature pipelines, model input/output data
    flows, and robust data validation frameworks.
  - Pipeline Design: Design and implement reliable, scalable,
    and secure data pipelines that serve analytical and
    product use cases.
  - Leadership: Provide technical leadership and mentorship to
    other data engineers and cross-functional collaborators,
    fostering a culture of engineering excellence.
  
  Ecosystem Ownership & Strategy
  
  - Architecture & Evolution: Own the architecture and evolution
    of our data platform, ensuring it meets the performance,
    scalability, and agility needs of our growing business.
  - Governance & Observability: Implement data governance,
    quality, and observability best practices to ensure
    trustworthy insights, proactively managing data health
    before it impacts the business.
  - Infrastructure Optimization: Optimize cloud data
    infrastructure for cost, performance, and maintainability,
    treating the platform as a product rather than just a
    utility.
  
  Collaboration & Translation
  
  - Cross-Functional Partnership: Collaborate closely with
    product managers, engineers, and customer stakeholders to
    understand context and needs, and help translate them into
    engineering solutions.
  - Customer-Centricity: Ensure engineering efforts are aligned
    with delivering clear business value and enhancing the
    customer experience.
  
  WHO YOU ARE:
  
  - The ML Enabler: You are a Data Engineer who loves the
    complexity of AI. You understand that a model is only as
    good as the pipeline feeding it, and you take pride in
    building the infrastructure that brings AI to life.
  - The Product-Minded Architect: You don’t just move data from
    A to B; you build systems with the end-user in mind. You
    prioritize "Time to Insight" and usability as much as you
    prioritize code efficiency.
  - The Strategic Owner: You are comfortable working in an
    environment where you are expected to identify problems
    and fix them without waiting for a ticket. You view the
    data ecosystem as your product.
  - We know that great talent comes from many backgrounds. If
    you are a builder who cares about the "why" behind the
    code, we want to hear from you!
  
  WHAT YOU’LL BRING:
  
  - Experience: 5+ years of experience in data engineering, with
    1–2+ years in a senior or lead capacity.
  - Deep Technical Expertise: You possess a profound
    understanding of ML models and can articulate the trade-
    offs between different architectures (e.g., complexity vs.
    inference speed, accuracy vs. interpretability) to ensure
    the right tool is selected for the job.
  - Coding: "Ninja-level" proficiency in Python for complex data
    structures and automation, alongside strong SQL expertise.
  - ML Frameworks: Strong familiarity with Scikit-Learn and
    similar libraries, with specific experience building and
    maintaining associated feature engineering pipelines.
  - Ops & Orchestration: High proficiency in MLOps practices and
    orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow, dbt, Dagster) to
    manage model lifecycles and data dependencies.
  - Modern Data Stack: Solid experience with modern data
    platforms (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, or
    Databricks).
  - Cloud & Modeling: Strong understanding of data modeling,
    performance optimization, and cloud computing (AWS, GCP,
    or Azure).
  - Communication: Excellent communication and collaboration
    skills, with a proven ability to work effectively across
    technical and non-technical teams.
