  Job Summary:
  
  We are seeking a Senior AI Engineer – Agentic Platform Lead
  to serve as one of the senior technical leaders for the
  Agentic Computational Engineering (ACE) team. In this role,
  you will architect and build the multi-agent platform,
  execution environment, and core services that allow AI
  agents to design complex hardware systems end-to-end.
  
  You will own the technical roadmap for the ACE platform,
  lead a small team of exceptional engineers, and partner
  closely with domain experts across propulsion, electronics,
  and manufacturing. This role is ideal for a builder who is
  obsessed with velocity, comfortable in ambiguity, and
  excited to spend their days turning cutting-edge AI research
  into hard industrial capability. You are the kind of
  engineer who uses AI as leverage, not a novelty, and who
  views waiting on slow tools as a bug in the system to be
  eliminated.
  
  You will be joining the Agentic Computational Engineering
  (ACE) team, a specialized group within our Advanced
  Technology Development organization. ACE is responsible for
  building Voyager’s Generative Engine – the AI-native
  platform that compresses complex hardware development cycles
  from years to days. We design agentic AI systems that pair
  deeply with physics simulation, test data, and modern
  manufacturing so that Design for Manufacturing (DfM), Design
  for Assembly (DfA), and Design for Test (DfT) are built into
  the very first line of code and the very first sketch of a
  design.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Architect and own the full stack ACE platform for the
    Generative Engine, including agent orchestration,
    execution runtimes, and frontend and backend services.
  - Design and implement distributed systems patterns (e.g.,
    orchestrator–worker, swarms) that coordinate AI agents
    across the full hardware design lifecycle.
  - Build the secure execution layer where agents can
    autonomously run code, simulations, and analyses against
    internal tools and data sources.
  - Design and implement memory, context, and provenance systems
    (RAG, vector stores, decision logs) so agents can recall
    and justify prior design decisions.
  - Aggressively profile and optimize system performance, with a
    focus on latency, reliability, and observability for large
    numbers of concurrent agents.
  - Lead and mentor a small team of exceptional engineers,
    scientists, and/or mathematicians setting standards,
    reviewing code, and growing early-career talent.
  - Collaborate with domain teams (electronics, propulsion,
    manufacturing) to translate their workflows into scalable
    agentic capabilities on the platform.
  - Influence long-range technical strategy for ACE and help
    define how agentic AI is used across Voyager’s engineering
    stack.
  
  Required Qualifications:
  
  - Master’s degree + 5 years, or PhD + 3 years, in Computer
    Science, Physics, Mathematics, or a related technical
    field; or equivalent practical experience.
  - 5+ years of experience building production-grade backend or
    distributed systems in high-throughput or mission-critical
    environments.
  - Deep experience with modern programming languages such as
    Python, Go, or Rust, and with microservice architectures,
    message buses, and containerization.
  - Hands-on experience building or integrating LLM-based
    systems, including agent orchestration frameworks (e.g.,
    LangGraph, AutoGen, custom runtimes).
  - Demonstrated “AI-first” workflow: you routinely use LLMs and
    agents to accelerate coding, documentation, and testing
    and have examples of where this 10×’d your output.
  - Proven ability to lead technical projects, mentor other
    engineers, and make architectural decisions in a fast-
    paced, highly ambiguous environment.
  
  Preferred Qualifications:
  
  - Background or minor in Mechanical, Aerospace, Electrical
    Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, or Applied Mathematics.
  - Experience designing systems that connect AI agents to
    engineering tools (e.g., Ansys, Altium, CAD/CAE platforms)
    and internal services.
  - Experience with observability stacks (logging, tracing,
    metrics) for complex distributed systems.
  - Prior experience building platforms that support safety-
    critical or mission-critical applications at companies
    like SpaceX.
  - A track record of personal projects or open-source work that
    shows your passion for building systems, not just doing a
    job.
  
  Voyager offers a comprehensive, total compensation package,
  which includes competitive salary, a discretionary annual
  bonus plan, paid time off (PTO), a comprehensive health
  benefit package, retirement savings, wellness program, and
  various other benefits. When you join our team, you’re not
  just an employee; you become part of a dynamic community
  dedicated to innovation and excellence.
  
  To conform to U.S. Government space technology export
  regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms
  Regulations (ITAR) you must be a U.S. citizen, lawful
  permanent resident of the U.S., protected individual as
  defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3), or eligible to obtain the
  required authorizations from the U.S. Department of State.
  
  Voyager is an Equal Opportunity Employer. Employment
  decisions are made without regard to race, color, religion,
  national or ethnic origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender
  identity or expression, age, disability, protected veteran
  status or other characteristics protected by law.
