  Job Purpose
  
  We are seeking a highly motivated and skilled AI Engineer to
  join our team and drive innovation in the fast-evolving
  landscape of Generative AI. The ideal candidate will have
  deep hands-on expertise in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation) pipelines and working familiarity with Frontier
  Models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, etc.). Exposure to
  cutting-edge orchestration frameworks like CrewAI,
  LangGraph, Autogen, or OpenAI SDK is highly desirable.
  
  You will work closely with product, data, and engineering
  teams to prototype, build, and scale AI-first solutions that
  deliver tangible business impact. Strong communication
  skills are key, as you’ll be working with cross-functional
  teams and occasionally interfacing with clients.

  - Design and implement scalable RAG pipelines to enable
    contextual, high-quality responses using enterprise
    knowledge bases.
  - Evaluate and integrate Frontier LLMs /Open source LLM and
    APIs for specific tasks, ensuring optimal performance and
    efficiency.
  - Build autonomous agent workflows using tools like CrewAI,
    LangGraph, Autogen, or OpenAI SDK.
  - Develop and optimize prompts, chains, and multi-agent
    systems.
  - Stay updated on the latest in the GenAI ecosystem and make
    recommendations for internal adoption.
  - Collaborate with stakeholders to understand use cases,
    define solution architectures, and iterate prototypes into
    production-ready systems.
  - Ensure responsible AI practices, including data privacy,
    model explainability, andcompliance.
  
  Required Skills & Experience
  
  - 6 to 7 years of overall industry experience with at least
    1–2 years in Generative AI /LLM-focused projects.
  - Strong understanding of Frontier LLMs and their application
    across domains.
  - Hands-on experience in IDE’s such as Cursor
  - Hands-on experience building Retrieval-Augmented Generation
    systems using vector databases (like FAISS, Weaviate, or
    Pinecone).
  - Working knowledge of CrewAI, LangGraph, Autogen, or similar
    agent orchestration frameworks.
  - Proficiency in Python, with experience using libraries like
    LangChain, Transformers, and OpenAI SDKs.
  - Familiarity with API integrations, asynchronous task
    handling, and cloud-nativedeployment (Azure).
  - Excellent problem-solving and analytical skills.
  - Strong written and verbal communication skills.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Exposure to US Healthcare systems, data formats (FHIR, HL7),
    or domain-specific use cases is a plus.
  - Experience in fine-tuning or evaluating LLMs using domain-
    specific corpora.
  - Understanding of security and compliance requirements in
    regulated industries.
