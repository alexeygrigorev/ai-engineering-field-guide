  for online communities. We make it possible for creators,

  their own brand.
  
  We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and
  growing!) team members from 30+ countries around the world.
  We seek exceptional individuals around the world, set them
  up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn, create a
  meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours,
  but we do manage for high expectations very closely. We
  collaborate across time zones, are highly async, and like to
  document a lot.

  Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still

  About the role
  
  The Applied AI team at Circle is at the forefront of
  leveraging AI to drive innovation for our customers through
  transformative applications of large language models (LLMs).
  We build AI-powered features for our customers — AI agents,
  AI workflows, and AI copilot. As we scale these features to
  more customers, we're investing in robust infrastructure for
  measuring, diagnosing, and improving AI system speed and
  performance.
  
  We're looking for a strong AI Platform Engineer to help
  establish the foundation for this layer. This is a new focus
  area for us, with this being the first AI platform engineer
  hire at Circle. You’ll have significant ownership in shaping
  how we approach it. This role focuses on production AI
  systems — building infrastructure to measure and improve
  them— rather than ML research or model training. If you're
  excited about making AI systems work reliably at scale, this
  is for you.
  
  You'll build evaluation frameworks, observability tooling,
  and diagnostic infrastructure that tells us whether our AI
  systems are working well and helps identify where and how to
  improve them. When you find gaps, you'll prototype
  solutions, validate them with data, and work with the team
  to implement these improvements.
  
  What you'll be doing
  
  - Build evaluation infrastructure to measure AI system speed
    and accuracy — both offline (during development) and
    online (in production).
  - Create observability tooling and dashboards that surface
    quality metrics week-over-week.
  - Diagnose quality gaps. When accuracy drops, trace whether
    it's retrieval, ranking, prompting, or something else
    causing the issue.
  - Experiment with different models and agent configurations,
    using data to guide decisions.
  - Prototype and validate improvements to our RAG pipeline —
    chunking strategies, retrieval methods, re-ranking
    approaches.
  - Analyze how our customers are using our AI features to help
    us identify improvements or new areas for development.
  - Work closely with other engineers to give them confidence
    that their changes improve quality.
  - Help us stay up-to-date with the cutting-edge AI research,
    techniques, and tools.
  
  What you'll need to be successful
  
  - Experience building and evaluating AI systems in production
    — including RAG pipelines, search / retrieval systems,
    LLM-powered applications, and both offline and LLM-based
    evaluation frameworks.
  - Strong proficiency in Python for prototyping and
    experimentation.
  - Openness to learning Ruby on Rails — our production system
    is built in Rails, and you'll need to integrate with and
    instrument the existing codebase.
  - Comfortable building infrastructure and tooling (eval
    pipelines, dashboards, data processing).
  - Deep understanding of RAG architecture: chunking strategies,
    embeddings, retrieval, re-ranking, context management.
  - Strong experimentation mindset — you’re comfortable
    designing and running A/B tests, measuring results, and
    iterating quickly to discover what works and what doesn’t.
  - Strong data analysis skills — you can interpret results,
    identify patterns, and communicate findings clearly.
  - A desire to work in an environment which values speed of
    iteration and individual autonomy, while also embracing
    personal accountability and the ability to collaborate
    effectively as part of a dynamic team.
  - Comfortable in a fast-paced environment with a certain level
    of ambiguity, especially when learning and picking up new
    technologies when projects require it.
  - Strong alignment with our values, find our values on our
    career page if you haven’t read up on them yet.
  - You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading)
    at a CEFR Level C2 / ILR Level 5.
  
  Bonus Points
  
  - Experience with evaluation frameworks (Braintrust,
    LangSmith, or similar).
  
  $130,000 - $140,000 USD per year
  
  The cash compensation range shown is a starting point. In
  addition to equity, benefits and perks, your cash
  compensation is subject to an annual review and increase on
  a once per year basis.
  
  The fun stuff
  
  - Fully remote: work from anywhere in the world!
  - Autonomy and trust to do your job: we care about outcomes
    over everything else.
  - Paid time away: all employees are given 35 days of PTO
    annually. We also offer a paid sabbatical after 5 years.
  - Generous U.S. benchmarked compensation and startup equity no
    matter where you are in the world.*
  - Awesome medical coverage with 100% coverage for you and your
    family, or medical reimbursement options where
    applicable!*
  - Parental leave for parents expanding their family, or just
    starting one.
  - Home office stipend to help you get up and running.
  - Learning & development stipend to help you level up your
    professional skills.
  - Annual bonus potential for roles that don't already receive
    variable income or commission.
  - Company retreats: Twice a year, the Circle team gets
    together for a fully paid company retreat in incredible
    places around the world! We’ve had past retreats in
    Colombia, Portugal, and Mexico, with more planned on the
    horizon.
