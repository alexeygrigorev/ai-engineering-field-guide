  At Databricks, we are passionate about enabling data teams

  As a Senior Software Engineer on the Customer Foresight
  Team, you'll lead the development of products that customers
  use to get insights on their AI and data workloads, optimize
  their performance, and lower costs. You will build data
  infrastructure that processes billions of entries daily,
  deploy to over 65 cloud regions worldwide, and enable some
  of the world's biggest companies to conduct their DevOps,
  FinOps, SecOps and AIOps jobs.
  
  This role requires leading the technical development of
  product milestones from refinement of requirements, through
  execution, operation, and iterating with the broader product
  development team and partner teams to ensure product

    questions about their Databricks environment by providing
    a reliable and timely interface for observability
  - Make it easy for frameworks teams across Databricks to
    publish their data to customers
  - Effectively lead large milestones from the observability
    roadmap, contribute to the long-term vision and
    requirements development for Databricks products
  - Mentor other engineers towards contributing to the product
    and their career growth
  - Optimize the scalability and cost of large data pipelines
    towards reducing costs for customers and opening up new
    product opportunities
  - Drive integration with popular tools and services in the
    broader data warehousing ecosystem
  
  What we look for:
  
  - 6+ years of production level experience in one of: Java,
    Scala, Python, C++, or similar language
  - Experience with cloud technologies, e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP,
    Docker, Kubernetes
  - Proven track record in architecting, developing, deploying,
    and operating components of large scale distributed
    systems
  - Strong software engineering maturity: security, correctness,
    engineering excellence, operational excellence
  - Platform mindset: effective building platforms for other
    software teams, iterating quickly to reduce friction to
    adoption, advocating for platform use
  - Cross-functional skills: we have platform customers internal
    at Databricks as well as external customers, which
    requires strong cross-functional skills
