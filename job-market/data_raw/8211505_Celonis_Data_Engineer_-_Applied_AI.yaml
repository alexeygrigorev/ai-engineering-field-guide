  Product and Go-to-market organizations to drive adoption at
  scale.
  
  The Role:

    & distribute Celonis Data Model.
  - Collaborate closely with software engineering teams for
    requirements, timeline, and dependencies of content

  - Serve as the primary link for discussions between the
    Business Apps and Product & Engineering Team.
  - Test and validate the models in development environments and
    customer environments to gather early feedback.
  - Document the data model governing principles and development
  - Drive AI adoption to accelerate development and end-user
    adoption throughout the department

  - You have that rare combination - a strong technical
    expertise and business acumen. You’ll use this to expand
    our offering of pre-built data models that drive tangible
    customer value. .
