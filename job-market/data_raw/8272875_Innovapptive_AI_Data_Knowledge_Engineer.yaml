  MedicalJob Description About Us
  
  Innovapptive is a category-defining SaaS company building
  the world’s most advanced AI-powered Connected Worker
  Platform for the industrial sector. Headquartered in
  Houston, TX, and backed by Vista Equity Partners,
  Innovapptive is on a mission to reimagine how industrial
  work gets done — connecting frontline workers, back-office
  systems, and assets in real time to drive higher safety,
  reliability, and productivity.
  
  Our platform is trusted by some of the world’s largest
  enterprises — including Shell, Hess, Cenovus Energy,
  W.R.Grace, Westlake Chemicals, UNICEF, Kimberly Clark, Scott
  Miracle Gro, and Newmont Mining to name a few, and across
  chemicals, energy, mining, and manufacturing industries.
  These customers have achieved tangible, hard-dollar results,
  such as:
  
  - Over $40 million in annual EBITDA savings at a single
    enterprise.
  - 10× frontline productivity improvements through mobile-first
    and AI-enabled workflows.
  - 15–20% maintenance cost reductions and significant uptime
    gains across plants and sites.
  
  Innovapptive is recognized by leading industry analysts for
  its differentiated value creation model:
  
  - Named a Leader in the Frost & Sullivan Industrial Connected
    Worker Radar.
  - Featured by Gartner in “Connected Factory Worker” research
    and the Hype Cycle for Manufacturing Operations Strategy.
  - Cited by LNS Research for delivering 3–5× greater value than
    point solutions through unified OT–IT execution, AI/vision
    innovation, and field-proven ROI.
  
  Our growth is backed by Tiger Global Management and Vista
  Equity Partners, one of the world’s premier software
  investors, known for scaling high-performance SaaS
  companies. Together, we are building the next-generation AI
  Powered Connected Worker Platform, combining cutting-edge
  technologies — SLM’s, Generative AI, Computer Vision, and
  Intelligent Orchestration — into a unified system that
  transforms plant operations globally.
  
  Today, with over 300+ employees across the U.S., India, and
  ANZ, Innovapptive stands at a pivotal inflection point: with
  an ambition to scale to $100M ARR within the next 3-4 years
  by industrializing every aspect of our product, engineering,
  and customer delivery systems.
  
  The Role
  
  - The AI Data & Knowledge Engineer will architect and
    operationalize Innovapptive’s semantic data intelligence
    layer — building the pipelines, vector stores, and
    retrieval frameworks that supply contextual understanding
    to AI Agents and enterprise workflows.
  - Reporting to the VP of Technology & Architecture, this role
    is responsible for designing the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented
    Generation) and Vector Embedding pipelines that connect
    industrial data (SOPs, manuals, logs, SCADA readings, SAP
    records) with Innovapptive’s AI runtime.
  - This is a hands-on, cross-disciplinary engineering role,
    blending data architecture, ML engineering, and semantic
    search design to make Innovapptive’s AI Agents
    contextually aware, accurate, and reliable.
  
  How You Will Make An Impact
  
  1. Architect the AI Knowledge and Data Layer
  
  - Design and implement data ingestion and embedding pipelines
    to convert structured and unstructured content into
    vectorized representations.
  - Build a unified data schema connecting maintenance,
    production, and safety data across SAP, Maximo, OSI PI,
    and SCADA systems.
  - Integrate vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, or
    Chroma) into the AI Platform (MCP) to enable context-aware
    retrieval.
  - Optimize query efficiency and relevance through hybrid
    search (semantic + keyword) and metadata tagging.
  
  2. Operationalize RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
  
  - Implement document chunking, embedding, and retrieval
    pipelines for PDFs, work orders, shift logs, and incident
    reports.
  - Develop automated retraining and re-indexing mechanisms to
    ensure freshness of data.
  - Collaborate with AI Platform Architect to link retrieval
    flows into agent orchestration layers.
  - Validate precision, recall, and latency metrics for semantic
    retrieval using real production workloads.
  
  3. Build AI Data Governance and Observability
  
  - Define data lineage, quality metrics, and access control for
    AI knowledge repositories.
  - Embed telemetry for data latency, embedding drift, and
    retrieval accuracy into Datadog/Sentry dashboards.
  - Partner with the Chief AI Architect to enforce compliance,
    explainability, and prompt context versioning standards.
  
  4. Collaborate Across Product and Engineering
  
  - Work with Product Managers and Solution Architects to
    identify key use cases for AI-driven search and knowledge
    retrieval.
  - Partner with QA to build automated test frameworks for
    semantic accuracy and retrieval reliability.
  - Collaborate with industrial data teams to extract and
    normalize sensor, historian, and SAP data for RAG
    integration.
  
  5. Drive Continuous Innovation
  
  - Evaluate emerging frameworks for knowledge graphs,
    embeddings, and contextual caching (e.g., LlamaIndex,
    LangChain, FAISS).
  - Tune embeddings and hybrid retrieval strategies for domain-
    specific industrial vocabulary.
  - Mentor developers on data preparation and retrieval design
    for AI-integrated product features.
  
  What You Bring to The Team
  
  - 8 – 12 + years of data or ML engineering experience, with 3
    + years in semantic search, RAG, or vector database
    architecture.
  - Proficiency with Python, SQL, and frameworks such as
    LangChain, LlamaIndex, or Haystack.
  - Hands-on experience with vector databases (Pinecone,
    Weaviate, Qdrant, Chroma) and cloud data stores (AWS S3,
    DynamoDB, Redshift).
  - Deep understanding of embedding models (OpenAI, Cohere,
    Sentence Transformers) and performance tuning for large-
    scale retrieval.
  - Strong data pipeline experience (Airflow, Kafka, Temporal)
    and understanding of MLOps fundamentals.
  - Familiarity with industrial data (SAP, Maximo, OSI PI,
    SCADA, MES) preferred.
  - Excellent communication and documentation skills — able to
    translate data architecture into business and engineering
    language.
  
  Success Metrics (FIRST 90-180 Days)
  
  - Vector Data Layer deployed with initial knowledge embeddings
    across 2 core domains (Maintenance + Safety).
  - RAG pipelines operational, delivering ≥ 90 % retrieval
    precision for selected test datasets.
  - Telemetry dashboards live, showing retrieval latency,
    accuracy, and data freshness.
  - Data-to-Agent API integrated into MCP and adopted by 2+ AI
    Agent families.
  - Knowledge Playbook published — reusable design patterns for
    data ingestion, embeddings, and retrieval governance.
  
  Why does this Role Matter?
  
  - The AI Data & Knowledge Engineer is the intelligence enabler
    behind every AI Agent.Without a robust, governed, and
    high-precision knowledge layer, AI features remain shallow
    and disconnected.
  - This role transforms Innovapptive’s platform into a
    contextually aware, continuously learning system — where
    every AI decision is grounded in trusted enterprise and
    field data.
  
  What We Offer
  
  - Competitive compensation and equity tied to measurable
    impact on AI accuracy and performance.
  - A platform to shape the semantic intelligence layer of a
    category-defining industrial SaaS company.
  - Hybrid work model — Hyderabad or remote with periodic travel
    to Houston HQ.
  - Access to cutting-edge AI, data, and observability
    toolchains for continuous learning and innovation.
