  Build a Safer World.
  
  TRM Labs provides blockchain analytics and AI solutions to
  help law enforcement and national security agencies,
  financial institutions, and cryptocurrency businesses
  detect, investigate, and disrupt crypto-related fraud and
  financial crime. TRM’s blockchain intelligence and AI
  platforms include solutions to trace the source and
  destination of funds, identify illicit activity, build
  cases, and construct an operating picture of threats. TRM is
  trusted by leading agencies and businesses worldwide who
  rely on TRM to enable a safer, more secure world for all.
  
  The AI & Automation team at TRM is responsible for designing
  and building AI-powered applications and agentic solutions
  that help our internal teams operate at scale. We partner
  directly with business leaders across the company to
  identify high-impact opportunities, then design, build, and
  own end-to-end solutions that meaningfully move key business
  metrics.
  
  We are looking for a Senior AI Engineer (AI Automation) who
  is excited to work hands-on with modern AI technologies,
  build custom internal tools, and operate with a high degree
  of ownership. This role is ideal for engineers who want to
  stay deeply technical while also shaping what gets built,
  not just how it’s built.
  
  As a member of the AI & Automation team, you will embed
  closely with business teams (e.g., Intelligence, R&D,
  Operations, Talent, Finance, Legal, R&D), identify their
  most critical challenges, and design AI-enabled solutions
  that drive measurable outcomes. You’ll own these systems
  end-to-end—from ideation and architecture through delivery,
  iteration, and long-term maintenance.
  
  The impact you’ll have here:
  
  - Design, build, and own full-stack, AI-powered internal
    applications, including backend services, APIs, data
    storage, and user-facing interfaces.
  - Develop custom agentic solutions that leverage state-of-the-
    art AI models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini) to
    automate workflows, augment decision-making, and scale
    business processes.
  - Embed within internal teams to deeply understand their
    goals, constraints, and key metrics, then translate those
    needs into technical solutions with clear success
    criteria.
  - Own projects end-to-end, including technical design,
    architecture decisions, scoping, delivery, iteration, and
    ongoing support.
  - Collaborate with non-technical stakeholders to expand their
    understanding of what’s possible with AI and help shape
    more ambitious solutions.
  - Build reliable, scalable systems that are used across the
    organization and touch critical parts of TRM’s operations.
  - Continuously evaluate impact, iterating on solutions
    quarter-over-quarter based on measurable business
    outcomes.
  - Contribute to a fast-moving, high-ownership engineering
    culture that values quality, velocity, and real-world
    impact.
  
  What we’re looking for:
  
  - 6+ years full-stack software engineering experience building
    scalable web applications, services, and APIs
  - Proficiency in JavaScript/TypeScript and/or Python, and
    comfort working across the stack including frontend
    development (React or similar frameworks)
  - Experience building backend systems, working with various
    datastores such as (Postgres/pgvector, Pinecone, Redis)
    and designing APIs.
  - Demonstrated curiosity and hands-on experience with AI tools
    and applications - using modern AI models, agentic IDEs,
    or building AI-enabled workflows or prototypes.
  - Experience building or experimenting with custom developed
    agentic systems, workflow orchestration tools (n8n), or
    Agentic browser automation
  - A high degree of ownership and initiative, with the ability
    to operate independently in ambiguous problem spaces
  - Excellent communication skills, with the ability to explain
    complex technical concepts to both technical and non-
    technical audiences
  - Experience collaborating cross-functionally and building
    trust with stakeholders at all levels of the organization
  
  Bonus:**
  
  - Direct experience integrating automated AI
    Evaluation/Testing/Observability suites to continuously
    test model effectiveness leveraging platforms such as
    DeepEval, Langfuse/LangSmith or similar
  
  About the Team:
  
  - The team operates on a weekly sprint schedule. Individuals
    on the team are tasked to lead projects as technical
    anchors, and given a chance to grow and take ownership
    according to their level and goals. We work closely with
    our internal stakeholders to deliver impactful features to
    our internal customers and the company.
  - The team’s culture is built on psychological safety wherein
    team members build rapport and trust-based relationships
    with teammates, hold each other accountable and to a high
    bar, collaborate extensively, and have lots of fun along
    the way.
  - The team’s timezone is a mix of EST and PST with at least 6
    hours of overlap with PST (8 am to 2 pm PST)
  - On-Call: We have an on-call rotation that is specific to
    internal tools. In this role, the internal tools engineer
    is responsible for triaging customer support requests from
    specific Slack channels pertaining to internal tools.
  
  Life at TRM
  
  We are building a safer world. That promise shows up in how
  we work every day.
  
  TRM runs fast. Really fast. We’re a high‑velocity,
  high‑ownership team that expects clarity, follow‑through,
  and impact. People who thrive here are energized by hard
  problems, experimentation, and direct feedback. If something
  takes months elsewhere, it often ships here in days.
  
  That pace isn’t for everyone. If you are optimizing
  primarily for consistent work-life balance, use the
  interview process to pressure-test fit. We want teammates
  who thrive here, not just survive here.
  
  AI Fluency at TRM
  
  AI fluency is a baseline expectation at TRM.
  
  We believe AI meaningfully changes how top performers
  operate. We expect every team member to use AI to accelerate
  and reimagine their craft, not just automate surface tasks.
  
  At TRM, AI fluency means you are among the top 10 percent of
  operators in your function in how you apply AI to:
  
  - Accelerate repeatable workflows
  - Structure and solve problems
  - Improve output quality
  - Increase speed and leverage
  
  You will be evaluated on applied AI fluency during the
  interview process.
  
  Leadership Principles
  
  We hire and grow against three leadership principles.
  They’re the standards for how we operate, treat each other,
  and make decisions.
  
  - Impact-Oriented Trailblazer: We put customers first and move
    with speed, focus, and adaptability. We treat every plan
    like an experiment – test, ship, measure, and iterate
    quickly.
  - Master Craftsperson: We care deeply about our craft. We
    balance speed with high standards, own outcomes
    end‑to‑end, and invest in getting better everyday.
  - Inspiring Colleague: We add clarity and energy, not noise.
    We bring humility, candor, and a one‑team mindset — giving
    and receiving feedback to make the team stronger.
