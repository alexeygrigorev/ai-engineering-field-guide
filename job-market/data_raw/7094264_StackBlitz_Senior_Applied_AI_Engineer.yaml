  🚀 About Us
  
  We’re Bolt.new by StackBlitz!
  
  We’re the team that brought you WebContainers, the first-of-
  its-kind technology that made it possible to run Node.js
  right inside your browser. That breakthrough kicked off our
  journey in 2019, and it’s what powers the blazing-fast
  online IDE used by over 1 million developers every month.
  
  But we didn’t stop there. We doubled down on everything we
  learned and built Bolt.new — the fastest way to go from idea
  to production without writing traditional code. It’s a next-
  gen, AI-powered app builder that helps you create, edit, and
  deploy full-stack web and mobile apps instantly, right in
  your browser. No installs. No setup. Just smart automation
  and instant dev environments that let you move at the speed
  of thought.
  
  We’re a fully remote team, globally distributed, deeply
  collaborative, and seriously passionate about building the
  future of software development.
  
  This is your chance to join a small team with a big vision.
  If you love shipping fast, solving real problems, and
  pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, we’d love to meet
  you.
  
  ✨ About This Opportunity
  
  Join us on the forefront of AI-powered development as we
  revolutionize how software gets built. As a Senior Applied
  Engineer, you will be the driving force behind our AI agents
  that transform natural language into production ready
  applications. You will work with state-of-the art LLMs,
  pioneering new ways to make AI understand, reason about, and
  generate complex full-stack applications. This isn’t just
  about integrating APIs, instead it’s about pushing the
  boundaries of what AI can do to empower our users to build
  stunning apps. As part of this role, you will work in an
  interesting problem space and tackle challenges like
  maintaining context across large codebases, orchestrating
  multi-step workflows that feel intuitive to users, and
  making sure our AI agents can handle everything from simple
  UI changes to complex architectural decisions. Your work
  will directly impact how millions of users bring their ideas
  to life.
  
  This is a unique opportunity to shape the future of AI-
  assisted development in a fully remote, globally distributed
  team that ships fast and thinks big. If you are passionate
  about making AI more capable, reliable, and accessible to
  builders everywhere, this role offers the perfect
  opportunity to innovate and see your work deployed at scale.
  
  🛠️ How You'll Contribute
  
  - Develop AI Agents: Design and implement AI agent features
    and extend existing agents with new capabilities. This
    includes managing the agent’s context (using techniques
    like sub-agents, retrieval based context management,
    sliding context windows, etc.) so it can handle long
    conversations or large knowledge and code bases
    efficiently.
  - Integrate Multiple LLM Providers: Leverage models from
    providers such as OpenAI (GPT series), Anthropic (Claude),
    and Google (Gemini). Quantitatively evaluate and choose
    the best model for a given task, and incorporate new model
    features or improvements (often by beta-testing new
    releases and assessing their strengths).
  - Tool Use and Workflow Orchestration: Enable the AI agent to
    call external tools and APIs safely and effectively.
    Implement structured approaches to allow the agent to
    perform actions like web searches, database queries, fetch
    additional information, or other domain-specific
    operations. Utilize frameworks such as Vercel’s AI SDK,
    LangGraph and others for building multi-step AI workflows.
  - Team Collaboration: Work closely with your immediate team
    and adjacent teams to deliver AI-powered features.
    Collaborate effectively with peer engineers and product
    managers to ensure AI-driven features are production-
    ready, efficient, maintainable, and well-monitored in
    deployment. Share knowledge and help lift up mid-level and
    junior engineers on the team.
  - Data Collection and Analysis: Collect and curate datasets
    from agent responses and multi-turn conversations to
    understand agent behavior. Analyze conversation patterns,
    failure modes, and success signals to derive actionable
    insights that drive improvements to agent performance and
    user experience.
  - Continuous Improvement and Evaluation: Stay up-to-date with
    the latest research in NLP and LLMs, and experiment with
    novel techniques (e.g. new prompting strategies, context
    handling methods, model fine-tuning opportunities).
    Continuously evaluate the AI system’s performance using
    systematic tests and user feedback, and iterate on
    prompts, agents and workflows to improve output quality
    and reliability (for example, by developing automated LLM
    evaluation benchmarks).
  
  💡 Qualifications
  
  - TypeScript: Familiarity with TypeScript is important. Our
    entire stack is built on it. Willingness to work in TS
    daily is key.
  - LLM Experience: Hands-on experience working with Large
    Language Models (LLMs) and understanding their
    capabilities and limitations. Proven experience building
    applications or systems powered by LLMs.
  - Prompt Engineering: Deep understanding of prompt engineering
    best practices to guide LLM behavior. Able to craft,
    refine, and optimize prompts for different tasks and
    models.
  - Software Engineering Skills: Solid software engineering
    fundamentals with experience in building production-ready
    systems.
  - Autonomous Execution: Ability to deliver high-quality work
    with minimal oversight. Comfortable owning tasks end-to-
    end, managing complexity, and driving projects to
    completion within your functional area.
  - Problem-Solving: Strong analytical and problem-solving
    skills with the ability to debug complex AI behaviors and
    bring clarity to ambiguous tasks.
  - Data-Driven Mindset: Comfortable collecting, curating, and
    analyzing data to inform decisions. Able to build
    datasets, identify patterns in agent behavior, and
    translate findings into actionable improvements.
  - Strong verbal and written English communication skills are
    required, as this role involves frequent collaboration
    with team members, stakeholders, and customers where
    English is the primary working language.
  
  🎯 Bonus Points
  
  - DSPy Framework: Familiarity with DSPy (Declarative Self-
    improving Python) for building modular AI systems and
    optimizing prompts programmatically.
  - Machine Learning Background: Understanding of ML
    fundamentals and experience with model evaluation metrics.
  - Open Source Contributions: Experience contributing to or
    maintaining open-source AI/ML projects.
  - Research Background: Experience reading and implementing
    techniques from AI/ML research papers.
