  Job Description
  
  We're building the AI Engineering team at AGS from the
  ground up—and we need a technical anchor in India to make it
  work. As Lead AI Solutions Engineer, you'll own day-to-day
  technical decisions, mentor engineers, and drive projects
  from concept to production. You're the Head of AI
  Engineering's counterpart for delivery execution. While
  leadership in North America sets architecture and strategy,
  you'll translate that into working software and guide the
  team through implementation. This is a hands-on technical
  leadership role. You'll write code, review code, architect
  solutions, and make other engineers better. You'll have real
  authority over technical decisions and full accountability
  for delivery outcomes.
  
  If you want to lead technically without becoming a full-time
  people manager, this is your role.
  
  
  
  Key Responsibilities:

  - Own day-to-day technical decisions for the India engineering
    team

    systems
  - Troubleshoot complex issues across the full stack
  
  Team Development

  - Conduct technical interviews and help grow the team
  - Set quality expectations and hold the team to them
  - Build a culture of ownership where every engineer can
    deliver end-to-end
  
  Stakeholder Collaboration
  
  - Translate business requirements into technical solutions
  - Provide estimates and communicate trade-offs clearly
  - Partner with QA and Analysts to ensure quality and
    completeness

  - 5-8 years of software engineering experience with
    demonstrated technical leadership
  - Strong programming fundamentals in Python and/or TypeScript
  - Experience building AI/ML applications, conversational
    interfaces, or intelligent automation
  - Solid understanding of API design, integration patterns, and
    cloud platforms
  - Track record of mentoring other engineers and raising team
    capability
  - Ability to operate independently with minimal direction
  
  Preferred
  
  - Experience with Microsoft Power Platform (Power Apps, Power
    Automate, Copilot Studio)
  - Background in Azure AI services, OpenAI APIs, or similar LLM
    platforms
  - Understanding of prompt engineering, RAG patterns, and LLM
    application design
  - Experience in staffing, HR tech, or workforce management
