  Who are we?
  
  Ema is building the next generation AI technology to empower
  every employee in the enterprise to be their most creative
  and productive. Our proprietary tech allows enterprises to
  delegate most repetitive tasks to Ema, the Universal AI
  employee. We are founded by ex-Google, Coinbase, Okta
  executives, and serial entrepreneurs. We’re well-funded by
  the top investors and angels in the world. Ema is based in
  Silicon Valley and Bangalore.
  
  Why does this role exist?
  
  At Ema, we are not just building an AI product; we are
  building an AI-native organization from
  
  the ground up. Our mission is to serve as a model for the
  future of work, leveraging artificial
  
  intelligence to its fullest. We believe that the most
  valuable work is creative, strategic, and
  
  uniquely human. Everything else must be done by AI.
  
  To achieve this vision, we are building an elite team of AI
  Application Engineers in the CTO’s
  
  Office to bring this vision to life. This team will
  envision, design & build Agentic AI tools to
  
  fundamentally reshape how Ema operates - setting the bar for
  the post-AI era.
  
  What is the role?
  
  We are looking for a foundational member for a
  transformative team aimed at revolutionizing Ema using
  Agentic AI. This role is about reimagining the future of
  work and then bringing it to life.
  
  You will be a hybrid of product manager, strategic thinker &
  engineer, with a mandate to
  
  identify and solve problem statements with Agentic AI to
  deliver impact.
  
  What you’ll do day to day?
  
  1. Agentic AI Tool Building:
  
  ● You will serve as the Product Manager, Designer &
  Developer in building AI-powered tools
  
  to streamline workflows for our teams and partners
  
  ● Develop Custom Software: Build AI-powered micro-SaaS tools
  and intelligent
  
  applications to solve specific challenges across Ema
  
  ● Leverage Modern AI Tooling: Utilize the latest generation
  of AI-native development
  
  tools (e.g., Cursor, Lovable etc.) and LLM frameworks to
  rapidly prototype, build, and
  
  deploy valuable solutions.
  
  2. Agentic Automation:
  
  ● Opportunity Discovery: Uncover problem statements for AI-
  driven automation across
  
  our processes and architect AI agents to automate the work
  
  ● Deliver Impact: Leverage cutting-edge agentic workflow
  platforms—including our own
  
  Ema platform in your journey to deliver value
  
  Who We Are Looking For:
  
  ● High Agency: You love to operate independently and
  autonomously to create outsized impact
  
  ● A Builder at Heart: You have a demonstrable passion for
  creating things, whether it's
  
  scripts, full-stack applications, or complex automated
  workflows. You likely have a
  
  portfolio of projects you're proud of.
  
  ● Product Thinker: You love talking to users and
  understanding their pain-points then
  
  designing solutions that suit them
  
  ● A First-Principles Thinker: You don't just solve the
  problem as it's presented. You dig
  
  deep to understand the root cause and envision a completely
  new, more efficient way of
  
  operating.
  
  ● AI-Curious & Rapid Learner: You are fascinated by the
  latest developments in AI, LLMs,
  
  and agentic systems. You are not afraid to pick up new tools
  and technologies on the fly
  
  to find the best solution for the problem at hand.
  
  ● Product-Minded: You have a keen sense for user experience
  and can build tools that are
  
  not just functional but also intuitive and delightful for
  your internal customers.
  
  Bonus Points
  
  ● Experience with no-code/low-code automation platforms
  (e.g., Zapier, Make, n8n).
  
  ● Familiarity with agentic AI frameworks like LangChain,
  AutoGen, or CrewAI.
  
  ● Familiarity with AI development tools (Lovable, Cursor,
  Copilot etc.)
