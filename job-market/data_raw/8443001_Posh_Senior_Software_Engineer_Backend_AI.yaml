  About Posh
  
  We are all social creatures, but the dominant “social”
  companies today have evolved into digital loneliness
  machines, driving isolation, anxiety, and mental health
  challenges around the world.
  
  Human connection is lost. Posh is a beacon guiding us back.
  
  Posh enables anyone to build an IRL community based on
  shared interests, while connecting consumers with the
  communities of people just like them. Founded by event
  organizers who were frustrated with the growing loneliness
  epidemic and the tools available to build their own event
  brand, we’ve built the ultimate platform for launching,
  monetizing, and finding IRL communities of people just like
  you. In just 5 years, Posh has grown to a team of 65,
  expanded to 7M+ users, secured $70m in venture funding, and
  facilitated over $300M in transactions.
  
  About the Role
  
  We’re looking for a Senior Backend Engineer to join our
  newly formed AI R&D pod—a small, fast-moving team dedicated
  to building the future of AI-native product experiences at
  Posh.
  
  This is a backend-focused role with a strong emphasis on
  systems architecture and AI implementation. You will be
  responsible for building the intelligent, scalable, and
  reliable systems that power our AI features. Your work will
  focus on designing and deploying sophisticated Multi-Agent
  Systems, moving beyond simple RAG to create truly autonomous
  and helpful user experiences.
  
  You’ll work closely with frontend engineers and product
  designers to bring cutting-edge AI tools to our platform.
  Expect to build robust APIs, architect data flows for
  evaluations and fine-tuning, and pioneer new ways to
  leverage AI within our existing infrastructure. This
  represents a unique opportunity to build the foundational
  backend of our AI products, with the chance to ship
  experimental features to a large, growing, and highly
  engaged user base.
  
  This is a 5 day a week commitment at our NYC office in SoHo.
  
  What You’ll Learn & Achieve
  
  - Build and Scale AI Services: Design, build, and maintain
    scalable backend services and APIs for AI-powered
    features, writing primary production code in Python.
  - Architect Multi-Agent Systems: Move beyond standard RAG to
    design and implement complex, hierarchical Multi-Agent
    Systems that can perform sophisticated, multi-step tasks.
  - Implement Evaluation and Fine-Tuning: Build robust
    frameworks to evaluate the quality of AI systems and
    manage fine-tuning pipelines to continuously improve model
    performance.
  - Own Cloud Infrastructure with IaC: Define, deploy, and
    manage our AI infrastructure using Terraform. You'll be
    responsible for scaling our container-based serverless
    solutions while ensuring reliability and performance.
  - Optimize for Efficiency: Deeply analyze the tradeoffs
    between model performance, latency, and cost to make
    pragmatic, business-aware technical decisions when using
    managed AI services.
  - Integrate Across the Stack: Collaborate with our core
    engineering teams by occasionally working in TypeScript
    (Node.js) to integrate AI features into our main
    application.
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - 3–6+ years of backend or full-stack engineering experience,
    with a proven track record of shipping high-quality,
    scalable systems in fast-paced environments.
  - Deep expertise in Python and its ecosystem for web services
    and data processing.
  - Strong experience with Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), a
    major cloud platform (e.g., GCP, AWS, Azure), and
    deploying containerized applications.
  - A passion for shaping 0→1 products in a lean, fast-paced R&D
    environment where you'll help define new playbooks for AI-
    native experiences.
  
  Bonus points for:
  
  - Pragmatic AI/ML Exposure: Familiarity with managed AI
    services (e.g., Vertex AI, AWS Bedrock), working with
    LLMs, or building advanced AI systems is a plus.
    Experience with model evaluation frameworks (e.g., RAGAs,
    LangSmith, DeepEval) or fine-tuning is helpful but not
    required. The ability to think about tradeoffs between
    cost, latency, and performance is valuable.
  - Experience with open-source agentic frameworks (e.g.,
    LangGraph, CrewAI, Strands, etc) is a plus.
  - Experience with MLOps, data engineering, or a background in
    consumer, marketplace, or event-driven platforms.
  
  Why This Role Matters
  
  We believe AI will reshape how people plan and participate
  in real-world experiences. The companies that integrate AI
  directly into their product to create visible, daily value
  will define the next generation of consumer software.
  
  At Posh, we’re not here to build infrastructure for others.
  We’re here to lead our category with a product that feels
  intelligent, personal, and effortlessly useful. And we’re
  just getting started.
