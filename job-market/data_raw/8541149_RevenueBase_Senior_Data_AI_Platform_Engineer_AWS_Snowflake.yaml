company: RevenueBase
location: USA
work_type: FULL_TIME
level: Expert/Leader
description: |
  RevenueBase:
  
  - We're building the data infrastructure that makes AI agents
    trustworthy instead of error-prone.
  - We provide continuously refreshed, verified B2B data for
    autonomous AI agents and GTM workflows.
  - We've tripled growth while maintaining 100% gross dollar
    retention and staying cashflow positive.
  - We power AI agents for Clay, Zoominfo, Dun & Bradstreet, and
    the next generation of AI GTM tools.
  
  About the Role
  
  We are looking for a Senior Data & AI Platform Engineer to
  build internal tools and services on top of our large-scale
  data infrastructure. Your primary focus will be developing
  systems that leverage vector embeddings, LLM APIs, and
  semantic search to unlock value from structured and
  unstructured data.
  
  This is a hands-on engineering role for someone who enjoys
  building practical AI-powered tools — not just experiments —
  and shipping them into production in a fast-moving startup
  environment.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Design and build data-driven tools that operate on large
    datasets stored in S3 and Snowflake
  - Implement pipelines that:
    - Extract specific columns or datasets from Snowflake
    - Generate vector embeddings via APIs such as OpenAI
    - Store and manage embeddings in vector databases like
      Pinecone
    - Enable semantic search and similarity-based retrieval
  - Develop enrichment workflows that:
    - Query structured data
    - Use LLM APIs to generate new derived columns
    - Write enriched results back into Snowflake
  - Build reusable internal services and SDKs around embedding
    generation, prompt orchestration, and data augmentation
  - Optimize performance and cost across AWS infrastructure
  - Work closely with product and data teams to turn use cases
    into scalable engineering solutions
  - Ensure reliability, observability, and maintainability of
    AI-powered pipelines
  
  Example Projects
  
  - Tool to extract a single Snowflake column, generate
    embeddings, push to Pinecone, and expose a semantic search
    API
  - Batch enrichment pipeline that queries records from
    Snowflake, calls OpenAI APIs for structured enrichment,
    and writes new columns back
  - Internal framework for LLM-based data transformation and
    validation
  - Query abstraction layer to make AI-enhanced analytics
    accessible to non-engineering teams
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  - 5+ years of software engineering experience
  - Strong backend engineering skills (Python preferred; other
    modern languages acceptable)
  - Solid experience with:
    - AWS (IAM, Lambda, ECS/EKS, S3, networking, security best
      practices)
    - Data warehousing (Snowflake preferred)
    - API design and distributed systems
  - Hands-on experience working with LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI) and
    embedding workflows
  - Experience with vector databases (Pinecone or similar)
  - Strong understanding of data modeling, ETL/ELT patterns, and
    performance optimization
  - Production experience in at least one startup environment
  - Ability to operate independently and ship high-impact
    systems end-to-end
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Experience building internal developer platforms or data
    tooling
  - Familiarity with prompt engineering and evaluation pipelines
  - Experience with orchestration frameworks (Airflow, Prefect,
    Dagster)
  - Exposure to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
  - Infrastructure-as-code experience (Terraform, CDK)
  - Experience managing large-scale embedding refresh and re-
    indexing workflows
  
  What Success Looks Like
  
  - Engineers and analysts can easily leverage AI-powered data
    enrichment
  - Embedding-based search works reliably at scale
  - New AI use cases can be implemented quickly using shared
    internal tooling
  - Systems are robust, observable, and cost-efficient
  
  Why Join Us?
  
  - Work on practical, production-grade AI systems
  - Direct impact on how data is leveraged across the company
  - Startup speed with real ownership and autonomy
  - Opportunity to define the internal AI platform from the
    ground up
industries:
  - Artificial Intelligence
  - Information Technology
  - Software
  - Database
