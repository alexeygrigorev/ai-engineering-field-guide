  About AssemblyAI
  
  AssemblyAI builds the best-in-class Speech AI models
  powering the next generation of voice applications. Our
  models serve 600M+ inference calls monthly, process 1M+
  hours of audio daily, and power 2 billion+ end-user
  experiences—from voice agents and meeting assistants to
  contact centers and medical scribes. Companies like Zoom,
  Granola, Fireflies, Cluely, and Calabrio rely on AssemblyAI
  to ship production-ready voice AI.
  
  We're at an inflection point in Speech AI. We released
  Universal-Streaming in mid-2025, and it has quickly earned
  its place as the model offering the best accuracy-latency-
  cost tradeoff on the market. Our research team drives these
  advances and ships with relentless velocity. Since releasing
  Universal-Streaming, we've already launched keyterms
  prompting feature and multilingual support—with more
  significant improvements on the roadmap.
  
  We've raised $115M+ from Accel, Insight Partners, Y
  Combinator's AI Fund, Patrick and John Collison, Nat
  Friedman, and Daniel Gross. We're a remote team building one
  of the next great AI companies—and we're looking for
  researchers who will shape its future.
  
  About the Role:
  
  We're looking for an Applied AI Engineer to join our team at
  the intersection of cutting-edge AI research and real-world
  customer applications. This is a highly dynamic, customer-
  facing technical role where you'll build demos, troubleshoot
  production issues, and help customers implement our Speech
  AI models in creative and impactful ways.
  
  You'll be working directly with developers and technical
  teams at companies ranging from early-stage startups to
  enterprise organizations. Your days will involve rapid
  context-switching between building prototypes for new use
  cases, debugging urgent customer issues, and collaborating
  with our Sales, Success, Engineering, Product, and Research
  teams to ensure customers succeed with our platform.
  
  This role requires strong technical skills, excellent
  communication abilities, and the creativity to solve novel
  problems under time pressure. You'll be empowered to use AI
  tools and modern development practices to deliver solutions
  quickly and effectively.
  
  What You’ll Do:Customer-Facing Technical Work (60%)
  
  - Guide customers through their entire product journey—from
    initial implementation and technical onboarding, through
    development and testing, all the way to production
    deployment. Continue to provide support post-launch to
    ensure their implementation is performing optimally and
    meeting their business objectives
  - Build custom demos and prototypes that showcase how
    AssemblyAI's models can solve specific customer use cases
  - Lead technical discovery sessions with prospects and
    customers to understand their requirements and design
    optimal implementations
  - Assist with competitive evaluations by providing benchmarks,
    designing fair comparison tests, and helping customers
    evaluate our models against alternatives. Work closely
    with customers to ensure they have the data and support
    needed to make informed decisions
  - Troubleshoot production issues for customers using our
    streaming and async APIs, sometimes requiring you to debug
    code in languages you may not use daily (Java, Go, Ruby,
    etc.)
  - Provide technical guidance on architecture, scaling, data
    privacy, and best practices for integrating our APIs
  - Create proofs-of-concept that demonstrate the "art of the
    possible" with Speech AI
  - Travel to customer sites for technical workshops,
    implementation support, and relationship building with key
    accounts
  
  Internal Collaboration & Product Influence (30%)
  
  - Serve as the voice of the customer to our Product and
    Research teams—test and dogfood new products and features
    before they reach customers, providing feedback from a
    practitioner's perspective. Advocate for improvements and
    new capabilities based on real-world use cases you
    encounter, ensuring our roadmap aligns with customer needs
  - Contribute to documentation, guides, and example code that
    help developers integrate our APIs more effectively
  - Identify patterns in customer issues and work with
    Engineering to address root causes (SDK improvements,
    better error messages, new features)
  - Collaborate with Sales and Success teams to ensure smooth
    handoffs and consistent customer experience
  - Participate in team off-sites to align on strategy, share
    learnings, and build team cohesion
  
  Innovation & Thought Leadership (10%)
  
  - Stay current on AI/ML developments, particularly in speech
    recognition, NLP, and audio processing
  - Experiment with new use cases and applications of our models
  - Build and maintain an open-source repository of demos,
    integrations, and reference implementations
  - Represent AssemblyAI at conferences and industry events,
    delivering talks or running workshops when appropriate
  
  What You’ll Need:Required
  
  - Located in or willing to relocate to New York City or San
    Francisco
  - 4+ years of customer-facing experience in highly technical
    environments, requiring strong software engineering
    skills, including roles such as Solutions Architect,
    Developer Advocate, Technical Solutions Engineer, or
    equivalent
  - Strong programming skills in Python and/or
    TypeScript/JavaScript, with the ability to read and debug
    code in other languages
  - Excellent written and verbal communication skills—you'll be
    writing customer emails, internal documentation, and
    technical guides regularly
  - Experience with web APIs, WebSockets, and real-time data
    streaming
  - Understanding of audio fundamentals (sample rates, encoding
    formats, codecs) or willingness to learn quickly
  - Ability to leverage AI tools creatively to move
    quickly—proficiency with tools like Claude, Cursor,
    Windsurf, or similar AI-assisted development tools to
    accelerate prototyping, debugging, and problem-solving
  - Problem-solving mindset—you can debug unfamiliar codebases,
    identify root causes, and propose creative solutions
  - Comfort with ambiguity and fast-paced work—you'll often be
    the first line of defense on novel problems
  - Ability and willingness to travel domestically and
    internationally as needed (approximately 10-25% of the
    time)
  
  Preferred
  
  - Experience in a startup or high-growth environment
  - Understanding of cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure) and
    deployment patterns
  - Experience building prototypes or MVPs quickly
  - Public speaking or conference presentation experience
  
  What Makes You Stand Out
  
  - You're independently driven and competitive—you take
    ownership of customer outcomes, push yourself to deliver
    exceptional results, and are motivated by the challenge of
    solving hard problems and winning customer trust
  - You can balance technical depth with customer empathy—you
    understand when to dive into the details and when to step
    back and explain concepts simply
  - You thrive under pressure and can context-switch between
    building a demo, debugging a production issue, and
    answering technical questions on a sales call
  - You're resourceful and self-directed—you know when to use AI
    tools, when to consult documentation, and when to ask for
    help
  - You have a "get it done" mentality and are comfortable
    wearing many hats
  - You're genuinely curious about AI and excited to see how
    customers apply our models in unexpected ways
  - You enjoy building relationships with customers and
    representing AssemblyAI in person
  - You're excited about being part of a tech hub (NYC or SF)
    and leveraging proximity to customers and the AI community
