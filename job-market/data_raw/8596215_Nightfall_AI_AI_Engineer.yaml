  About Nightfall:
  
  Nightfall is the AI-native, unified data loss prevention and
  insider risk management platform that protects sensitive
  data across SaaS apps, GenAI tools, email, endpoint devices,
  and more. Hundreds of customers, spanning AI innovators to
  top 10 banks, trust Nightfall to detect and stop data
  exfiltration at scale. Nightfall enables organizations to
  innovate freely without the risks of losing intellectual
  property or exposing customer data. Our agentic platform
  helps security teams regain their time by putting data loss
  prevention on autopilot. With automatic remediation,
  security violations can be resolved automatically before
  they become incidents, and end-users can be automatically
  trained and coached in the moment to self-heal violations
  that they introduce.
  
  Nightfall is backed by leading VC firms including Bain
  Capital Ventures (Enrique Salem - former CEO of Symantec),
  Venrock (early investors in Cloudflare), WestBridge Capital,
  Pear VC (early investors in Dropbox and Doordash), and a
  cadre of cybersecurity leaders including Frederic Kerrest
  (founder of Okta), Maynard Webb (former COO of eBay), Ryan
  Carlson (President of Chainguard), Kevin Mandia (founder of
  Mandiant), and many others.
  
  About the role:
  
  At Nightfall AI, we’re building the future of data security
  with machine learning at its core. Our AI systems detect and
  prevent data leaks in real time for leading organizations.

  engineers to design and enhance the AI models that power our
  security products. Learn how to build and scale the
  underlying system that hosts these models.
  
  If you love solving hard problems, experimenting with the
  NLP model architectures, latest LLMs, eager to dive deep
  into the internals of the underlying systems, and ultimately
  make a real impact — this is your chance to jump in early
  and grow fast.
  
  💡 What You’ll Do
  
  - Build and ship the AI systems that power Nightfall’s

    benchmark and monitor model accuracy, build automation for
    automated training and deployment, and real-time
    inferencing.
  - Work hands-on with Go to build the microservices that ingest
    and process data at scale through the use of streaming
    infrastructure, distributed caching, and highly concurrent
    execution.
  - Collaborate across engineering and product to turn ideas
    into live AI features
  - Participate in the team's oncall rotation to help drive
    operational excellence
  
  🎯 You’re a Great Fit If You:
  
  - 3+ years of industry experience with a graduate degree in
    Computer Science or Engineering with rigorous coursework
    in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning or related
    field.
  - Code fluently in Python, and Go (or C++ or Java) with a
    solid understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms.
  - Hands-on experience with building deep learn
  - Thrive in fast-moving, high-ownership environments.
  - Are excited to learn from experienced mentors and level up
    quickly.
  
  ⚡ Bonus Points For:
  
  - Hands-on experience with using Pytorch, Spacy, Transformer,
    CNN, LSTM, or other deep learning architectures to solve
    complex problems in NLP or other domains.
  - Familiarity with AWS, GCP and experience with systems such
    as Kafka, Redis, Postgres, etc.
  - Hands-on experience with MLOps tools for training,
    inferencing, evaluation, monitoring and deployment
  - Hackathon wins, research papers, or open-source
    contributions.
