  Senior Software Engineer – AI Infrastructure
  
  
  
  About Arango
  
  At Arango, we believe the first generation of enterprise AI
  missed something essential: context. LLM models are
  powerful, but they didn’t understand the context needed to
  deliver accurate answers.
  
  Arango provides a trusted data foundation for the next wave
  of Enterprise AI with graph-based Contextual AI -
  transforming enterprise data into a System of Context that
  truly represents the business, so LLMs can deliver better
  outcomes with unlimited scale and cost efficiency.
  
  The Arango AI Data Platform gives developers a single,
  integrated environment to build and scale AI-powered
  applications without the complexity of stitching together
  multiple databases and tools. At its core is a massively
  scalable multi-model database that unifies graph, vector,
  document, and key-value data with full-text, geospatial, and
  vector search — creating the System of Context, the bridge
  between enterprise data and LLMs.
  
  We’re a global team based in California and Cologne, united
  by curiosity, collaboration, and a passion for helping
  developers, data engineers, and technology leaders innovate
  faster and smarter with AI. Trusted by NVIDIA, HPE, the
  London Stock Exchange, the U.S. Air Force, NIH, and
  Articul8, Arango powers enterprise AI with context,
  confidence, and scale. We are a proud member of the NVIDIA
  Inception Program and the AWS ISV Accelerate Program.
  
  If you’re excited about shaping the future of Contextual AI,
  come build with us.

  About the Role
  
  We are looking for a senior, hands-on software engineer to
  help maintain, stabilize, and debug our AI infrastructure.
  This role has high ownership and requires deep technical
  problem-solving skills in production environments. The most
  important qualification is not a specific language, but a
  strong understanding of how complex software systems
  actually behave in production.
  
  
  
  Key Responsibilities:
  
  - Maintain, develop and stabilize AI infrastructure services
  - Architect and implement foundational services and shared
    libraries that scale our entire AI infrastructure
    ecosystem.
  - Debug complex, non-obvious production issues across
    application, process, network, and memory layers
  - Systematically analyze, isolate, and resolve failures in
    unclear scenarios
  - Improve observability, profiling, and tracing across
    services
  - Work with distributed microservices and internal platforms
  - Operate and improve systems running on Docker, Kubernetes,
    and Helm
  - Support CI/CD pipelines (CircleCI), testing, and security-
    relevant components
  - Work with MLflow, Triton, and distributed Python modules
  
  
  
  Core Requirements:
  
  - Senior-level experience (minimum 5+ years)
  - Passion for working with cutting-edge technologies in a
    fast-moving AI environment, including LLM-based workflows
    and pipelines
  - Comfortable working independently in a fast-paced, evolving
    environment
  - Strong debugging skills in complex, distributed systems with
    the ability to identify root causes when failures are
    ambiguous
  - Solid understanding of how software behaves in production
    environments
  - Experience designing and operating microservices,
    distributed systems, and databases
  - Proven experience building and scaling high-availability
    services
  
  Core Technology Stack
  
  - Python (primary language) - 5+ years
  - Docker, Kubernetes, Helm - 5+ years
  - CI/CD pipelines and testing frameworks (e.g., CircleCI)
  - Observability tools: metrics, logs, tracing, and profiling
  - Exposure to AI/ML infrastructure, including tools such as
    MLflow and Triton
  
  Nice to Have:
  
  - Customer-facing experience, including proofs of concept
    (PoCs) or technical demos
  - Experience with AI/ML infrastructure and orchestration,
    i.e., MLflow and Triton
  - Cross-language debugging experience
  - Familiarity with Rust
  - Experience working with databases, NoSQL, multi-model, or
    graph databases
  - Knowledge of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
    GraphRAG concepts
  - Understanding of graph algorithms and graph-based data
    modeling
