  At Libra, we're transforming how legal professionals work.
  Our AI platform combines deep legal reasoning with cutting-
  edge generative technology to help lawyers research, draft,
  and deliver legal work faster and smarter.
  
  In just over a year, we became one of Europe's fastest-
  growing legal AI companies—and in late 2025, we joined
  Wolters Kluwer, the global leader in legal information
  services. Together, we're combining Libra's AI capabilities
  with Wolters Kluwer's authoritative legal content to build
  the most powerful AI workspace for lawyers in Europe. We've
  already launched in the Netherlands and are expanding across
  new markets with full localization and deep local content
  integrations.
  
  This is a unique opportunity to shape the next generation of
  legal AI products—now at true European scale.
  
  Role Overview
  
  As a SecOps Engineer (m/f/d) at Libra, you’ll lead the
  design, automation, and operation of security controls
  across our products and infrastructure trusted by top law
  firms and legal teams across Europe. You’ll secure internal
  and external traffic, identities, and data end‑to‑end
  building robust, observable, and compliant systems that
  enable fast, safe delivery through least‑privilege access,
  strong encryption, and continuous monitoring.
  
  This is a high‑impact role for engineers who thrive at the
  intersection of detection, response, and platform
  engineering. You’ll work at the Merantix AI Campus in
  Berlin, partnering closely with our AI, Product and DevOps
  teams to own network and perimeter security, security
  reviews for changes and third‑party integrations, ensuring
  Libra’s security posture scales with our customer base
  
  What You Will Do:
  
  - Own end-to-end security for internal and external traffic
    across Open Telekom Cloud (OTC) and Microsoft Azure,
    including network segmentation, mTLS, WAF, and IDS/IPS.
  - Define and operate IAM and RBAC: role design, SSO/SCIM
    provisioning, least-privilege policies, and periodic
    access reviews across cloud, SaaS, and internal systems.
  - Govern access to sensitive data and operational databases
    with policy-based controls, approval workflows, data
    masking, and query auditing.
  - Implement and manage secrets and key management (e.g.,
    vaulting, KMS/HSM), including rotation, revocation, and
    encryption standards.
  - Build and operate audit logging and SIEM pipelines: log
    collection, correlation rules, alert tuning, dashboards,
    and on-call runbooks.
  - Lead incident response readiness and execution: playbooks,
    tabletop exercises, forensics coordination, post-incident
    reviews, and continuous improvement.
  - Drive vulnerability and patch management: integrate
    SCA/SAST/DAST into CI/CD, container/OS hardening, and
    remediation tracking.
  - Secure endpoints, containers, and runtime systems using EDR,
    admission policies, baseline configurations, and
    sandboxing.
  - Conduct security reviews and threat modeling for
    architecture changes, releases, and third-party
    integrations; ensure secure-by-default guardrails.
  - Partner with DevOps and engineering to embed security
    controls into Terraform/Ansible, CI/CD pipelines, and the
    SDLC.
  - Champion a security-first culture through clear standards,
    training, and pragmatic guidance.
  
  What You Bring:
  
  - Strong experience operating security controls in cloud
    environments, ideally Open Telekom Cloud (OTC) or
    OpenStack.
  - Deep knowledge of IAM/RBAC, SSO/SCIM, and least-privilege
    access design.
  - Proficiency in network and perimeter security (TLS/mTLS,
    WAF, IDS/IPS, VPN/Zero Trust).
  - Hands-on experience with secrets and key management (Vault,
    KMS/HSM) and encryption best practices.
  - Experience building and tuning SIEM, EDR, and log pipelines;
    strong detection engineering and incident response skills.
  - Familiarity with vulnerability management and CI/CD security
    (SCA/SAST/DAST, container scanning) and system hardening
    (e.g., CIS benchmarks).
  - Solid understanding of European data protection and security
    compliance (e.g., GDPR, ISO 27001/SOC 2) and how to
    operationalize controls.
  - Excellent communication skills in English; German is a plus.
  - Entrepreneurial mindset with a strong sense of urgency;
    self-starter who works independently while aligning to
    team goals.
  
  What we offer:
  
  - Permanent employment from day one.
  - Remote work & flexibility: Work remotely up to 3 days per
    week (home office) (= 8 days a month in the office) with
    flexible working hours.
  - Work abroad flexibly: Work from anywhere within the EU for
    up to 20 days within a twelve-month period.
  - Rest & time off: 26 vacation days.
  - Show your commitment: 1 additional day off per year for your
    volunteer work (Volunteer Day).
  - Support for development: E-learning via LinkedIn, online
    language training with goFluent, and other training and
    development opportunities.
  
  Join us, at Wolters Kluwer, and be part of a global
  technology company that makes a difference every day. Be the
  difference. If making a difference matters to you, then you
  matter to us.

  Our Interview Practices
  
  To maintain a fair and genuine hiring process, we kindly ask
  that all candidates participate in interviews without the
  assistance of AI tools or external prompts. Our interview
  process is designed to assess your individual skills,
  experiences, and communication style. We value authenticity
  and want to ensure we’re getting to know you—not a digital
  assistant. To help maintain this integrity, we ask to remove
  virtual backgrounds and include in-person interviews in our
  hiring process. Please note that use of AI-generated
  responses or third-party support during interviews will be
  grounds for disqualification from the recruitment process.
  
  Applicants may be required to appear onsite at a Wolters
  Kluwer office as part of the recruitment process.
