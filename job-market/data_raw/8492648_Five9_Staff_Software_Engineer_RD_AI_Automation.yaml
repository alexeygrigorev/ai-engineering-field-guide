  Join us in bringing joy to customer experience.  Five9 is a
  leading provider of cloud contact center software, bringing
  the power of cloud innovation to customers worldwide.
  
  Living our values everyday results in our team-first culture
  and enables us to innovate, grow, and thrive while enjoying
  the journey together. We celebrate diversity and foster an
  inclusive environment, empowering our employees to be their
  authentic selves.
  
  The Team
  
  The Product Engineering team drives the development and
  realization of practical AI solutions for the contact‑centre
  environment. Our existing Studio product stack is built on
  PHP/Laravel, Python, and Vue.js, deployed across both
  private and public clouds. We leverage leading cloud AI
  services, including Azure OpenAI, Google AI APIs, IBM
  Watson, and Amazon Lex.
  
  Our vision is to reimagine the connection experience between
  end users and the brands that serve them. Our AI agents will
  deliver delightful, efficient self‑service at super‑human
  speeds, while seamlessly integrating live human agents
  whenever a human touch is required. These AI agents will
  also assist live agents and help supervisors and managers
  optimize the blend of human and AI workforce.
  
  The Staff Software Engineer role is part of the Studio
  Innovations team, which focuses on modernizing the existing
  Studio product. This team ensures our production systems
  remain stable, secure, and high‑performing, and is
  responsible for enhancements that transition the Studio
  platform into Java microservices on GCP.
  
  This position is based out of an affiliate office of Acqueon
  Technologies in India, following the hybrid work model of
  that location.
  
  Role Purpose
  
  The Staff Software Engineer in the R&D AI Automation Team is
  responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining the
  Studio product — a drag‑and‑drop flow builder and execution
  engine that integrates multiple channels such as voice, SMS,
  and chatbots with the Five9 contact‑centre voice platform.
  
  This role plays a key part in modernizing and
  re‑architecting the Studio product into Java-based
  microservices on GCP. Responsibilities include:
  
  - Software design, development, testing, and documentation
    across backend, frontend, and interaction management
    platforms.
  - Collaborating with product owners and designers to expand
    the feature set and deliver high‑quality user experiences.
  - Taking operational ownership of service performance and
    quality, including possible participation in an on‑call
    rotation.
  - Exploring cutting-edge technologies and partnering with
    product teams to convert ideas into production‑ready
    solutions.
  
  How You Contribute
  
  - Lead the design, development, and implementation of new
    features and change requests.
  - Write high-quality, efficient, and maintainable code with a
    focus on scalability and multi‑tenancy, while adhering to
    coding best practices.
  - Serve as the go‑to expert for ambiguous or time‑sensitive
    challenges.
  - Contribute to production incident management and debugging
    of complex issues using monitoring, logging, and APM tools
    such as New Relic, Grafana, and Prometheus.
  - Conduct thorough code reviews and maintain high coding
    standards.
  - Identify technical debt and propose actionable improvements.
  - Apply strong understanding of multiple programming
    languages, frameworks, and development methodologies to
    solve complex technical problems.
  - Act as a natural coach and mentor, providing technical
    guidance and support to peers.
  - Fill functional gaps across engineering and cross‑functional
    teams to maintain continuity and efficiency.
  - Ensure project milestones are met and development aligns
    with business objectives.
  - Contribute to documentation, specifications, processes, and
    APIs.
  
  Skills, Competencies, and QualificationsRequired
  
  - 8+ years of experience designing and developing
    high‑traffic, distributed, and scalable systems on cloud
    platforms such as GCP, AWS, or Azure within a SaaS
    environment.
  - Hands-on expertise in cloud‑native backend microservices
    development using Java and frameworks like Spring Boot.
  - High proficiency in multiple programming languages,
    including but not limited to Java, PHP, JavaScript, and
    Python.

  - Expertise in SQL and NoSQL databases, along with
    optimization techniques.
  - Expertise in CI/CD, containerization, and Kubernetes.
  - Solid understanding of web security best practices and the
    ability to implement application and data protection

  - A portfolio demonstrating experience in architecture,
    design, and full-stack development.
  - Ability to work both independently and collaboratively.
