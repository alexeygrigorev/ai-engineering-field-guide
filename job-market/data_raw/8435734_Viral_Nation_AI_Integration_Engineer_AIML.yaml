  Our ability to stay at the forefront of the industry has
  fuelled our success and will guide us in paving the path
  forward. We’re driven to push boundaries and think beyond
  today to deliver strategies, and we’re just getting started.
  
  While we continuously exceed our goals, we need your help –
  our success is only as great as our people. Strong
  performance leads to high expectations, and we must keep
  raising the bar!
  
  Viral Nation is seeking an AI Integration Engineer, AI/ML to
  serve as the primary technical engine translating high-level
  architectural visions into production-ready reality.
  Reporting directly to the Principal Architect, AI/ML and VP
  of Engineering, you will be responsible for the hands-on
  development, integration, and deployment of AI/ML models and
  agentic workflows within our GCP ecosystem.
  
  What You'll Do Here:
  
  - You will transform the Principal Architect’s reference
    architectures into scalable, deployable code using Python,
    GKE, and Cloud Run.
  - Your primary focus involves building out agentic ecosystems
    using Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) and Model Context
    Protocol (MCP), specifically focusing on the Agent-to-
    Agent (A2A) orchestration patterns defined by the
    Architect.
  - You will apply advanced prompt engineering and context
    engineering techniques to optimize LLM performance,
    ensuring agents maintain state and accuracy over long
    interactions.
  - You will develop and tune high-fidelity RAG pipelines using
    the Google RAG Engine and Agent Engine to ensure agents
    have the precise context required for influencer marketing
    workflows.
  - The role requires applying machine learning techniques to
    our massive datasets to implement automated anomaly
    detection, forecasting, and trend analysis.
  - You will perform advanced data science and analysis by
    generating and querying high-dimensional video and text
    embeddings to extract insights from social media content.
  - You will integrate Gemini and Model Garden LLMs into
    production applications while managing the technical
    nuances of token limits and context window optimization.
  - Partnering with the Architect, you will implement MLOps
    practices that track agent performance, cost-efficiency,
    and ethical AI safeguards within the GCP IAM framework.
  
  What You'll Need To Have:
  
  - Advanced proficiency in Python is required for AI/ML backend
    development, data analysis, and API construction.
  - You must possess a deep understanding of prompt engineering
    strategies (Chain-of-Thought, ReAct) and context
    engineering to maximize model reasoning capabilities.
  - The position demands deep hands-on experience with Google
    ADK, MCP, Vertex AI Pipelines, and the Google RAG Engine.
  - You should have practical experience applying classical ML
    algorithms for regression, forecasting, and anomaly
    detection on large-scale datasets.
  - The role requires a strong understanding of vector databases
    and the manipulation of video/text embeddings for semantic
    search and classification.
  - Deep experience with utilizing GitHub Actions to support the
    SDLC workflows and CI/CD standards established by the
    Principal Architect.
  
  Nice To Haves
  
  - Experience utilizing Snowflake Cortex Analyst, Cortex
    Search, and Snowflake Intelligence ecosystem.
  - Proficiency in Node.js for full-stack integration layer and
    tool development is highly regarded.
  - Prior experience in the digital marketing or influencer
    marketing space is a significant advantage.
  - Experience with containerization and orchestration using
    Docker and GKE will help scale our autonomous systems.
