  Rapid7 is seeking a Principal AI Engineer to lead the
  architectural evolution of our AI Center of Excellence. In
  this role, you will design and own the end-to-end
  distributed systems that make advanced ML, LLMs, and agentic
  AI reliable, scalable, and secure at an enterprise level.
  About the Team The AI Center of Excellence leverages
  advanced ML and agentic AI systems to protect our customers'
  attack surfaces by embedding intelligence into real-world
  security workflows. We operate in ambiguous problem spaces,
  valuing technical rigor and principled decision-making to
  deliver production-grade AI at scale. About the Role As a
  Principal AI Engineer - Data Science, your primary
  responsibility will be to define and own the system
  architecture for AI platforms and services across the
  organisation. Specifically, your focus will be to:
  
  - Own the end-to-end system architecture for AI, ML, and
    Agentic platforms, ensuring they are reliable, scalable,
    and secure.
  - Design complex data ingestion pipelines, feature stores, and
    inference microservices that bridge the gap between
    research and production.
  - Establish architectural standards and reference patterns for
    LLM orchestration, RAG systems, and multi-agent workflows.
  - Lead architectural reviews as the final technical authority,
    making critical trade-offs across accuracy, latency, cost,
    and reliability.
  
  The skills and qualities you'll bring include:
  
  - Exceptional ability to reason at the system and architecture
    level to make long-term technical decisions.
  - Courageous and principled decision-making when navigating
    high-stakes, ambiguous problem spaces.
  - Proven mentorship of Staff and Senior engineers, fostering
    growth in architectural thinking and technical rigor.
  - Accountability for the long-term technical health and
    security of AI systems across multiple teams.
  - 13+ years of experience in Data Science, ML Engineering, or
    Applied AI with a focus on large-scale systems.
  - Hands-on mastery of LLM orchestration frameworks such as
    LangChain and LangGraph for agentic workflows.
  - Deep expertise in designing RAG pipelines and managing
    vector database retrieval at scale.
  - Advanced proficiency in AWS ecosystems, specifically
    Bedrock, SageMaker, EKS, and Lambda.
  - Expertise in MLOps standards, including model registries,
    drift detection, and automated retraining frameworks.
  - Strong background in deep learning for NLP and sequence-
    based problems like malware behaviour modelling.
  - Proficiency in Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and CI/CD
    for ML workloads.
  - Experience implementing robust guardrails and evaluation
    frameworks (e.g., Promptfoo, HELM) for autonomous systems.
  
  Important: This is an Architecture-First role. If you
  haven't defended production AI system designs at scale, you
  aren't a fit-regardless of modelling strength. We know that
  the best ideas and solutions come from multi-dimensional
  teams. That's because these teams reflect a variety of
  backgrounds and professional experiences. If you are excited
  about this role and feel your experience can make an impact,
  please don't be shy - apply today. #LI-AK1 About Rapid7 At
  Rapid7, our vision is to create a secure digital world for
  our customers, our industry, and our communities. We do this
  by harnessing our collective expertise and passion to
  challenge what's possible and drive extraordinary impact.
