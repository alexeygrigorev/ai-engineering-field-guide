  TransUnion's Job Applicant Privacy Notice
  
  What We'll Bring:
  
  Lead the design and delivery of enterprise-scale AI/GenAI
  solutions (LLM apps, RAG pipelines, real-time processing,
  cloud-native services) across a polyglot stack (Python +
  Java). Own the technical roadmap from concept to deployment,
  ensuring scalability, performance, security, and responsible
  AI (fairness, transparency, compliance). Serve as a trusted
  technical leader, mentoring engineers, data scientists, and
  architects; define architecture standards, patterns, and
  best practices across teams. Drive PoCs and technical
  evaluations of emerging AI/GenAI technologies (including
  LangChain/LangGraph & LangChain4j, DJL, ONNX Runtime Java),
  aligning innovations with business outcomes. Bridge business
  stakeholders and engineering, translating complex
  requirements into robust designs and measurable impact.
  
  What You'll Bring:
  
  Architecture & Delivery
  
  - Architect end-to-end AI platforms integrating LLMs, RAG,
    streaming, vector search, and CI/CD—implemented via Python
    services and Java microservices (Spring
    Boot/Quarkus/Micronaut).
  - Define standards for REST/gRPC APIs, OAuth2/OIDC security,
    observability (Micrometer, OpenTelemetry), and SLIs/SLOs.
  - Establish coding, versioning, monitoring, governance for ML
    systems; champion reproducibility (MLflow/DVC) and model
    registries.
  
   LLM & RAG Engineering
  
  - Lead LLM fine‑tuning/evaluation/deployment; design retrieval
    pipelines using Elasticsearch/OpenSearch/Vespa and vector
    stores (pgvector, Pinecone, Weaviate) with Java and Python
    clients.
  - Build LangChain4j pipelines (prompts, tools, agents) and
    interoperable services that consume Python-hosted model
    endpoints via REST/gRPC.
  - Optimize embeddings, chunking, retrieval/ranking for
    latency, precision, and cost; implement caching, batching,
    and circuit breakers.
  
  Platforms & Cloud
  
  - GCP must have skill with Familiarity in AWS/Azure; 2+ years
    with CI/CD pipelines and 3+ years with Docker/Kubernetes.
  - Guide deployments on AWS/GCP/Azure using Docker/Kubernetes,
    Helm, service mesh (Istio/Linkerd), and managed ML
    services (SageMaker, Vertex AI, Azure ML).
  - Use DJL (Deep Java Library) and ONNX Runtime Java for on‑JVM
    inference where appropriate; integrate Spark/Databricks
    MLlib for large‑scale pipelines.
  
  Leadership & Collaboration
  
  - Mentor engineers and architects; contribute reusable assets,
    reference implementations, and accelerators.
  - Engage vendors/partners; participate in industry forums;
    advocate responsible AI and internal knowledge-sharing.
  
  Impact You'll Make:
  
  Technical Expertise (Python + Java)
  
  - Expert Python with PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn,
    Hugging Face Transformers.
  - Advanced Java (Java 8+), Spring Boot/Quarkus/Micronaut,
    Vert.x/Netty for high‑throughput services; concurrency, GC
    tuning, and performance engineering.
  - GenAI frameworks: LangChain/LangGraph (Python) and
    LangChain4j (Java) for agents, tools, and RAG workflows.
  - JVM ML/Inference: DJL, ONNX Runtime Java, TensorFlow Java;
    integration with Spark/Databricks MLlib.
  - APIs & Data: FastAPI/Flask (Python) and Spring Boot (Java);
    SQL/NoSQL (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra), JPA/Hibernate,
    Redis.
  - Search & Vector: Elasticsearch/OpenSearch/Lucene,
    pgvector/Pinecone/Weaviate with Java/Python SDKs.
  - Streaming & Messaging: Kafka, gRPC, event‑driven patterns.
  - Agentic AI Dev skills: LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI,
    AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, Spring AI (Java), MCP
    (Python/Java), LlamaIndex, RAG with
    Pinecone/Milvus/Weaviate/Qdrant/Chroma, vLLM, Ollama, Ray
    Serve, Langfuse, TruLens, MLflow, Python, Java, SQL +
    Vector DBs.
  
  - GCP Vertex AI, Google ADK and GCP AI skills
  
  MLOps & Cloud
  
  - MLflow/DVC, model versioning/monitoring, CI/CD
    (Jenkins/GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps), Maven/Gradle,
    Terraform.
  - Containers & Orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes,
    KServe/Seldon Core, Helm; cloud services (AWS/GCP/Azure).
  
  Analytical & Leadership
  
  - Strong statistics, hypothesis testing, experimental design;
    A/B testing frameworks.
  - Proven track record leading AI/ML teams/projects end‑to‑end;
    excellent stakeholder communication.
  
  Preferred/Nice-to-have
  
  - Reinforcement learning, meta‑learning, unsupervised
    learning.
  - Contributions to the AI/ML community (OSS, publications,
    talks).
  - Experience with Databricks, OpenTelemetry, service mesh,
    Vault/Secrets.
  
  This is a hybrid position and involves regular performance
  of job responsibilities virtually as well as in-person at an
  assigned TU office location for a minimum of two days a
  week.
