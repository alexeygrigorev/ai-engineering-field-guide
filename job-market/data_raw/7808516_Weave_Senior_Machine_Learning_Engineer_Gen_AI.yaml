description: |
  Weave is looking for engineers hungry for fun challenges who
  can join our self-empowered teams and contribute in both
  technical and non-technical ways.
  
  You will be joining a team of talented developers that share
  a common interest in distributed backend systems, data,
  scalability, and continued development. You will get a
  chance to apply these, and other skills, to new and ongoing
  projects to make machine learning more approachable, data
  more available, and easier to discover and use by helping
  design how teams build out AI powered features at Weave.
  
  Our teams are cross-functional agile teams composed of a
  product owner, backend and frontend devs and devops. Teams
  are highly autonomous with the ownership and ability to act
  in Weave’s best interest.
  
  Above all, your work will impact the way our customers
  experience Weave while working closely with a highly skilled
  team to accomplish varying goals and cultivate our
  phenomenal culture.
  
  PURPOSE
  
  The Machine Learning Team's mission is to enable product
  innovation by making it painless for developers to build ai
  powered applications that require access to large sets of
  data. Machine learning is challenging but we are striving to
  democratize access to the tools and technology that powers
  it so teams can build cutting edge features safely and
  responsibly without a PhD in Data Science. As a Machine
  Learning Engineer on the team you’ll be building models for
  new products with emerging technologies, at scale. We handle
  data for hundreds of millions of people daily.
  
  - This position will be available for fully remote in the US
    with an opportunity to work in an office, if located near
    the Lehi, UT Headquarters.
  - Reports to: Engineering Director
  
  What You Will Own
  
  - Design and Develop machine learning infrastructure, tooling,
    and models to help teams deliver world class experiences.
  - Help product and development teams understand the data
    lifecycle and the inherent experimental nature of machine
    learning.
  - Build internal products and platforms to enable teams to
    incorporate AI into their features and customer facing
