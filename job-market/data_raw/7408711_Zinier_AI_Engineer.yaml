  Who we are:
  
  Zinier’s No-Code Customization field service automation
  platform empowers field service organizations with the
  combined power of humans and technology to keep our world up
  and running.
  
  No two field service organizations are alike…
  
  From the IT ecosystem you connect with, to the workflows
  executed in the field, your business requirements are
  unique. And in the fast-paced world of field service, those
  requirements can change rapidly. And that’s exactly why you
  need Zinier.
  
  ZiniApps solve challenges across the entire lifecycle of
  field work. Off-the-shelf functional, but also customizable
  to meet specific use cases, ZiniApps cover the most
  meaningful jobs to be done in field service installation and
  maintenance.
  
  We are a global team headquartered in Silicon Valley with
  leading investors including Wipro, Telmex, Black & Veatch,
  NCR, Toshiba and Qualcomm Ventures LLC.

  Why we exist:
  
  Services shape how we live. Electricity lights up our homes.
  The Internet opens up our worlds. Cellular phones keep us
  connected no matter where we are. We take for granted the
  things we can turn on with the flip of a switch. But when
  even one of the services we depend on isn’t available, the
  day can quickly start to go sideways.
  
  For organizations that provide these services, some of the
  most important work happens in the field — in neighborhoods,
  across open spaces, and along millions of last miles that
  criss-cross the country. Every moment of downtime matters,
  which is why Zinier exists. Zinier empowers organizations to
  work smarter — from the main office to the field — to solve
  problems quickly, fix things before they break, and keep
  people in the rhythm of their days.
  
  To do this, Zinier has created a scalable platform powered
  by AI-driven insights and intelligent automation that helps
  field service teams work smarter, better, faster, and more
  efficiently. We help organizations automate routine tasks so
  the people in the field can focus on putting their expertise
  to work. We work with customers in telecom and energy.
  
  Role Overview
  
  We are seeking a highly motivated AI Engineer with strong
  fundamentals in machine learning and system design. This
  role is ideal for someone who enjoys building end-to-end AI
  services, understands the mathematics behind models, and
  thinks deeply about performance, scalability, and
  efficiency—beyond just applying pre-built tools. You will be
  part of the initial AI core team of engineers driving the AI
  initiatives at Zinier.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Design, build, and maintain end-to-end AI/ML services and
    components.
  - Develop, train, fine-tune, and evaluate AI/ML models for
    real-world use cases.
  - Contribute to the development of production-grade AI
    systems, including data pipelines, APIs, and deployment
    workflows.
  - Work closely with senior engineers and AI leaders to
    implement robust and scalable solutions.
  - Analyze model behavior and performance from a low-level,
    fundamentals-driven perspective.
  - Participate in architecture discussions, code reviews, and
    continuous improvement initiatives.
  - Debug, optimize, and enhance AI models and systems for
    accuracy, efficiency, and reliability.
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  - 3–5 years of experience in software engineering with at
    least 2 years working on AI/ML-based systems.
  - Hands-on experience building or contributing to end-to-end
    services or AI-driven products.
  - Strong understanding of machine learning fundamentals,
    including mathematical and statistical concepts.
  - Ability to reason about systems from first principles (data,
    algorithms, compute, memory) rather than only application-
    level abstractions.
  - Proficiency in at least one AI/ML framework (e.g., PyTorch,
    TensorFlow).
  - Solid programming skills in Python and/or other relevant
    languages.
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Experience deploying models to production environments.
  - Familiarity with distributed systems, cloud platforms, or
    MLOps tools.
  - Exposure to optimization techniques, model efficiency, or
    performance tuning.
