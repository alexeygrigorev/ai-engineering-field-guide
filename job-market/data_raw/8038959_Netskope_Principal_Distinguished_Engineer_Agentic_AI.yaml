  About Netskope
  
  Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise
  than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to
  dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that
  is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever
  it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network
  and Data Security.
  
  Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security
  company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of
  employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis,
  Bangalore, London, Paris, Melbourne, Taipei, and Tokyo. Our
  core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we
  purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting
  spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration,
  and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations
  to employee recognition events and social professional
  groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we
  strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.  Visit
  us at Netskope Careers. Please follow us on LinkedIn and
  Twitter@Netskope.
  
  About the team
  
  We are seeking an exceptional Principal Engineer to build
  next-generation security analytics and AI-powered
  capabilities within Netskope's platform. This is a high-
  impact individual contributor role for an engineer who
  excels at solving complex technical problems at the
  intersection of artificial intelligence, large-scale data
  systems, and cybersecurity.
  
  As a Principal Engineer, you will design and implement
  sophisticated systems that leverage cutting-edge AI/ML
  techniques, graph-based analytics, and real-time data
  processing to solve critical security challenges. You will
  work on problems spanning threat detection, risk assessment,
  behavioral analytics, and intelligent automation—building
  the systems that help security teams at the world's largest
  enterprises detect and respond to threats.
  
  What's in it for you
  
  This is your chance to work at the absolute intersection of
  Artificial Intelligence, large-scale Data Systems, and
  Cybersecurity. You won't just use existing tools; you will
  be designing and implementing sophisticated, cutting-edge
  systems that fundamentally change how enterprises detect and
  respond to threats.
  
  What you will be doing
  
  - Drive the enhancement of Agentic AI security capabilities,
    by enabling the continuous detection and posture
    management of sensitive or risky data. This includes data
    utilized in (but not limited to) training private LLMs or
    accessed and acted upon by public or multi-agent LLM
    systems
  - Improve the Agentic AI platform to extend seamless support
    to all major cloud infrastructures, on-prem deployments,
    and any new upcoming data or AI-centric technologies.
  - Provide technical leadership in all phases of a project,
    from discovery and planning through implementation and
    delivery.
  - Contribute to product development: understand customer
    requirements and work with the product team to design,
    plan, and implement features.
  - Support customers by investigating and fixing production
    issues.
  - Help us improve our processes and make the right tradeoffs
    between agility, cost, and reliability.
  - Collaborate with the teams across geographies.
  
  Required skills and experience
  
  - 14+ years of software development experience with
    enterprise-grade software.
  - Must have experience in building scalable, high-performance
    cloud services.
  - Expert coding skills in Scala or Java.
  - Development on cloud platforms including AWS.
  - Deep knowledge on databases and data warehouses (OLTP, OLAP)
  - Analytical and troubleshooting skills.
  - Experience working with Docker and Kubernetes.
  - Able to multitask and wear many hats in a fast-paced
    environment. This week you might lead the design of a new
    feature, next week you are fixing a critical bug or
    improving our CI infrastructure.
  - Cybersecurity experience and adversarial thinking is a plus.
  - Expertise in building REST APIs.
  - Experience leveraging cloud-based AI services (e.g., AWS
    Bedrock, SageMaker), vector databases, and Retrieval
    Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures is a plus.
  
  Education
  
  - BSCS or equivalent required, MSCS or equivalent strongly
    preferred
