  About Anthropic
  
  Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable,
  and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and
  beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our
  team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers,
  engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working
  together to build beneficial AI systems.
  
  About the role
  
  We believe skill with AI is fundamental to human agency.
  Education Labs builds the paradigms that help people become
  genuinely more capable—not just more engaged.
  
  This is a new kind of role: part researcher, part product
  builder, part interaction designer. You'll be the second
  technical builder on a small team studying how AI transforms
  human capability—and shipping features based on what we
  discover. You'll have significant creative license to define
  what "good" looks like, exploring new interaction patterns
  rather than optimizing existing ones.
  
  We're skeptical of tutorials, onboarding flows, and
  engagement metrics. We care about experiences that make
  users progressively more capable, curious, and empowered
  over time. This means integrating skill development into
  product design, using Claude itself as a capability-building
  partner, and measuring success by how users actually grow.
  
  You'll operate as a one-person technical shop: prototyping
  new ideas, establishing technical direction, and shipping
  production-quality features to millions of users. You'll
  need strong product instincts and clean interface design
  sensibilities, balanced with comfort in ambiguity and
  frontier thinking.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Ship features that help users develop real skill with
    AI—measuring success by capability growth, not time-on-
    site
  - Architect end-to-end prototypes (front-end and back-end)
    that test new interaction paradigms, with particular
    attention to the front-of-the-frontend: motion, polish,
    and interaction feel
  - Define technical direction for the team—establish patterns
    others can follow
  - Build relationships across Product, Design, and Research to
    influence how skill development principles shape
    Anthropic's broader product strategy
  - Shape team strategy and roadmap—identify the highest-
    leverage opportunities and build conviction across
    stakeholders
  - Translate research insights about skill development and
    human-AI collaboration into shipped product through close
    collaboration with researchers
  - Document and share your work through clear writing,
    prototypes, and presentations that influence thinking
    across the organization
  
  You may be a good fit if you have:
  
  Strong full-stack engineering with design sensibility
  
  - 6+ years building and shipping web products, with deep
    expertise across the stack
  - Strong front-end craft: TypeScript/JavaScript, React,
    CSS—with an eye for interaction design, motion, and visual
    detail
  - Solid back-end and data pipeline experience: Python, API
    design, analytics infrastructure
  - A portfolio showcasing innovative interaction designs and
    high-quality implementations
  - Track record of independently driving features from
    prototype to production
  
  Deep conviction about human capability
  
  - Strong perspective on how technology should enhance human
    capabilities rather than diminish them
  - Experience or genuine passion for skill development, HCI,
    developer tools, or products that help people become more
    capable
  - Skepticism of purely engagement-driven metrics; interest in
    measuring capability outcomes
  
  Research mindset with product execution
  
  - Comfort with ambiguity and exploring undefined problem
    spaces
  - Ability to rapidly prototype, test with users, and iterate
    toward production
  - Strong instincts for product design and user experience,
    even without formal design training
  
  Strategic leadership and coalition building
  
  - Experience setting vision, shaping team strategy, and
    building conviction across cross-functional stakeholders
  - Ability to build productive relationships with Product,
    Design, Research, and Engineering teams—especially when
    your team isn't the owner
  - Strong sense of prioritization—knowing what to build now,
    what to defer, and what to cut
  - Track record of influencing roadmaps and decisions beyond
    your immediate team
  
   Strong candidates may also have:
  
  - Experience in developer tools, creative tools, learning
    platforms, or other products where user skill development
    and mastery matter more than time-on-site
  - Background in learning sciences, cognitive science, HCI,
    skill acquisition research, or educational psychology
    (formal or self-directed)
  - Experience with experimentation frameworks, A/B testing, or
    analytics that measure capability development in
    production
  - Previous experience in research labs, frontier tech
    companies, or startups with high autonomy and ambiguity
  - Published writing, talks, or open-source work on skill
    development, human-AI interaction, or product philosophy
  - Experience building AI-native product experiences or working
    with LLMs in production contexts
  
  Strong candidates may also have

  What this role is not
  
  This is a hands-on technical role building product features,
  embedded within a research team. You'll provide technical
  guidance and help set direction, but this role doesn't
  involve people management off the bat. If you're looking to
  immediately transition into engineering management or lead a
  large team, this likely isn't the right fit.
  
  The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.
  
  For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target
  Earnings ("OTE") range, meaning that the range includes both
  the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base
  salary for the role.
  
  Annual Salary:
  
  $300,000—$405,000 USD

  Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's
  degree in a related field or equivalent experience.
  Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff
  to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.
  However, some roles may require more time in our offices.
  
  Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't
  able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every
  candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every
  reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an
  immigration lawyer to help with this.
  
  We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you
  meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates
  will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research
  shows that people who identify as being from
  underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing
  imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their
  candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself
  prematurely and to submit an application if you're
  interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones
  we're building have enormous social and ethical
  implications. We think this makes representation even more
  important, and we strive to include a range of diverse
  perspectives on our team. Your safety matters to us. To
  protect yourself from potential scams, remember that
  Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com
  email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted
  recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working
  on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other
  domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for
  money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

  position openings.
  
  How we're different
  
  We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big
  science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on
  just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact
  — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI
  — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We
  view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much
  in common with physics and biology as with traditional
  efforts in computer science. We're an extremely
  collaborative group, and we host frequent research
  discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-
  impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value
  communication skills.
  
  The easiest way to understand our research directions is to
  read our recent research. This research continues many of
  the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic,
  including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal
  Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI
  Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
  
  Come work with us!
