  About Unifize
  
  Unifize is an enterprise-grade AI-first operating system
  built for regulated operations, quality, and product
  development.
  
  We unify the essential functions that power regulated
  manufacturing — Quality (QMS), R&D, Manufacturing, and
  Maintenance (CMMS) — into a single collaborative platform.
  
  At Unifize, we don’t just build apps; we configure
  intelligent experiences that help teams collaborate faster,
  operate with compliance, and accelerate innovation.
  
  Qualifications:
  
  - Software and AI enthusiast. We should see proof of this!
  - You are a systems thinker.
  - You are fluent in English.
  - Basic coding skills are a plus. You will not write code,
    however, you will be working with engineers, databases,
    and no-code tools.
  - Implementation of an ERP, CRM, QMS, CMMS, PLM (or other
    enterprise software) is a plus.
  - Experience in quality management, manufacturing is a plus.
  - Fancy college degrees don’t impress us.
  
  More about you:
  
  - Committed to getting things done on time. (Read “Grit” by
    Angela Duckworth)
  - Ambitious. Wants to grow in a startup. Wants to self-improve
    continuously.
  - Be able to work on a flexible schedule.
  - Passion, enthusiasm, humour.
  - Ability to dive into details to solve problems and offer
    solutions.
  - Love to read and learn more everyday.
  - Have opinions and be able to convince others. Also be able
    to listen to others and be able to question those
    opinions.
  
  Job Responsibilities:
  
  - Unifize has built an incredibly flexible no-code platform
    that can be customized infinitely. Our customers need
    standardized configurations of the application for every
    use case we sell. And we add new use cases every month.
    This includes building workflows, automation scripts, AI
    agents, PDFs, dashboards, and help docs.
  - You will configure the Unifize application using the help of
    supervisor guidance, research, AI suggestions, competitor
    benchmarking, customer feedback, and our own best-in-class
    implementations (We will teach you how. You should enjoy
    learning.)
  - Build PDF templates as per the customer's requirement (We
    will teach you how)
  - Create automation specifications and coordinate with
    engineers to get it done (We will teach you how)
  - Troubleshooting non-technical issues raised by the team.
  - Reporting software defects and following up with the
    engineering team
  - Resolving customers’ questions
  - Undertake ad-hoc tasks or projects as required
  - Stay updated with product features and new releases
  - Attend occasional customer meetings online at night and take
    copious notes and create tasks for next steps. These might
    be implementation meetings but mostly sales demos.
  
  Growth Path:
  
  - Unifize will require product managers to refine and own end-
    to-end responsibility for the best solutions
  - A great solutions engineer will have a few growth paths
    available
  
  Interview tips: We will ask you these questions!
  
  - Research everything about Unifize.
  - Understand the role. What makes it hard? What makes it fun?
    How will you contribute to the organization within the
    first 30 days, 60 days, 90 days?
  - What improvements can you suggest for us? If you have no
    opinions, we don’t need you.
  - When you get an assignment, if it's too hard for you, please
    give up and go home. It only gets harder later.
  
  Hours & Compensation:
  
  - Shift: Regular daytime 9-6 or 10-7… with occasional late
    nights, especially to do customer calls (our customers are
    in the US)
  - You are expected to complete the tasks allotted to you -
    working hours are less important
  - INR 16 Lakh to 24 Lakh (CTC) based on experience and
    capability. This might stretch to 30 Lakh for exceptional
    candidates.
