  inside out. We’re the tech company behind Savvy, our
  licensed insurance agency, and we’re bringing clarity and
  ease to a space known for… the opposite. With powerful
  tools, clean design, and a customer-first mindset, we’re
  making insurance shopping refreshingly effortless.
  
  We’re a profitable, fast-growing Series A startup backed by
  General Catalyst, QED, NYCA, and Amex Ventures. As a remote-
  first team, we move quickly, experiment boldly, and build
  with intention.
  
  If you’re craving meaningful impact, energized by ambiguity,
  and are ready to build alongside exceptional teammates,
  you’re going to love doing your best work at Trellis.
  
  Position Overview
  
  As a Staff Software Engineer on the Conversational AI team
  at Trellis, you’ll play a critical role in shaping the
  future of our AI-driven customer experiences. You’ll
  architect and build intelligent systems that power natural,
  engaging conversations between users and our platform.
  Working closely with cross-functional partners, you’ll
  transform high-level product initiatives into scalable,
  well-tested technical solutions.
  
  You’ll lead the way on complex projects by defining scope,
  setting technical direction, and mentoring teammates along
  the way. You’ll guide the team through tough challenges,
  offer thoughtful code reviews, and contribute to a culture
  of continuous learning and collaboration. Whether you're
  onboarding new teammates or refining our LLM-driven
  infrastructure, you’ll be a key force behind our AI
  innovation. You will report directly into John Hartley, Head
  of Conversational AI.
  
  We believe in paying competitively for great work. As a
  remote team, we set our salaries at the 75th percentile of
  national market data in our industry. You can count on your
  pay being in line with (or above) the market. For this role,
  the base salary range is $220,000-$235,000. We review
  compensation twice a year to make sure we’re staying
  competitive and rewarding our team’s contributions.
  
  Who You Are
  
  - Meticulous: You pay attention to detail and take pride in
    what you deliver
  - Articulate: You succinctly and effectively communicate
    verbal and written technical and non-technical ideas and
    topics
  - Kind, not (just) nice: You provide tough feedback in a clear
    and concise manner that does not diminish or belittle the
    recipient
  - Opinionated: You bring strong opinions to discussions but
    are willing to change your mind when presented with new or
    better information
  - Product-minded: You focus on the “why” just as much as the
    “what” or “how”
  - Collaborative: You work within your team and cross-
    functionally to build consensus and achieve results
  - Autonomous: You are self-motivated, able to hold yourself
    accountable, and can generate high-value work with little
    direct supervision
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Own the ideation and execution of high-impact projects that
    directly influence the user experience and business
    outcomes
  - Flesh out and evolve the Conversational AI Engineering
    roadmap alongside product and technical leadership
  - Incept projects: identify opportunities, design solutions,
    and lead implementation
  - Guide integration efforts with external agencies and
    insurance carriers
  - Normalize, rank, and evaluate results using ML-based
    predictions to determine optimal user paths
  - Work closely with our Data Science team to leverage MLMs in
    tools like DataRobot for retention forecasting and
    decision logic
  - Ensure scalability and performance across the platform as we
    continue to grow
  
  What You’ll Need
  
  While you don’t need all of these to be successful in this
  role, we think you’ll be more successful the more you have
  
  - 7+ years’ experience developing software in a production
    environment
  - 4+ years’ experience in a senior engineer role
  - Ability to lead projects from conception through execution
