  Meet Ascertain
  
  Ascertain is building AI agents to automate the
  administrative work that burdens care teams. We are in major
  health systems and large specialty groups, saving hundreds
  of staff hours every week.
  
  Our backers include Northwell Health, New York’s largest
  health system, and Deerfield Management, a leading
  healthcare investment firm.
  
  Together, we’re on a mission to restore time, trust, and
  focus to the people who keep healthcare running. Our work is
  urgent — not because of startup timelines, but because our
  customers rely on us to drive financial resilience and
  operational clarity in a system under strain.
  
  About the Job
  
  As a Product Engineer - Voice AI at Ascertain, you will own
  the development and optimization of voice agents that
  automate healthcare back-office workflows. This is a hands-
  on role: you'll configure and iterate on voice systems,
  write production code when needed, and work directly with
  customers and our operations team to deeply understand user
  workflows and continuously improve performance.
  
  You'll be responsible for building reliable voice agents,
  establishing QA processes, analyzing call data, and using
  what you learn to optimize every aspect of how we deliver
  phone calls. Over time, you'll grow into owning the voice
  agent strategy for the organization.
  
  This role reports to the Head of Engineering and is based in
  our NYC or can be remote for the right candidate.
  
  What You'll Do
  
  - Build, configure, and optimize voice agents using third-
    party platforms and in-house tooling
  - Own quality assurance for voice interactions
  - Work directly with our operations team and customers to
    understand workflows, gather feedback, and translate
    insights into product improvements
  - Collaborate with engineers to build reliability and
    monitoring infrastructure as we scale
  - Write production code in Python to support integrations and
    custom functionality
  - Contribute to the broader product development process,
    bringing a user-centric perspective to everything we build
  
  What You'll Need
  
  - 3-4 years of experience in software engineering, with
    proficiency in Python
  - A track record of being deeply user and product-centric
  - Comfort with ambiguity and significant iteration; you're
    energized rather than frustrated by the process of getting
    something right through repeated refinement
  - High attention to detail, especially when it comes to edge
    cases and quality
  - Experience working cross-functionally with non-technical
    stakeholders
  - Familiarity with FastAPI, telephony platforms, or voice AI
    tools is a plus
  - Healthcare experience is preferred
  
  What You'll Bring to the Table
  
  - You're a builder who cares as much about the user experience
    as the technical implementation
  - You take ownership of outcomes, not just tasks
  - You communicate clearly and build trust with operations,
    engineering, and customers alike
  - You're excited to work at the intersection of product and
    engineering, and you see this blended role as a feature,
    not a compromise
  - You thrive in early-stage environments where scope evolves
    and you're expected to figure things out
  
  Benefits & Perks
  
  - Cutting-edge technology: Work directly with the latest
    advancements in generative AI and automation, tackling
    challenging problems that meaningfully impact healthcare
  - Ownership & growth: You'll join Ascertain at a pivotal early
    stage, shaping our products, technical direction, and
    culture, with significant opportunities for career
    advancement
  - Collaborative team: Join a talented, passionate, and
    supportive team with backgrounds from top tech companies
    and clinical institutions
  - Flexible hybrid work: We support a flexible hybrid working
    model from our NYC office, trusting you to manage your own
    schedule
  - Competitive compensation: We offer competitive salary,
    meaningful equity, comprehensive health insurance, and
    more

  directly impact healthcare organizations and improve patient
  care. Join Ascertain in transforming healthcare with AI!
