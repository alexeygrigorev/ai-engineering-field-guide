description: |
  At OakNorth, we’re building a bank for ambitious businesses,
  and we believe the next step-change in how we build software
  comes from AI-native engineering.
  
  The AI Enablement team exists to help product and
  engineering teams across the bank adopt AI practices and
  tools safely, effectively, and at scale, accelerating time-
  to-market while maintaining our high bar for quality,
  security, and reliability.
  
  This is a senior, hands-on engineering role for people who
  already build with AI as part of their daily workflow and
  want to help others do the same.
  
  Team Mission 🚀
  
  - The AI Enablement team multiplies impact across OakNorth
    primarily:
  - As enablers, we partner with product and engineering teams
    to adopt AI practices and tools safely and effectively by
    building internal platforms, agents, and workflows that
    eliminate friction and accelerate delivery throughout the
    software development lifecycle.
  - As builders, we experiment with and ship AI-native product
    features across OakNorth’s product portfolio. Proving
    what's possible, establishing patterns, and moving fast
    without a long-term ownership burden.
  
  The Role 👋
  
  - As a Senior AI-Native Engineer, you will design, build, and
    operate AI-powered systems that directly improve how
    software is developed and operated at OakNorth. At this
    level, you'll operate with significant autonomy, shape
    solutions end-to-end, and influence AI adoption across
    multiple teams.
  - Product ideation and discovery
  - Technical specification review and early feedback
  - Code generation, refactoring, and review
  - Documentation generation and maintenance
  - Test generation and quality validation
  - Observability, log analysis, and incident support
  - Experiment with AI-powered capabilities across our product
    portfolio
  - Move from concept to production quickly, proving what's
    possible
  - Establish reusable patterns and hand off to product teams
    for long-term ownership
  - Balance rapid experimentation with production-quality
    delivery
  - Agents that inspect logs and metrics to surface bugs, risks,
    or performance issues
  - Automated pull requests with proposed fixes or improvements
  - AI-assisted review of design documents and architectural
    decisions
  
  What We’re Looking For 🧠
  
  - Strong engineering fundamentals
  - 5+ years building and operating production systems
  - Comfortable working full-stack or with deep expertise in
    backend/platform engineering
  - Proven track record in designing and building systems used
    by other engineers
  - Strong product mindset: you measure success by outcomes and
    adoption, not just output
  - Skilled at rapid experimentation: you're comfortable with
    uncertainty, test ideas by shipping quick prototypes, and
    learn as much from failures as successes
  - Skilled at breaking down ambiguous problems into practical,
    scalable solutions
  - You're already in the habit of:
  - Using AI tools daily to accelerate your work (coding,
    debugging, reviews, documentation)
  - Treating AI as a collaborator in your workflow, not a
    novelty
  - Thinking in terms of agents, workflows, and automation
  - Iterating quickly: experiment → learn → refine → scale
  - Experience building or orchestrating AI agents or multi-step
    workflows
  - Familiarity with LLM APIs, prompt engineering, or tool-
    calling patterns
  - Background integrating AI into CI/CD pipelines,
    observability, or developer tooling
  - Experience working in regulated environments (financial
    services, security-sensitive systems)
  
  Technology 🧱
  
  - We’re pragmatic and evolving fast. Today, you’re likely to
    work with:
  - 🐍 Python
  - 🧠 LLMs & AI tooling (we're outcome-driven and vendor-
    agnostic)
  - 🗄️ PostgreSQL, BigQuery
  - 🎨 TypeScript, React
  - 🔧 pytest, Jest, CI pipelines
  - ☁️ AWS, GCP
  - 🚀 Docker, Terraform, GitHub Actions
  
  How We Expect You to Work 👷‍♀️
  
  - Enable, don’t block – you build platforms and tools that
    make other teams faster and more confident
  - Outcome-driven – success is measured through adoption, time-
    to-market, and quality improvements
  - Iterative by default – start small, validate value, then
    scale
  - Hands-on ownership – you build, ship, and operate what you
    create
  - Collaborative – you work across squads, disciplines, and
    seniority levels
  - Pragmatic about risk – especially when introducing AI into
    production and regulated systems
  
  How We Expect You to Behave ❤️
  
  - Curious, open, and generous with knowledge
  - Strong opinions, held loosely
  - Comfortable saying “this didn’t work, here’s what we
    learned”
  - No ego, impact matters more than ownership
  - Actively contribute to a psychologically safe, inclusive
    engineering environment
  
  What Makes Working Here Better 😍
  
  - This is a truly hybrid role, offering engineers the
    flexibility to work from home while also providing
    opportunities to collaborate in person with the team when
    it adds value. There’s no fixed requirement for days in
    the office, instead, we focus on creating space for
    engineers to engage meaningfully, whether that’s in-person
    for whiteboarding sessions or remote for deep focus work.
  - Work-life balance 🌴 - 25 days holiday (plus bank holidays)
    each year, and enhanced family leave allowances.
  - Competitive salary & equity 🏦 - We want people to have a
    serious stake in the business.
  - Good kit 💻 - Your choice of the best laptop, running macOS.
  - Team socials 🎉 - The opportunity to get to know each other
    outside of work.
  - Company socials 🥡 - A chance to catch up and meet new
    colleagues weekly over informal office breakfasts Lunches
    and dinners on OakNorth - or at our free barista bar every
    day.
  - Commuter support 🚲 - We offer the cycle to work and EV
    scheme.

  Our story
  
  OakNorth Bank was built on the foundations of frustrations
  with old-school banking. In 2005, when our founders tried to
  get capital for their data analytics company, the computer
  said ‘no’. Unfortunately, all major banks in the UK were
  using the same computer – and it was broken.
  
  Why was it so difficult for a profitable business with
  impressive cashflow, retained clients, and clear commercial
  success to get a loan?
  
  The industry was backward-looking and too focused on
  historic financials, rather than future potential.
  
  So, what if there was a bank, founded by entrepreneurs, for
  entrepreneurs? One that offered a dramatically better
  borrowing experience for businesses?
  
  No more what ifs, OakNorth Bank exists.
