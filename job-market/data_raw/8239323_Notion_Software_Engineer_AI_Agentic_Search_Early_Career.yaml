  About Us:
  
  Notion helps you build beautiful tools for your life’s work.
  In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides
  one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly
  connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with
  AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of
  users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota,
  Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and
  choose it because it helps them save time and money.  In-
  person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We
  require all team members to work from our offices on
  Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, our designated Anchor
  Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-
  office workdays.
  
  About The Role:
  
  We are seeking a software Engineer with at least 2-5 years
  of experience to work in the AI Connectors team. AI
  Connectors power AI agentic search, enabling customers to
  find answers across applications like Slack, Google Drive,
  Salesforce, and GitHub through Notion AI connectors. You'll
  build the end-to-end AI agentic search experience: Design
  and ship connectors from scratch, keeping third-party data
  continuously in sync. Build semantic search infrastructure
  powered by vector embeddings and efficient storage systems.
  Transform natural language questions into intelligent
  queries across multiple data sources. Implement ranking
  systems that surface the most relevant results while
  respecting user permissions and access controls. Scale to
  millions of documents across thousands of customers. You're
  a builder who thrives in fast-paced environments with a
  track record of shipping frequently.You have a strong
  foundation in distributed systems and data pipelines, with
  exposure to databases and production infrastructure. You
  write clean, maintainable code and are eager to take
  ownership of tasks with guidance. You make thoughtful
  technical decisions, ask the right questions when things are
  ambiguous, and learn quickly. You collaborate well with
  teammates and contribute to projects that power intelligent,
  agent-driven search experiences at scale.
  
  What You'll Achieve:
  
  - You’ll work with a team of engineers and cross-functional
    partners across product, design, data science, and user
    research to define a product strategy and drive execution
    through conception, research, implementation, and
    maintenance.
  - You’ll build and maintain foundational pieces of Notion’s
    building blocks, enabling a wide array of use cases in
    Notion such as docs, wikis, issue tracking, project
    management, and more.
  - You’ll contribute to the overall performance, reliability,
    and robustness of the Notion product, ensuring it scales
    elegantly across many dimensions.
  - You’ll partner with engineering leaders to identify and
    execute against high leverage technical investment that
    ensure the long-term flexibility and sustainability of our
    core systems.
  
  Skills You'll Need to Bring:
  
  - Proven track record of execution: You have at least 2 years
    of fullstack engineering experience, including building
    world-class product experiences alongside a team of
    engineers.
  - Shipping quality user interfaces: You partner closely with
    product and design to craft beautiful user experiences for
    large audiences, leveraging backend technologies. If
    you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid
    growth, that's a plus.
  - Building the team: You enjoy collaborating with both fellow
    engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a
    lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth, but
    also the growth, learning, and development of your
    teammates.
  - Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems
    holistically, starting with a clear and accurate
    understanding of the context. You think critically about
    the implications of what you're building and how it will
    impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity
    flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean
    solutions, while also balancing the business impact of
    what you’re building.
  - Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and
    programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be
    opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new
    technologies as you go.
  - Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas
    clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in
    writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements,
    you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and
    compromise when needed.
  - You don’t need to be an AI expert, but you’re curious and
    willing to adopt AI tools to work smarter and deliver
    better results.
  
  Nice to Haves:
  
  - You're proficient with any part of our technology stack:
    React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.
  - You have built or contributed to an internal platform or
    framework in the past.
  - You have experience driving teams toward shared goals and
    can balance business priorities with individuals’
    strengths, areas of interest, and career development
    goals.
  - You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace,
    Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why
    we're big fans of their work.
  - You have interests outside of technology, such as in art,
    history, or social sciences.
