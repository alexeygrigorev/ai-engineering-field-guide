  About the Role:
  
  We are seeking a visionary and hands-on Principal AI
  Engineer to be the foundational pillar of our strategy in
  the Content portfolio. You will be the catalyst who injects
  deep, modern AI expertise into our product portfolio. Your
  mission will be to research, architect, and pioneer the
  solutions that will process and extract intelligent insights
  from millions of unstructured documents and multi-media
  files every single day.
  
  This is a unique "founding engineer" opportunity to shape
  the future of AI within our company. You will be the primary
  AI/ML authority, responsible for identifying and
  implementing state-of-the-art techniques for document
  classification, entity extraction, image search, and more.
  If you are a seasoned engineer who thrives on solving
  massive-scale data challenges and wants to build a center of
  excellence from the ground up, this role is for you.
  
  What You’ll Do:
  
  - Spearhead AI Innovation: Act as the chief technical
    authority on AI, you will research, evaluate, and
    prototype cutting-edge solutions using Large Language
    Models (LLMs), Computer Vision, and other machine learning
    techniques to solve our most complex data extraction
    challenges.
  - Architect for Scale: Design and build robust, highly
    scalable, and cost-effective AI services and data
    processing pipelines. Your architecture will be the
    backbone for processing millions of documents daily with
    high reliability and throughput.
  - Tackle Real-World AI Challenges: Go beyond theory to
    systematically solve the practical problems of production
    AI. This includes managing LLM latency and variance,
    developing sophisticated prompt engineering strategies,
    and building fault-tolerant, defensive systems that
    perform consistently.
  - Be a Force Multiplier: Act as the key technical mentor and
    thought leader for our large engineering team and drive
    some mission-critical initiatives to production
  
  Who You Are:Core Qualifications
  
  - 12+ years of professional software engineering experience,
    with a proven track record of building complex, data-
    intensive, backend systems.
  - Deep expertise (5+ years) in building and scaling
    production-grade services using modern backend frameworks
    such as FastAPI, Django, Sanic, Spring Boot or similar.
  - Significant, hands-on experience (3+ years) in the complete
    lifecycle of AI/ML models: from experimentation and
    prototyping to deploying, monitoring, and iterating on
    them in a high-volume cloud environment.
  - Mastery in designing large-scale distributed systems,
    demonstrating strong knowledge of asynchronous patterns,
    streaming/queuing/caching strategies, and robust
    observability (logging, metrics, tracing).
  - Exceptional communication and leadership skills. You can
    articulate complex technical concepts to diverse audiences
    and have the ability to influence engineering direction
    across multiple teams without direct authority.
  
  Nice to have
  
  - Proficiency with modern DevOps and MLOps practices,
    including CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC),
    and automated testing frameworks.
  - Hands-on experience with containerization and orchestration
    technologies, particularly Docker and Kubernetes.
