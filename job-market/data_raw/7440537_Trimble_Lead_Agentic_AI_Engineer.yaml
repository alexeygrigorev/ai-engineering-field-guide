    businesses operate. We are building a foundational Agentic
    AI Platform to power these next-generation applications,
    and we're looking for passionate, experienced engineers to
    lead the way. What you will doAs a Full-Stack Software
    Engineer on the Agentic AI Platform team, you will be
    instrumental in building both the backend systems and the
    frontend interfaces that power our sophisticated AI
    agents. You will tackle challenging technical problems
    across the stack, implementing robust backend services,
    APIs, and scalable infrastructure, as well as developing
    intuitive user interfaces for internal tools, testing
    environments, or agent interaction components. You will
    contribute to the architectural direction, collaborating
    closely with backend specialists, frontend developers,
    designers, and AI researchers. This role requires strong
    software engineering fundamentals across both backend and
    frontend development, practical experience building
    scalable systems, and a keen interest or experience in
    modern AI technologies, especially Large Language Models
    (LLMs). 1. Full-Stack Development & Implementation:
    - Design, implement, test, and deploy robust backend
      components for the agentic AI platform (APIs, services,
      orchestration, data persistence) using languages like
      Python, Typescript, Java, etc. (Python highly relevant).
    - Design, implement, test, and deploy user-facing features and
      internal tools using modern frontend technologies,
      including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, HTML, and CSS.
    - Develop core libraries, SDKs, and components across the
      stack to enable efficient development and deployment of
      AI agents and associated tooling.
    - Write high-quality, maintainable, and well-tested code for
      both backend and frontend systems.
    - Implement and improve monitoring, logging, and alerting
      across the full stack.
    - Participate actively in code reviews for both frontend and
      backend code.
