  Overview:
  
  - Blue Yonder is looking for an experienced Sr Gen AI Engineer
    to contribute to the design, development, and
    implementation of agentic AI-driven solutions at Blue
    Yonder.
  - This role is not a research role and requires being hands-on
    and building agentic AI POCs from the ground up to
    demonstrate the “art of the possible” and business value.
  - The Sr Gen AI Engineer will design, prototype and deploy
    agentic AI solutions that address customer pain points
    across Blue Yonder’s global customer base.
  - This role will work on cutting-edge projects that push the
    boundaries of Generative AI and machine learning in the
    supply chain and retail domains.
  
  What you’ll do:
  
  - Design, build and rapidly iterate agentic AI solutions
    (including orchestration, MCP, A2A) logic and evals using
    proprietary/open source LLMs and open source agentic
    frameworks (Autogen).
  - Demo your solutions to wider business and to customers to
    get feedback and rapidly iterate to improve the solutions.
  - Collaborate with other team members and supply chain experts
    to refine Agentic AI solutions and customise your solution
    to improve fit to a given business problem.
  - Research and establish coding standards, best practices, and
    technical documentation for building reliable and
    trustworthy agents.
  - Evaluate and recommend new technologies to improve our
    development ecosystem.
  - Integrate AI solutions with our existing platform and
    products.
  
  What we are looking for:
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in computer science, Artificial
    Intelligence, Data Science, or a STEM related field.
  - Minimum 3+ years of experience in data science/machine
    learning/Gen AI with a strong understanding of the Gen AI
    development ecosystem.
  - MUST have strong proficiency in development using Python and
    ML libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn, Pytorch,
    transformers, Hugging Face, LangChain etc.)
  - Strong knowledge of LLMs, prompt engineering, RAG, LLM
    evaluations/ monitoring.
  - Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and
    Github.
  - Proven track record of shipping products powered by LLMs,
    RAG systems, and/or AI agents is a big plus.
  - Comfortable with working in a startup environment embedded
    within an enterprise.
  - Passion for pushing the boundaries of AI and a commitment to
    staying at the cutting edge of industry trends and
    technologies.
  - Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines and automated testing
    strategies.
  - Familiarity with monitoring, logging, and observability
    tools for LLMs.
  - Previous experience with working on data science problems in
    supply chain context
  - Strong communication skills and ability to explain complex
    technical concepts.
  - Contributions to open-source projects in the AI/ML space
