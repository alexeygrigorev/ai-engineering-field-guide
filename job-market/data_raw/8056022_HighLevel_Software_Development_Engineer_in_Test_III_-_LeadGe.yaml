  - Collaborate closely with engineering, product, LeadGen,

    lifecycle
  - Analyze failures across distributed systems using
    observability platforms (logs, metrics, dashboards) to
    identify root causes quickly
  - Advocate for shift-left quality and influence system design
    and architecture for better testability
  - Maintain accurate documentation and onboarding materials for
    frameworks, tooling, and best practices
  
  Requirements:
