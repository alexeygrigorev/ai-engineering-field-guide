  Job Description:
  
  Newsroom AI & Machine Learning Engineer
  
  February, 2026
  
  The Wall Street Journal newsroom is seeking a self-propelled
  Machine Learning Engineer to help build the future of an AI-
  empowered newsroom. Reporting to the Head of Newsroom Data
  and AI, this individual-contributor role sits within the
  newsroom and works at the intersection of engineering,
  product, audience and journalism.
  
  You will bring deep technical expertise in machine learning
  and generative AI, paired with strong product intuition and
  an understanding of newsroom culture and editorial
  standards. This role is ideal for someone who enjoys
  building and deploying new tools, is comfortable operating
  with ambiguity and is motivated by helping journalists do
  their best work.
  
  You will be an evangelist for responsible, high-quality AI
  use—ensuring brand safety, editorial integrity and reader
  trust – while partnering closely with teams across
  engineering, product and the newsroom to design, prototype
  and ship AI-powered tools for both journalists and readers.
  
  Key areas of focus include building experimental, reader-
  facing products that meet evolving audience needs;
  integrating generative AI into publishing, editing and
  distribution workflows; creating scalable tools that support
  reporting, research and newsroom operations; and identifying
  common needs across teams to develop flexible solutions that
  can be adopted broadly across the newsroom.
  
  You will:
  
  - Move quickly from idea to MVP, gather feedback from newsroom
    partners and iterate based on real-world use
  - Design, prototype, build and maintain AI-powered newsroom
    and audience-facing tools
  - Leverage LLM APIs and other AI services to solve editorial
    and product challenges
  - Experiment with emerging technologies and assess their
    applicability to newsroom needs
  - Work directly with journalists to understand pain points and
    translate them into technical solutions
  - Engineer reliable prompts and system instructions; evaluate
    and refine outputs for accuracy, fairness and adherence to
    editorial standards
  - Develop evaluation frameworks and quality checks to ensure
    outputs are production-ready
  - Analyze data from experiments to identify strengths,
    weaknesses, and opportunities for improvement
  - Write clear documentation to support adoption and long-term
    maintenance of tools
  
  You have:
  
  - At least 2 years of experience shipping production software
    or machine learning systems
  - Experience building and deploying tools used by end users,
    ideally in content, media, or information-driven products
  - Strong empathy for journalists and an understanding of
    newsroom workflows
  - Experience building modern web applications using
    JavaScript/TypeScript and contemporary frontend frameworks
    (e.g., React, Next.js, or similar)
  - Experience designing and consuming APIs to connect backend
    services with frontend applications
  - Proficiency in Python, AWS, Git,  and experience working
    with LLM APIs and modern AI tooling
  - Familiarity with generative AI techniques, evaluation, and
    responsible deployment
  - Experience working in or closely with a newsroom, media
    organization, or journalistic workflow is strongly
    preferred
  - Comfortable working independently, navigating ambiguity, and
    delivering MVPs that can be tested and iterated on

  early should a suitable candidate be identified
