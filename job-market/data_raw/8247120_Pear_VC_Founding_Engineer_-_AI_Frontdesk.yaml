  The Opportunity
  
  We're building the AI layer for America's 33M SMBs. Our
  growth is explosive. 10x last year, 20% MoM, raised $3M seed
  from Pear a few months ago, 300+ businesses using us today
  (1000+ by year-end). We've discovered a completely
  overlooked path to dominate this SMB market while everyone
  else is fighting over enterprise deals.
  
  Our Vision
  
  While conventional wisdom says SMBs are challenging (low
  contract values, high churn), we've discovered unique growth
  opportunities where others weren't looking. SMBs represent
  half of US GDP and need AI solutions as much as enterprises
  do. We're making that possible.
  
  Our early traction proves the model works - now we need the
  right product leader to help us scale. We started with AI
  receptionists and quickly expanded into something far more
  powerful. Our platform is the SMB Customer Revenue Engine -
  AI agents handling all conversations, an intelligence layer
  learning from every interaction, and outbound AI driving
  real revenue growth. Our vision is bold: to become the SMB
  super app—a single, intelligent platform that manages
  everything for SMBs, from customer acquisition to retention.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  You’ll be our first full-stack founding engineer, with an
  outsized role in how the product evolves. This is not a
  typical engineering role. You’ll write code, yes—but also:
  
  - Talk to customers
  - Jump on big deals
  - Unblock growth experiments
  - Influence the roadmap directly
  
  You’ll own features end-to-end, from prototype to scaling in
  prod. You’ll pair closely with the founder (ex-Meta) and PM
  (ex-Microsoft) to shape the company.
  
  In your first 90 days, you’ll:
  
  - Ship revenue-generating features used by hundreds of SMBs
  - Sit in on sales and support calls, and turn feedback into
    fast product iterations
  - Work across the stack (we’re on TypeScript, React, FastAPI,
    Postgres, Twilio, LiveKit)
  - Patch critical AI logic that makes or breaks call quality
  - Build internal tools that unlock GTM speed
  
  In 6 months, you’ll:
  
  - Own large product surface areas (e.g., lead capture
    workflows, analytics, integrations)
  - Drive adoption of your features across 1000+ businesses
  - Help land big deals by jumping on customer calls or
    prototyping something fast
  - Mentor new hires and shape engineering culture
  
  In 12 months, you’ll:
  
  - Architect key parts of our system
  - Be known by name to our biggest customers
  - Help close seven-figure deals with your product insights
  - Shape hiring, process, and velocity as we scale
  
  Who We Want
  
  - 2–5 years experience in fast-moving product engineering
    teams
  - Strong full-stack skills with experience shipping in
    production
  - Obsessive about customer needs—not just abstract “users”
  - Comfortable debugging, writing tests, talking to customers,
    and jumping on a Zoom demo—all in one day
  - Strong communicator—can pair with PMs, designers, and sales
  - NYC-based or willing to relocate (we work in-person out of a
    WeWork)
  
  Bonus
  
  - Experience with AI, Twilio, or voice/video APIs
  - Built tools for SMBs before (e.g., think Shopify,
    ServiceTitan, GoHighLevel)
  - Can hold your own in a sales conversation or onboarding call
  
  Compensation
  
  - Competitive salary & benefits
  - Generous equity
  - Unlimited PTO
  - Company-paid lunch/dinner in office
  
  Our Team You’ll join the founder (ex-Meta) and product lead
  (ex-Microsoft) in New York as one of the first on the
  ground—with plans to grow this hub to five in NYC in the
  next quarter. It’s early, high-impact, and you’ll help shape
  the future of the team.
  
  The rest of the company—12 people across engineering and
  customer success—is remote. Product and growth all run
  through NYC.
  
  We're located in the NYC and backed by leading investors
  like Pear Ventures, who were also the first checks into
  Doordash and Gusto.
  
  You’ll join a scrappy, ambitious team where product,
  engineering, and GTM run through the same room. It’s early,
  it’s fast, and it’s yours to shape.
