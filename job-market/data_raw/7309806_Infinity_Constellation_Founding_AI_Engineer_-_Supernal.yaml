  🚀 Founding Engineer — Supernal
  
  Remote (US & EU Friendly) | Full-Time | Equity + Salary
  
  Website: getsupernal.ai
  
  Supernal is building the operating system for businesses
  powered by AI employees.
  
  AI employees are here — and they’re redefining how
  businesses operate. At Supernal, we turn any tedious, manual
  process into an AI-powered workflow, managed through a
  delightful interface and accessible from web to phone.
  Businesses can now scale faster with smaller human teams
  empowered by large teams of AI employees.
  
  We believe this is a trillion-dollar opportunity. As a
  founding engineer, you'll help invent the infrastructure and
  interfaces that make it possible. Supernal has already
  reached multi-million dollar revenue within months, and
  we’re just getting started.
  
  Why This Role Exists
  
  We’re looking for a well-rounded, full-stack founding
  engineer to help us build robust AI systems and product
  experiences end-to-end. You’ll work directly with the
  founders on everything from core architecture to shipping
  new AI-powered features. If you’re a systems thinker, rapid
  builder, and care deeply about great UX and AI performance —
  we’d love to meet you.
  
  🔧 What You’ll Do
  
  - Architect and scale RAG pipelines, agent-based systems, and
    LLM-powered workflows
  - Fine-tune large language models for structured data
    extraction and automation
  - Build developer-friendly APIs and interfaces for web
    automation
  - Ship product features fast — with real usage and feedback
  - Work closely with product, design, and customers to build
    what matters
  - Stay ahead of the curve on LLM tools, embeddings,
    orchestration, and training
  - Create elegant, resilient systems that just work
  
  🌟 Who You Are
  
  - A full-stack engineer comfortable across Python/Django,
    React/TypeScript, or eager to learn fast
  - A system thinker who sees architecture, UX, performance, and
    product as a unified challenge
  - Obsessed with AI agents, LLMs, and building delightful
    automations
  - Comfortable wearing many hats: engineer, product thinker,
    debugger, owner
  - Thrive in fast-moving environments with a high degree of
    autonomy
  - A natural builder: you ship, you own, you iterate
  
  ✅ Bonus Points
  
  - Experience building LLM-based agents, fine-tuning models, or
    RAG pipelines
  - Contributions to open-source AI/ML projects
  - Experience with: TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis
  - You've trained or fine-tuned your own model from scratch
  - Worked on web automation, scraping, or structured data
    extraction before
  
  ✨ Why Join Supernal?
  
  - Founding role in a rocketship startup with real revenue and
    real usage
  - Ship fast: from idea to production in days, not months
  - Autonomy: own your work, your time, and your decisions
  - Remote-first across US and EU, with in-person offsites and
    workshops
  - Competitive salary + meaningful equity
  - Incredible teammates: builders, operators, musicians,
    filmmakers, and climbers
  - Backed by invisible.co, and founded by repeat entrepreneurs
  
  🧪 Our Interview Process
  
  We prefer to pay you for a week to build something real with
  us. We believe it’s the best way to evaluate fit, working
  style, and what it’s like to collaborate — for both sides.
  
  Supernal is for you if:
  
  - You’re a deep systems thinker
  - You constantly seek ways to grow yourself, your team, and
    the product
  - You want to leverage LLMs to produce what used to take
    entire teams
  - You care deeply about product excellence and technical
    elegance
  - You thrive when wearing many hats and solving unstructured
    problems
  - You value freedom and want to work from your favorite place
    on earth
  
  Supernal is not for you if:
  
  - You’re looking to clock in and clock out
  - You want to be told what to do
  - You prefer owning a narrow slice of the codebase
  
  If this sounds like you — let’s build the future together.
