  Senior AI-Enabled Software Engineer in Test
  
  eClinical Solutions is transforming clinical development
  with elluminate®, our Clinical Data Cloud, helping life
  sciences organizations unify, analyze, and unlock the value
  of their data faster than ever before. By combining a modern
  cloud platform with expert data services, we empower smarter
  decisions across the clinical trial lifecycle—accelerating
  innovation that ultimately improves patient outcomes.
  
  Our engineering teams build enterprise-grade, revenue-
  generating products at the intersection of cloud, data,
  analytics, and emerging AI technologies. If you’re excited
  about building sophisticated software that makes a real-
  world impact in healthcare, this is the place to do it.
  
  You will make an impact:
  
  As a Senior AI-Enabled Software Engineer in Test, you will
  play a critical role in modernizing and scaling our quality
  engineering practices and shaping the quality and
  reliability of elluminate, our flagship SaaS Clinical Data
  Intelligence Platform.
  
  You will lead the evolution of our test automation strategy,
  from framework design through CI/CD integration, making
  automation a driver of engineering velocity rather than a
  bottleneck. Your work will enable the shift from large,
  infrequent releases to continuous delivery with improved
  quality and production stability.
  
  You will also leverage AI and agentic capabilities to reduce
  manual testing, accelerate test creation, expand coverage,
  identify gaps, and increase release confidence.
  
  This position combines traditional automated testing with
  modern AI-driven observability and predictive capacity
  modeling, ensuring validated, audit-ready systems that
  comply with GxP, 21 CFR Part 11, and industry regulatory
  requirements. The role works cross-functionally with
  Engineering, DevOps, Data Management, and Quality teams.
  
  Accelerate your skills and career within a fast-growing
  company while impacting the future of healthcare.

  - Analyze test results, investigate failures, and partner with
    engineers to diagnose and resolve defects across
    distributed systems
  - Collaborate closely with developers and DevOps engineers to
    ensure new features are designed with testability,
    observability, and automation in mind
  - Continuously improve test data management, environment
    configuration, and reproducibility of test runs
  - Identify automation gaps and propose improvements that
    increase release cadence and reduce risk
  - Actively participate in architectural discussions, sprint
    planning, backlog grooming, and milestone reviews; partner
    with Engineering Leads to define scope, technical
    approach, deliverables, and quality criteria for upcoming
    releases
  - Contribute to documentation, standards, and best practices
    that elevate quality engineering across the organization
  - Ensure audit readiness by maintaining complete, traceable
    documentation in alignment with SOPs and Quality
    Management System (QMS)
