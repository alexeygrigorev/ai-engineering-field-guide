  legacy services using cutting-edge AI tooling while
  demonstrating what's possible when AI is deeply integrated
  throughout the development lifecycle.
  
  
  
  This is a hands-on engineering role focused on delivery.
  You'll ship modernised services in fast cycles while showing
  other engineers how AI transforms productivity and code
  quality.
  
  Your role in the Team's Success
  
  You will be part of a small team to start, 5-6 senior
  engineers and an embedded architect, and scale with
  contractors as needed based on the pipeline and
  opportunities. You will be hands-on in code using the latest
  in AI engineering practices.

    extract clean APIs
  - Work on high-impact legacy services that block divisional
    delivery speed
  - Implement strangler fig patterns and other proven migration
    approaches
  - Deliver modernised services with comprehensive tests,
    documentation, and multi-instance deployment capabilities
  
  
  
  Ship Results Quickly
  
  - Complete service modernisations in fast cycles with monthly
    milestones
  - Use AI to accelerate every phase: analysis, refactoring,
    testing, documentation
  - Hand off modernised services to Platform Services or
    divisions with clear ownership
  - Demonstrate measurable improvements: faster APIs, better
    performance, higher reliability
  
  AI Implementation & Automation (50%)
  
  Build AI-Powered Development Infrastructure
  
  - Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for service
    discovery, dependency mapping, and architecture compliance
  - Create AI-assisted CI/CD pipelines with automated code
    review, security scanning, and test generation
  - Build automation using Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and LLM
    APIs
  - Develop reusable AI tooling that other engineers can adopt
  
  
  
  Demonstrate AI-First Development
  
  - Use AI for all coding tasks: refactoring, test creation,
    documentation, debugging
  - Achieve measurable and significant productivity improvements
    through AI integration
  - Document patterns and share learnings through your work
  - Train teams during service handoffs on AI-enabled workflows
    you've built
  - Demonstrate when to use AI vs when human judgement is
    critical
  
  
  
   What you'll need for this role
  
  Backend Engineering
  
  - 8+ years software engineering with Java backend expertise
  - Experience modernising production systems at scale
  - Strong API design and microservices architecture knowledge
  - Understanding of strangler fig patterns, service
    decomposition, and legacy migration strategies
  
  
  
  AI Implementation (Critical Differentiator)
  
  - Hands-on experience building with Model Context Protocol
    (MCP)

  - Understanding of prompt engineering, model selection, and
    LLM capabilities/limitations
  
  
  
  Proven AI Impact
  
  - Achieved measurable productivity improvements using AI in
    development
  - Implemented AI-assisted refactoring, test generation, or
    documentation at scale
  - Experience with AI code analysis and automated remediation
  - Track record of shipping production systems built with AI
    assistance
  
  
  
  Culture & Leadership Style – What Matters Most
  
  - Delivery-focused: Ship working modernised services, don't
    just build tools
  - Hands-on: Write code daily, don't just architect or advise
  - Pragmatic: Use AI to go faster, not to be clever
  - Teacher through doing: Others learn by seeing your PRs and
