  About the Role:
  
  We are seeking a talented and motivated AI Engineer II who
  is best in class, with a high IQ and a high EQ. This role
  presents an exciting opportunity to thrive in a dynamic,
  fast-paced environment within a rapidly growing team, with
  strong prospects for continued growth and increased
  ownership.
  
  As an AI Engineer II on the Applied AI team, you will take
  on end-to-end ownership of complex platforms and systems
  that power Sezzle's AI-driven capabilities. Your work will
  span initiatives such as building AI-powered platforms from
  scratch, developing intelligent automation and orchestration
  systems, and embedding proprietary AI solutions directly
  into customer-facing products, internal tools, and
  operational workflows.
  
  You will operate in highly ambiguous problem spaces, working
  closely with product, engineering, and operations teams to
  identify opportunities where AI can drive meaningful impact
  — whether that's enhancing the customer experience,
  improving decision-making, or automating complex workflows.
  This role is ideal for engineers ready to move beyond scoped
  execution and into leading solutions: shaping architecture,
  driving implementation, and ensuring that what is built is
  reliable, scalable, and genuinely useful for both external
  users and internal teams.
  
  What You'll Do:
  
  - Lead the design, development, and ownership of AI-powered
    internal platforms and systems, including initiatives
    built from the ground up.
  - Own end-to-end delivery of complex projects, from problem
    discovery and system design through production rollout and
    iteration.
  - Design and implement AI-driven features, intelligent
    automation, and orchestration systems that enhance
    customer experiences and compound productivity across
    teams.
  - Embed AI capabilities into customer-facing products,
    internal tools, and operational workflows, ensuring
    solutions integrate naturally and deliver measurable
    value.
  - Build full-stack systems spanning backend services, APIs,
    data layers, and frontend interfaces.
  - Translate ambiguous business and operational problems into
    scalable, maintainable, AI-enabled technical solutions.
  - Apply strong systems thinking to ensure reliability,
    performance, security, permissions, and auditability
    across platforms.
  - Collaborate closely with engineers, teams, and stakeholders
    across the company to identify high-impact opportunities
    and drive adoption.
  - Participate in production support and incident response for
    owned systems, helping define and uphold reliability and
    operational best practices.
  - Mentor AI team members through code reviews, design
    feedback, and hands-on guidance, raising the overall
    quality bar of the team.
  
  What We Look for:
  
  - 3–5 years of professional experience in software
    engineering, AI engineering, platform engineering, or
    related roles.
  - Hands-on experience designing, building, and shipping AI-
    powered systems into production environments.
  - Strong proficiency in Python, SQL, and frontend frameworks
    such as React.
  - Proven experience designing and owning production-grade
    full-stack systems.
  - Experience working with distributed systems, internal
    platforms, or complex data workflows.
  - Ability to operate effectively in ambiguous problem spaces
    and drive solutions with minimal direction.
  
  Preferred Qualifications:
  
  - Experience building AI-first platforms or internal products
    from scratch, including early architectural decisions.
  - Strong foundation in core machine learning and data science
    principles, including supervised/unsupervised learning,
    feature engineering, model evaluation, and statistical
    inference.
  - Experience with transformer architectures (BERT, GPT, etc.)
    and understanding of attention mechanisms, tokenization,
    and fine-tuning strategies for domain-specific
    applications.
  - Experience developing AI-assisted or agentic systems that
    interact with tools, data, or workflows.
  - Familiarity with embeddings and vector representations,
    including text embeddings, similarity search, and
    integration with vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate,
    pgvector, or similar).
  - Experience with NLP techniques including text
    classification, named entity recognition, semantic search,
    and information extraction.
  - Familiarity with cloud-native development using AWS.
  - Understanding of prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG), and LLM application patterns.
  - Experience with containerized systems and orchestration
    tools such as Docker and Kubernetes.
  - Exposure to CI/CD pipelines and modern development workflows
    (e.g., GitLab).
  - Experience with Golang is a plus (or willingness to learn).
  
  About You:
  
  - You have relentlessly high standards - many people may think
    your standards are unreasonably high. You are continually
    raising the bar and driving those around you to deliver
    great results. You make sure that defects do not get sent
    down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay
    fixed.
  - You’re not bound by convention - your success—and much of
    the fun—lies in developing new ways to do things
  - You need action - speed matters in business. Many decisions
    and actions are reversible and do not need extensive
    study. We value calculated risk-taking.
  - You earn trust - you listen attentively, speak candidly, and
    treat others respectfully.
  
  What Makes Working at Sezzle Awesome:
  
  At Sezzle, we are more than just brilliant engineers,
  passionate data enthusiasts, out-of-the-box thinkers, and
  determined innovators. We believe in surrounding ourselves
  with only the best and the brightest individuals. Our
  culture is not defined by a certain set of perks designed to
  give the illusion of the traditional startup culture, but
  rather, it is the visible example living in every employee
  that we hire.
