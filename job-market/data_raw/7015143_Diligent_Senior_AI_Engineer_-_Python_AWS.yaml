  - Build and maintain Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    pipelines, including document ingestion, embeddings,
    vector search, and response orchestration.
  
  - Develop AI solutions using AWS Bedrock and related AWS
    services for secure and scalable model inference.
  
  - Build automated AI testing and evaluation frameworks to
    measure quality, performance, and reliability of LLM
    outputs.
  
  - Collaborate with Applied Scientists and Software Engineers
    to implement and productize AI-based capabilities.
  
  - Shape and evolve the team’s AI platform infrastructure,
    leveraging established architectural patterns and
    infrastructure-as-code practices.
  
  - Design and develop AI libraries and frameworks to accelerate
    value delivery across AI platform services.
  
  - Work on projects involving sensitive customer content used
    for Diligent customers’ board communications, requiring
    strong privacy and security controls.
  - Document and communicate your approach, progress, and
    results to the broader team and to other development
    teams.
  
  Required Experience / Skills
  
  - 5+ years of relevant experience in software engineering and
    AI-driven systems.
  
  - Strong ability to develop readable, maintainable, and well-
    tested Python code, following solid software engineering
    principles.
  
  - Proven hands-on experience with LLMs, including prompt
    engineering, RAG architectures, embeddings, and model
    evaluation.
  
  - Experience building and operating AI systems on AWS,
    preferably with exposure to AWS Bedrock.
  
  - Experience with infrastructure-as-code practices (AWS CDK
    preferred, or equivalent tools).
  
  - Ability to contribute effectively to a high-performing agile
    team and to product innovation.
  
  - Keen to continuously improve processes and share knowledge
    across the team.
