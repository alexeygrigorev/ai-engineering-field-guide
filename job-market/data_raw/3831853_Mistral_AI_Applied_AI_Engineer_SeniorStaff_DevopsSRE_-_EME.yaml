  About The Job
  
  Mistral AI is seeking an Applied AI Engineer focused on
  DevOps to facilitate the adoption of its products among
  customers and collaborate with them to address complex
  technical challenges.
  
  Applied AI Engineers, ML Infra at Mistral AI work directly
  with customers to quickly understand their greatest
  challenges and design and implement AI solutions. In this
  role, you’ll apply your problem-solving ability, creativity,
  and technical skills to help organizations use AI to drive
  real impact in the world. You’ll have the opportunity to
  gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the most
  important industries and institutions globally!
  
  Applied AI Engineers, ML Infra responsibilities look similar
  to those of a startup CTO: you’ll work in small teams and
  own end-to-end execution of high-stakes projects. A day
  might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers,
  wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app,
  speaking with customer executives, or establishing a
  strategy for the Applied Engineering team.
  
  What you will do
  
  • You’ll be responsible for onboarding customers on our
  products, providing guidance on deployment and integration,
  and ensuring the best production setup from the low-level
  GPU stack up to infrastructure, back-end and front-end
  interfaces.
  
  • You’ll work on deploying state-of-the-art AI applications
  from consumer products to industrial use cases, driving with
  our customers a crucial technological transformation.
  
  • You’ll work in collaboration with our researchers, other
  AI engineers, and product engineers on our most complex
  customer projects involving deployment, scaling, and
  contributing to our open-source codebases for tasks such as
  inference and fine-tuning.
  
  • You’ll be involved in pre-sales calls to understand
  potential clients' needs, challenges, and aspirations. You
  will provide technical guidance on our products and explain
  Mistral technologies to various stakeholders.

  • You are experienced with infrastructure as code (IaC)
