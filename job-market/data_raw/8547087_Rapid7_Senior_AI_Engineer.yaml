  About the Team The AI Center of Excellence is a
  multidisciplinary group of Data Scientists and AI Engineers
  who partner with Detection and Response teams to turn
  cutting-edge research into real-world security products. We
  leverage LLMs, agentic workflows, and behavioral modeling to
  stay ahead of evolving threats and ensure our customers
  remain secure. About the Role As a Senior Software Engineer
  - Data Science, your primary responsibility will be to drive
  the end-to-end delivery of ML and LLM-based solutions on
  AWS. Specifically, your focus will be to:
  
  - Design and implement sophisticated ML pipelines for security
    use cases, including malware detection and user behavioral
    analytics.
  - Architect and maintain RAG pipelines and agentic AI
    workflows using toolchains like LangChain and LangGraph to
    automate complex security tasks.
  - Optimize and deploy models within the AWS ecosystem,
    utilizing SageMaker and Bedrock while ensuring robust
    monitoring, drift detection, and retraining workflows.
  - Collaborate and mentor across the team to establish
    architectural standards, conduct code reviews, and support
    the technical growth of junior engineers.
  
  The skills and qualities you'll bring include: Core Skills
  
  - Technical Ownership: Ability to take a project from a
    conceptual prototype to a high-quality production system.
  - Analytical Problem Solving: Expertise in applying scientific
    computing and statistical modeling to unlabeled, large-
    scale data.
  - Continuous Learning: A proactive approach to mastering
    emerging technologies in LLMs, Generative AI, and agentic
    systems.
  
  Functional Skills
  
  - Python Proficiency: Advanced experience with numpy, pandas,

    HuggingFace, Transformers, LangChain, and LangGraph.
  - Cloud Infrastructure: Strong experience deploying and
    operating ML workloads on AWS (SageMaker, Bedrock, Lambda,
    EKS).
  - Vector Databases & RAG: Practical experience designing and
    tuning Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines.
  - MLOps & CI/CD: Proficiency in managing model registries,
    versioning, and automated deployment via GitHub Actions or
    Jenkins.
  - Security Domain Knowledge: Familiarity with threat
    detection, malware behaviour, or cybersecurity analytics.
  - Model Explainability: Ability to implement and interpret
    model transparency tools like SHAP or LIME.
  - LLM Evaluation: Experience using evaluation frameworks such
    as Promptfoo or HELM to ensure model quality and safety.
