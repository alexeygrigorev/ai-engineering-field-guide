  About the Role
  
  We are seeking a Senior Backend Engineer with a strong
  foundation in Java, solid Python capabilities, and hands-on
  experience building Agentic AI applications that integrate
  with Large Language Models (LLMs). This role blends
  traditional backend engineering expertise with next-
  generation AI agentic systems development, requiring not
  just system design skills, but also creativity in prompt
  engineering, AI product development and working with data-
  rich environments.
  
  You will contribute to the design and implementation of
  intelligent backend services that coordinate LLMs, agents,
  and data workflows to support enterprise-grade agentic
  systems.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Develop robust, scalable Java/Python based backend systems
    that enable the orchestration of Agentic AI workflows.
  - Develop state-of-the-art AI/ML models for solving real-world
    data management challenges such as entity resolution,
    classification, similarity matching, and anomaly
    detection.
  - Integrate LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Mistral, Claude, LLaMA) into
    backend pipelines to power autonomous or semi-autonomous
    decision-making.
  - Develop scalable ML workflows using Spark, MLlib, PyTorch,
    TensorFlow, or MLFlow, with seamless integration into
    production systems.
  - Translate business needs into technical design and
    collaborate with data scientists, product managers, and
    platform engineers to operationalize models.
  - Work closely with various stakeholders to design agent
    architectures and LLM toolchains (using frameworks like
    LangGraph, Crew AI, AutoGen, etc.).
  - Implement services and APIs that manage prompt chaining,
    tool invocation, and contextual memory for agents.
  - Collaborate with data engineers to ensure clean, efficient,
    and real-time access to structured and semi-structured
    data.
  - Apply prompt engineering best practices to improve agent
    behavior, task accuracy, and adaptability.
  - Monitor and optimize service performance, reliability, and
    scalability in production environments.
  - Continuously monitor and improve model performance using
    feedback loops, A/B testing, drift detection, and
    retraining strategies.
  - Contribute to code reviews, mentoring, and best practices
    for hybrid backend/AI development.
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  - 5+ years of overall experience in backend engineering, with
    strong proficiency in Java for scalable, distributed
    systems.
  - 2+ years of experience in developing and deploying machine
    learning models and AI products in production
    environments.
  - Experience in Agentic AI systems development using tools
    such as LangGraph, Crew AI, AutoGen, or similar.
  - Proficiency in Python (NumPy, scikit-learn, pandas,
    PyTorch/TensorFlow) and experience with large-scale data
    processing tools (Spark, Kafka, Airflow).
  - Experience integrating or orchestrating LLMs within business
    workflows or intelligent assistants.
  - Solid understanding of prompt engineering techniques (e.g.,
    system messages, chaining, tool invocation prompts).
  - Familiarity with data engineering concepts, including
    pipelines, data models, and ETL workflows.
  - Strong grasp of object-oriented design, data structures, and
    algorithms.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Experience with LLM orchestration frameworks (e.g.,
    LangChain, LlamaIndex, RAG pipelines).
  - Background in building microservices or backend systems for
    data-rich AI/ML platforms.
  - Experience with vector databases, embedding services, or
    semantic search integration.
  - Knowledge of cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure),
    containerization (Docker), and DevOps best practices.
  - Experience in developing LLM-powered agents, copilots, or
    task bots.
  
  What We Offer
  
  - Opportunity to work on cutting-edge backend and AI systems,
    including agentic automation and LLM innovation.
  - A flexible hybrid work model in our Bangalore office.
  - Competitive compensation with performance-based rewards.
