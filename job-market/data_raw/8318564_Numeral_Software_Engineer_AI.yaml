  About Numeral:
  
  Numeral is building the automation backbone for internet
  commerce — starting with the painful world of sales tax
  compliance. We handle everything from registration to
  remittance, delivering a white-glove service so e-commerce
  businesses can stay laser-focused on what they do best:
  growing their products, customers, and teams.
  
  We’re one of the fastest-growing companies from Y
  Combinator’s W23 batch, backed by top-tier investors
  including Benchmark Capital. Our team has deep roots from
  the early days at Stripe, Airbnb, Notion, and other breakout
  companies — and now we’re bringing that same level of craft,
  speed, and ambition to a space that’s long overdue for
  reinvention.
  
  Numeral is small but mighty. Growth is already borderline
  unmanageable — which means every hire we make now will
  directly shape the trajectory of the company. If you’re
  excited about joining as an early team member and want the
  kind of ownership that defines careers, we want to meet you.
  
  Mission:
  
  Running an online business today means wearing a thousand
  hats — most of them not the reason founders started their
  company. Our mission is to eliminate the administrative and
  accounting burdens that distract businesses from doing what
  they love.
  
  We’ve already helped hundreds of merchants avoid the
  headache of building giant finance teams just to manage tax
  compliance. Tomorrow, we’re scaling that impact even
  further: building the automation layer that lets internet
  businesses stay nimble, compliant, and future-proof.
  
  Numeral has raised over $57M, now serves over 2,500 paying
  customers and we have more than tripled our revenue every
  year in our history.
  
  About the role:
  
  We’re looking for a Foundational AI Engineer who thrives in
  ambiguity, enjoys building real-world AI systems end-to-end,
  and wants to define the technical and architectural
  foundations of an early-stage startup.
  
  This is a hands-on role for someone who wants to design and
  implement LLM-powered automation systems: model
  orchestration, tool calling, MCP-style integrations, agentic
  workflows, and automation-driven tooling, while being
  familiar with a traditional full-stack development
  environment. You should also extensively use AI-powered
  tools for development.
  
  You’ll work closely with product and leadership to
  concretize AI ideas into production-grade systems that
  customers rely on daily.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Design, build, and operate production AI systems, including
    tool-calling agents, model orchestration layers, and RAG.
  - Implement and maintain AI integrations using modern
    frameworks, MCP servers, and external model providers.
  - Build and evolve scalable backend services and APIs that
    power automated workflows and customer-facing features.
  - Think in automation and workflows: design systems using
    tools like n8n, Claude Code-style agents, or similar
    orchestration approaches where appropriate.
  - Make architectural decisions that balance latency, cost,
    reliability, and iteration speed.
  - Own infrastructure, observability, and performance for both
    AI and non-AI services.
  - Collaborate closely with product, design, and data teams to
    ship features that solve real customer problems.
  - Help define engineering best practices, AI
    safety/reliability norms, and our overall technical
    culture.
  
  Qualifications:
  
  - 7+ years of experience building products in high-growth
    environments.
  - 2+ years of experience building with LLMs.
  - Avid use of state-of-the-art AI development tools such as
    Cursor and Claude Code.
  - Fluency with backend technologies like PostgreSQL, Redis,
    and cloud services (AWS preferred).
  - Experience with frontend development, especially TypeScript
    and its ecosystem.
  - Strong product sense, balancing performance, flexibility,
    and speed.
  - Comfortable working in dynamic startup environments with
    evolving needs.
  - Excellent communication and collaboration skills.
  
  Bonus Points For:
  
  - Experience in payments, tax, accounting, or regulatory tech.
  - Experience with automation tools (n8n, Zapier-style systems,
    workflow engines) or building internal automation
    platforms.
  - Familiarity with MCPs, tool calls, agent frameworks, or
    model orchestration patterns.
  - Understanding of vector databases and concepts (such as
    Pinecone, HNSW).
