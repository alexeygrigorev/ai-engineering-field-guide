  Description At CDW, we make it happen, together. Trust,
  connection, and commitment are at the heart of how we work
  together to deliver for our customers. It's why we're
  coworkers, not just employees. Coworkers who genuinely
  believe in supporting our customers and one another. We
  collectively forge our path forward with a level of
  commitment that speaks to who we are and where we're headed.
  We're proud to share our story and Make Amazing Happen at
  CDW. Job Summary Design intelligent cyber defense. Automate
  response. Let security act at machine speed. The Senior
  Security Engineer II - Security Automation, AI &
  Orchestration is a hands‑on, high‑impact role within the
  Enterprise Defense & Automation (EDA) team. You will
  engineer automation‑first, AI‑assisted security capabilities
  that transform detection signals into real‑time,
  policy‑driven response and control actions. This role sits
  at the intersection of AI‑enabled security engineering and
  SOAR platforms. You'll help evolve security operations from
  "alert and investigate" to detect, decide, and act- reducing
  risk through scalable, resilient, and self‑healing
  automation. This is a builder and problem‑solver role.
  You'll design and implement SOAR workflows, detection logic,
  and automated response playbooks, integrating AI/ML‑driven
  insights to improve signal fidelity, decisioning, and
  response outcomes across detection, response, and control
  planes. Your work will directly influence how threats are
  prevented, contained, and remediated at scale. Success in
  this role requires strong security fundamentals, fluency
  across modern security platforms, and the ability to deliver
  production‑grade automation that operates reliably in
  real‑world, adversarial environments. If you're passionate
  about engineering intelligent security systems that think,
  respond, and defend autonomously, this role puts you at the
  forefront of modern cyber defense. What you will do Defense
  Automation Engineering (Primary) * Design, build, and
  maintain automation workflows that move security from detect
  and notify to detect, decide, and act. * Engineer reusable
  automation services and playbooks across identity, endpoint,
  network, cloud, and SaaS control planes. * Implement
  guardrails for automation and AI-assisted capabilities
  (confidence thresholds, blast‑radius controls, rollback
  mechanisms). * Develop custom integrations using Python,
  PowerShell, APIs, AI prompts, and event‑driven
  architectures. Secure‑by‑Construction Engineering * Design,
  build, maintain automation workflows, and AI-assisted
  capabilities that move security from detect and notify to
  detect, decide, and act. * Engineer reusable automation
  services and playbooks across identity, endpoint, network,
  cloud, and SaaS control planes. * Implement guardrails for
  automation and AI-assisted capabilities (confidence
  thresholds, blast‑radius controls, rollback mechanisms). *
  Develop custom integrations within the security stack.
  Signal‑to‑Action Orchestration * Partner with the Cyber
  Defense Engineering and Response team to integrate high-
  quality signals suitable for automation. * Map MITRE ATT&CK
  techniques to controls and automated responses once, then
  reuse globally. * Orchestrate cross‑pillar responses (e.g.,
  Identity → Endpoint → Network → Response). * Ensure
  automation outcomes are measurable, auditable, and
  resilient. Secure‑by‑Construction Engineering * Embed
  security controls into CI/CD pipelines for Enterprise
  Defense & Automation authored content. * Use policy-as-code,
  automate testing processes, and establish security gates
  that quickly block issues. * Eliminate repeat findings
  through native auto‑remediation patterns Resilience &
  Self‑Healing Infrastructure * Build automation that detects
  and corrects unsafe platform states without human
  intervention. * Develop self‑healing scenarios such as Risky
  identity state: restrict, rotate, expire, Endpoint
  degradation: auto‑repair or isolate, Control drift: rollback
  to known‑good state. Collaboration & Influence * Collaborate
  closely with Cyber Security platform owners, Threat
  Detection Response analyst, Business Unit owners *
  Contribute to shared backlogs and design reviews with clear
  ownership boundaries. * Document automation patterns,
  standards, and engineering decisions. What we expect of you
  * Bachelor's degree and 7+ years of experience in
  cybersecurity engineering, detection engineering, or
  automation‑focused security roles, OR * 11+ years of
  experience in cybersecurity engineering, detection
  engineering, or automation‑focused security roles. * Strong
  experience with security automation, orchestration, or SOAR
  platforms. * Proficiency in Python and/or PowerShell for
  production‑grade automation. * Designing secure, observable,
  and maintainable AI‑enabled solutions * Hands‑on experience
  with SIEM/XDR platforms and cloud‑scale security tooling. *
  Practical working knowledge of the MITRE ATT&CK framework
  and mapping detections to controls. * Built automation for
  large, diverse enterprise environments, a plus. *
  Familiarity with platforms such as Microsoft Defender,
  Microsoft Sentinel, CrowdStrike, Palo Alto XSOAR/XSIAM,
  Azure AD/Entra ID, Splunk, a plus. * Experience with CI/CD
  pipelines, infrastructure‑as‑code, and policy‑as‑code, a
  plus. * Background in detection engineering, threat hunting,
  or incident response, a plus. * Relevant certifications
  (GCIH, GCFA, Azure Security, cloud or automation
  certifications), a plus. Pay range: $132,000 - $190,600
  depending on experience and skill set Annual bonus target of
  10% subject to terms and conditions of plan Benefits
