  About the role
  
  At Everway, we're building AI capabilities that serve 250M+
  users and transform how 1,500+ employees work. We're looking
  for a Senior AI Engineer to be the founding engineer for AI
  Enablement — building MCP infrastructure, agentic workflows,
  and driving AI adoption across the business.
  
  This is a founding role with significant growth potential.
  You'll be the engineer who builds the core infrastructure
  that connects AI agents to our internal systems. You'll ship
  production solutions and contribute to the roadmap as the
  function evolves. As we scale, you'll have the opportunity
  to grow into a leadership position and help build a team.
  
  You'll build MCP servers that securely connect LLMs to
  Salesforce, Snowflake, Google Workspace, and internal tools.
  You'll develop agentic workflows that automate business
  processes across sales, marketing, customer success, and
  operations. And you'll work directly with stakeholders
  across the organisation to understand requirements and
  deliver working solutions.
  
  We've already demonstrated strong traction: 400+ weekly
  active AI users, tools delivering measurable ROI, and
  executive support for ambitious next steps. You'll join at
  the right moment to take on a critical growth area and make
  it your own.

  - MCP Development: Build and maintain Model Context Protocol
    servers that securely connect LLMs to enterprise systems
    (Salesforce, HubSpot, Snowflake, Google Workspace,
    internal APIs)
  - Agentic Workflow Development: Develop and ship production-
    grade agentic workflows with appropriate orchestration,
    guardrails, and observability
  - Systems Integration: Build robust, secure integrations
    between AI systems and enterprise tools, handling
    authentication, rate limiting, and data governance
    requirements ● Stakeholder Collaboration: Work with teams
    across Sales, Marketing, Operations, and Customer Success
    to understand automation needs and deliver solutions
  - Technical Documentation: Create documentation and reusable
    patterns that enable broader AI adoption across
    engineering teams
  - Grow with the Function: As we scale, help recruit and mentor
    team members to expand AI Enablement capabilities
  
  Essential Criteria
  
  - BSc in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related
    technical discipline (or equivalent practical experience)
  - 3+ years of software engineering experience, with meaningful
    exposure to AI/ML systems in production
  - Hands-on experience with MCP (Model Context Protocol) —
    you've built MCP servers or have deep familiarity with the
    architecture and specification
  - Experience building agentic AI systems: multi-step
    workflows, tool use, orchestration frameworks (LangGraph,
    CrewAI, or similar)
  - Strong production Python skills — API development, async
    programming, systems integration
  - Experience integrating with enterprise systems (CRM, data
    warehouses, productivity tools) via APIs
  - Solid engineering fundamentals: CI/CD, testing,
    containerisation, cloud deployment (AWS preferred)
  - Comfortable working autonomously and delivering in a fast-
    moving environment
  - Clear communicator — able to work with non-technical
    stakeholders and translate requirements into working
    solutions
  
  Desirable Criteria
  
  - Experience with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic,
    AWS Bedrock)
  - Interest in growing into team leadership and mentoring
  - Knowledge of AI governance, data protection, and responsible
    AI practices
