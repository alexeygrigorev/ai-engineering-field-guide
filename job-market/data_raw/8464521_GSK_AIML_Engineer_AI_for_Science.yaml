  At GSK, we see a world where advanced applications of
  Machine Learning and AI enable us to develop
  transformational medicines that drive better outcomes for
  patients at reduced cost and with fewer side effects. AI
  will also play a role in how we diagnose and use medicines
  to enable everyone to do more, feel better, and live longer.
  It is an ambitious vision that will require the development
  of products at the cutting edge of Machine Learning and AI.
  
  About the Role
  
  To strengthen our AI for Science (AI4S) team, we are looking
  for AI/ML Engineers with a track record in developing and
  validating machine learning models for real-world scientific
  problems. You will drive the development of AI models and
  agentic systems — researching, designing, implementing, and
  delivering solutions across a range of scientific tasks,
  including open-ended research questions, leveraging high-
  performance computing and the vast biomedical data sources
  available at GSK.
  
  Team Culture
  
  The AI4S team is built on the principles of ownership,
  accountability, continuous development, and collaboration.
  We hire for the long term, and we are motivated to make this
  a great place to work. Our leaders will be committed to your
  career and development from day one. We strongly encourage
  applications from people with diverse and underrepresented
  backgrounds and perspectives.
  
  In this role you will
  
  - Design and implement AI/ML-driven solutions throughout the
    entire model development life cycle.
  - Research and develop state‑of‑the‑art machine learning
    models and agentic systems to solve a variety of
    scientific tasks.
  - Deliver robust, tested, and high-performance code in an
    agile environment.
  - Liaise with experts in biology, medicine and experimentation
    to ensure optimal data collection and processing for
    machine learning models.
  
  Why you?
  
  Qualifications & Skills:
  
  We are looking for professionals with these required skills
  to achieve our goals:
  
  - Bachelor’s, Master’s or Doctorate degree in a quantitative
    or engineering discipline (computer science, computational
    biology, bioinformatics, engineering, among others); OR
    equivalent work experience delivering state-of-the-art
    AI/ML solutions.
  - Experience with at least one major deep learning framework
    (PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow).
  - Familiarity with machine learning literature and state-of-
    the-art approaches.
  - Experience developing and delivering robust software
    solutions, including demonstrated advanced programming
    expertise in Python.
  - Experience in software engineering and machine learning best
    practices, including version control, continuous
    integration (CI) and continuous development (CD),
    containerization, and shell scripting.
  - Fluency in English.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  If you have the following characteristics, it would be a
  plus:
  
  - Experience in design, development and deployment of
    commercial AI/ML software.
  - Experience with Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agentic AI
    (e.g., tool use, multi-agent orchestration, deployment and
    evaluation).
  - Contributions to relevant open-source projects.
  - Relevant scientific publications in AI/ML (e.g., NeurIPS,
    ICML, ICLR, AAAI), computational biology or bioinformatics
    venues.
  - Knowledge of or interest in disease biology, molecular
    biology and medicine.
  - Experience working with biomedical data (e.g., genomics,
