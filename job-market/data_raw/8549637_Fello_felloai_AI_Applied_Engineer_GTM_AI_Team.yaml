  About Fello:
  
  Fello is a profitable, hyper-growth, VC-backed B2B SaaS
  startup building the AI operating system for modern GTM
  teams.
  
  We are not adding AI as a feature. We are rebuilding how
  marketing, sales, and operations work from the ground up
  using autonomous agents, LLM-native workflows, and real-time
  data systems. Our AI agents research accounts, enrich data,
  make decisions, and execute workflows autonomously. Our goal
  is simple: automate as much operational and cognitive work
  as possible.
  
  We move fast, ship constantly, and adopt new AI capabilities
  as soon as they emerge. If you want to build real AI systems
  that operate inside a live, revenue-generating company, this
  is the place.
  
  This is a builder role.
  
  About You:
  
  You are an AI-native builder. You don’t just use AI tools;
  you build agents, copilots, and autonomous systems. You
  understand how modern LLMs actually work: tool use,
  reasoning loops, structured outputs, retrieval, memory, and
  orchestration. You are comfortable vibe-coding, shipping
  fast, and learning new AI tooling weekly. You’ve built side
  projects, internal tools, or production systems using LLMs,
  agents, or automation frameworks. You think in systems, not
  scripts. You’ll be responsible for building AI agents and
  systems that directly improve revenue, efficiency, and
  scalability across our company. You know that the leverage
  of a single great AI builder today is 10–100x a traditional
  engineer. This is a remote role with the option to work
  anywhere in India.
  
  You Will:
  
  - Design and deploy autonomous AI agents that can research,
    reason, and execute real business workflows
  - Build agentic systems using modern LLM capabilities
    including tool use, function calling, structured outputs,
    and multi-step reasoning
  - Create internal AI copilots used daily by marketing, sales,
    operations, and leadership
  - Implement retrieval systems (RAG) using embeddings and
    vector databases to give agents context and memory
  - Build AI workflows that can enrich accounts, qualify leads,
    generate insights, and automate execution
  - Integrate AI agents deeply into our stack: HubSpot, internal
    databases, enrichment platforms, and product systems
  - Automate workflows that previously required human
    operational effort
  - Build scraping, parsing, and AI extraction systems to
    convert unstructured web data into structured intelligence
  - Rapidly prototype, test, and deploy new AI capabilities as
    new models and tools become available
  - Continuously improve agents to make them faster, smarter,
    cheaper, and more reliable
  - Build reusable internal frameworks, tools, and agent
    architectures
  - Own systems end-to-end — from idea to production
  
  You Have:
  
  - Strong software engineering ability and the ability to ship
    working systems quickly
  - Hands-on experience building with modern LLMs and AI tools
    (OpenAI, Anthropic, open models, or similar)
  - Experience building AI agents, copilots, or automated
    workflows
  - Strong prompt engineering skills and understanding of
    structured prompting and reliability
  - Experience integrating APIs, webhooks, and external systems
  - Ability to work with structured and unstructured data
  - Experience with automation tools like N8N, Make, Zapier, or
    similar
  - Comfort working with web scraping, enrichment systems, and
    data pipelines
  - Strong builder mindset — you learn fast, experiment fast,
    and ship fast
  - High agency — you figure things out without needing step-by-
    step instructions
  - Curiosity and obsession with new AI capabilities
  - Bonus: Experience with vector databases, embeddings, or
    retrieval systems
  - Bonus: Experience building multi-step agent workflows
  - Bonus: You actively build AI projects outside of work
  - Bonus: You use AI coding tools as part of your daily
    workflow
