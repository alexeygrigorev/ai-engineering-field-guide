  About Anthropic
  
  Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable,
  and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and
  beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our
  team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers,
  engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working
  together to build beneficial AI systems.
  
  About Beneficial Deployments:
  
  Beneficial Deployments ensures AI reaches and benefits the
  communities that need it most. We partner with nonprofits,
  foundations, and mission-driven organizations to deploy
  Claude in education, global health, economic mobility, and
  life sciences — focusing on raising the floor for those who
  need it most.
  
  About the Role:
  
  We're looking for an Applied AI Engineer to join our
  Beneficial Deployments team, focused on maximizing the
  impact of Claude in the life sciences. Our goal is
  ambitious: accelerate scientific progress from R&D through
  translation by an order of magnitude. That means making
  Claude the go-to tool for the life sciences ecosystem from
  early discovery in academia to paradigm shifting biotech to
  reimaging pharma pipelines  — and building the technical
  infrastructure to back that up.
  
  You'll work directly with flagship research partners like
  Howard Hughes Medical Institute and The Allen Institute,
  embedded in their scientific workflows. This isn't
  consulting from the outside — you'll be building alongside
  their engineers, prototyping agents that fit into real
  research pipelines, and developing the ecosystem-level
  tooling (MCP servers, benchmarks, reusable agent skills)
  that extends Claude's usefulness across the broader life
  sciences community. This role will be part of the founding
  Beneficial Deployments applied AI team focused on bringing
  more of life sciences closer to the frontier and be
  responsible for building with our partners.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Partner deeply with flagship life sciences research
    institutions — understand their scientific workflows end-
    to-end, build hands-on with their engineering teams, and
    help take projects from early exploration to production
    systems integrated into how they do science day-to-day.
  - Develop reusable ecosystem infrastructure, like MCP servers
    for domain-specific data sources (genomics platforms,
    literature databases, experimental repositories),
    instruments, scientifically-grounded benchmarks, and agent
    skills that other institutions can adopt without starting
    from scratch.
  - Identify what's actually hard about deploying AI in life
    sciences (heterogeneous data, auditability requirements,
    the prototype-to-trust gap) and feed those findings back
    to product, engineering, and research.
  - Create technical content and documentation that lets
    partners self-serve, so what works for one institution can
    scale globally without the same level of hand-holding.
  
  You Might Be a Good Fit If You Have:
  
  - 4+ years as a Software Engineer, Forward Deployed Engineer,
    or technical founder — with production experience shipping
    systems that real users depend on.
  - Deep research experience in life sciences, biomedical
    research, or scientific computing. Bonus if you've studied
    genomics, neuroscience, or drug discovery specifically and
    are comfortable getting deeply technical with academics.
  - Experience building LLM-powered tools or applications:
    prompting, context engineering, agent architectures,
    evaluation frameworks.
  - Builder credibility from shipping production code as a
    software engineer, forward-deployed engineer, or technical
    founder.
  - A scrappy mentality–comfortable wearing multiple hats,
    building from scratch, driving clarity in ambiguous
    situations, and doing whatever it takes to further the
    mission.
  
  The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.
  
  For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target
  Earnings ("OTE") range, meaning that the range includes both
  the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base
  salary for the role.
  
  Annual Salary:
  
  $280,000—$320,000 USD
  
  Logistics
  
  Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's
  degree in a related field or equivalent experience.
  Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff
  to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.
  However, some roles may require more time in our offices.
  
  Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't
  able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every
  candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every
  reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an
  immigration lawyer to help with this.
  
  We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you
  meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates
  will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research
  shows that people who identify as being from
  underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing
  imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their
  candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself
  prematurely and to submit an application if you're
  interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones
  we're building have enormous social and ethical
  implications. We think this makes representation even more
  important, and we strive to include a range of diverse
  perspectives on our team. Your safety matters to us. To
  protect yourself from potential scams, remember that
  Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com
  email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted
  recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working
  on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other
  domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for
  money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

  position openings.
  
  How we're different
  
  We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big
  science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on
  just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact
  — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI
  — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We
  view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much
  in common with physics and biology as with traditional
  efforts in computer science. We're an extremely
  collaborative group, and we host frequent research
  discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-
  impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value
  communication skills.
  
  The easiest way to understand our research directions is to
  read our recent research. This research continues many of
  the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic,
  including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal
  Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI
  Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
  
  Come work with us!
  
  Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in
  San Francisco. We offer competitive compensation and
  benefits, optional equity donation matching, generous
  vacation and parental leave, flexible working hours, and a
  lovely office space in which to collaborate with colleagues.
