  About the opportunity:
  
  As a Senior AI Engineer, you will be at the forefront of our
  Generative AI initiatives. We treat AI as a software
  engineering discipline. You will be responsible for the full
  lifecycle of our AI features—specifically document
  intelligence and RAG pipelines—taking them from initial
  prototype to robust, scalable production services. You will
  solve for real-world constraints like latency, error
  handling, and cost optimization.
  
  You’ll collaborate with a diverse range of clients to
  translate business needs into high-performance AI
  architectures. This role requires a blend of deep technical
  expertise in LLMs and a disciplined Software Engineering
  approach to ensure our solutions are robust, ethical, and
  scalable.
  
  What You Will Do:
  
  - Architect & Build: Design and implement end-to-end GenAI
    applications using Python, LangChain, and LlamaIndex on
    Google Cloud.
  - Engineer for Precision: Develop advanced RAG (Retrieval-
    Augmented Generation) pipelines and Semantic Search
    systems using GCP Vector Search or Pinecone.
  - Optimize Models: Lead efforts in LLM and Embedding fine-
    tuning to improve domain-specific performance.
  - Agentic Ops: Build and manage agentic workflows that
    automate complex multi-step reasoning tasks.
  - Collaborate & Innovate: Work directly with customers to
    understand requirements, suggest novel features, and
    implement state-of-the-art AI techniques.
  - Productionize: Apply MLOps best practices to ensure models
    are served efficiently, monitored, and continuously
    improved.
  
  Your Technical Toolkit:
  
  - Core Languages: Mastery of Python and shell scripting.
  - AI/LLM Ecosystem: Extensive experience with Google Gemini,
    GPT-4, or LLaMA; deep knowledge of Prompt Engineering and
    Fine-tuning.
  - Data & Search: Expertise in Vector Databases (Vertex AI
    Vector Search, pgvector, etc.) and implementing Semantic
    Search.
  - Infrastructure: Hands-on experience with GCP (Vertex AI) and
    building scalable software architectures.
  - Frameworks: Proficiency in LangChain, LlamaIndex, or similar
    orchestration layers.
  - Mindset: A strong software engineering foundation—you write
    clean, maintainable code and understand the full SDLC.
  
  Basic Qualifications:
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science,
    Engineering, or a related technical field.
  - Proven track record of deploying GenAI products to a
    production environment.
  - Experience with Classic Machine Learning (neural nets,
    training, tuning) is a strong plus.
  - Knowledge of Data Engineering and SQL.
  
  Personal Attributes:
  
  - Ownership: You take pride in your code and see projects
    through from concept to deployment.
  - Curiosity: The AI landscape changes weekly; you are a
    lifelong learner who stays ahead of the curve.
  - Consultative Spirit: You enjoy interacting with clients and
    can translate technical complexity into business value.
  - Ethics: You prioritize responsible AI development and data
    privacy.
