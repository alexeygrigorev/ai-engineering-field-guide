  Position Overview
  
  We are hiring an AI Engineer to build, fine-tune, deploy,
  and scale large language model–based systems. The role
  focuses on LLM optimization, backend API development, and
  MLOps, including RAG pipelines, efficient model serving, and
  automated evaluation. You’ll work on taking LLMs from
  experimentation to production-ready, scalable AI solutions.
  
  
  
  ShyftLabs is a growing data product company that was founded
  in early 2020 and works primarily with Fortune 500
  companies. We deliver digital solutions built to help
  accelerate the growth of businesses in various industries,
  by focusing on creating value through innovation.
  
  Job Responsibilties:
  
  - Design and implement traditional ML and LLM-based systems
    and applications
  - Optimize model inference performance and cost efficiency
  - Fine-tune foundation models for specific use cases and
    domains
  - Implement diverse prompt engineering strategies
  - Build robust backend infrastructure for AI-powered
    applications
  - Implement and maintain MLOps pipelines for AI lifecycle
    management
  - Design and implement comprehensive traditional ML and LLM
    monitoring and evaluation systems
  - Develop automated testing frameworks for model quality and
    performance tracking
  
  Basic Qualifications:
  
  - 4–8 years of relevant experience in LLMs, Backend
    Engineering, and MLOps.
  - LLM Expertise
  - Model Fine-tuning: Experience with parameter-efficient fine-
    tuning methods (LoRA, QLoRA, adapter layers)
  - Inference Optimization: Knowledge of quantization, pruning,
    caching strategies, and serving optimizations
  - Prompt Engineering: Prompt design, few-shot learning, chain-
    of-thought prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation
    (RAG)
  - Model Evaluation: Experience with AI evaluation frameworks
    and metrics for different use cases
  - Monitoring & Testing: Design of automated evaluation
    pipelines, A/B testing for models, and continuous
    monitoring systems
  - Backend Engineering
  - Languages: Proficiency in Python, with experience in
    FastAPI, Flask, or similar frameworks
  - APIs: Design and implementation of RESTful APIs and real-
    time systems
  - Databases: Experience with vector databases and traditional
    databases
  - Cloud Platforms: AWS, GCP, or Azure with focus on ML
    services
  - MLOps & Infrastructure
  - Deployment: Experience with model serving frameworks (vLLM,
    SGLang, TensorRT)
  - Containerization: Docker and Kubernetes for ML workloads
  - Monitoring: ML model monitoring, performance tracking, and
    alerting systems
  - Evaluation Systems: Building automated evaluation pipelines
    with custom metrics and benchmarks
  - CI/CD: MLOps pipelines for automated testing, and deployment
  - Orchestration: Experience with workflow tools like Airflow.
  
  Preferred Qualifications:
  
  - LLM Frameworks: Hands-on experience with Transformers,
    LangChain, LlamaIndex, or similar
  - Monitoring Platforms: Knowledge of LLM-specific monitoring
    tools and general ML monitoring
  - Distributed Training and Inference: Experience with multi-
    GPU and distributed training and inference setups
  - Model Compression: Knowledge of techniques like
    distillation, quantization, and efficient architectures
  - Production Scale: Experience deploying models handling high-
    throughput, low-latency requirements
  - Research Background: Familiarity with recent LLM research
    and ability to implement novel techniques
  - Tools & Technologies We Use
  - Frameworks: PyTorch, Transformers, TensorFlow
  - Serving: vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, SGlang,  OpenAI API,
  - Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Docker, AWS/GCP
  - Databases: PostgreSQL, Redis, Vector DBs
  
  We are proud to offer a competitive salary alongside a
  strong insurance package. We pride ourselves on the growth
  of our employees, offering extensive learning and
  development resources.
