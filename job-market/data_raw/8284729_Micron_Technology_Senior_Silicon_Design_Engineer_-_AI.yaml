  Our vision is to transform how the world uses information to
  enrich life for all.
  
  Micron Technology is a world leader in innovating memory and
  storage solutions that accelerate the transformation of
  information into intelligence, inspiring the world to learn,
  communicate and advance faster than ever.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Architect, design, and implement AI/ML-driven workflows for
    DRAM/NAND memory subsystems and controllers.
  - Improve design and layout efficiency through AI-based
    automation, leveraging Python and LLMs (e.g., Claude,
    Gemini).
  - Perform block- and chip-level simulations, debugging, and
    functional verification.
  - Collaborate closely with design and CAD teams to develop and
    customize tools that accelerate design qualification and
    turnaround time.
  - Apply industry-standard EDA tools such as Cadence Verisium,
    Virtuoso Layout Suite, Siemens Solido (Variation-Aware
    Design), and other leading tools for synthesis,
    simulation, parasitic estimation, and layout-aware
    optimization.
  - Develop standard cell layout automation using Python and
    SKILL programming.
  
  Required Skills – Data Science & AI
  
  - 4–8 years of proven experience applying AI/ML techniques in
    the semiconductor design domain (analog, digital, layout,
    and/or verification).
  - Strong foundation in Mathematics of Optimization and core
    machine learning algorithms, including neural networks.
  - Hands-on experience implementing reinforcement learning (RL)
    or related optimization techniques for design or EDA
    problems.
  - Practical experience building LLM-based solutions,
    including:
    - Fine-tuning
    - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
    - Pre-training or adapting LLMs for domain-specific use cases
  
  Required Skills – Silicon Design
  
  - Strong understanding of CMOS fundamentals, device physics,
    timing, power, and memory architectures.
  - Experience with simulation and verification environments
    such as Virtuoso, Xcelium, ModelSim, Solido, or equivalent
    EDA platforms.
  - Working knowledge of SystemVerilog and UVM methodology.
  - Familiarity with Cadence and Synopsys toolchains is highly
    desirable.
