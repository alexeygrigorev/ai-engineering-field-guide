  About Qumis
  
  Qumis is a venture-backed AI startup building the most
  advanced platform for reading and interpreting insurance
  policies. We help P&C insurance professionals—claims
  advocates, brokers, underwriters, and legal teams—move
  faster, make better decisions, and reduce reliance on siloed
  expertise. Our customers include some of the largest
  insurance organizations in the U.S.
  
  We combine legal-grade natural language understanding with
  structured analysis and intuitive workflows to modernize one
  of the most complex and outdated parts of the insurance
  industry: reading the policy. Our vision is a world where
  anyone can read any insurance policy like a lawyer.
  
  We’re a small, high-trust team of engineers, designers, and
  insurance/legal experts. We move fast, operate with
  autonomy, and hold each other to a Michelin-star standard.
  We value grit, speed, ownership, clarity of thinking, and
  deep curiosity. If you're energized by building at the edge
  of AI, transforming massive legacy industries, and working
  with people who care deeply—welcome.
  
  About the Role
  
  We're hiring a Founding Staff AI Engineer to build and ship
  production-grade AI that powers the core workflows of Qumis.
  You’ll partner closely with the CTO and co-founders to
  design, implement, and own every part of our AI
  pipeline—from unstructured document ingestion to interactive
  LLM outputs that shape legal-grade decisions.
  
  It’s a product-critical role for someone who thrives in
  ambiguity, ships fast, and is excited to be the technical
  owner of a new AI stack inside a real-world, high-stakes
  domain.
  
  You’ll play a key role in shaping our architecture, roadmap,
  and engineering culture. Your work will touch every
  customer, every week.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Build and ship production AI features end-to-end—from R&D to
    SaaS integration, observability, and iteration
  - Design and deploy advanced document understanding systems,
    including RAG pipelines, clause segmentation,
    summarization, risk detection, and more
  - Create scalable APIs that deliver real-time coverage
    analysis, comparisons, and recommendations inside a modern
    SaaS UI
  - Engineer robust data workflows across OCR, PDF ingestion,
    parsing, normalization, and embedding generation
  - Own evaluation and observability, from automated accuracy
    pipelines to human-in-the-loop systems that maintain trust
    and reliability
  - Design for explainability—develop transparent workflows that
    help legal, claims, and compliance professionals
    understand what the AI sees and says
  - Collaborate across disciplines with designers, PMs, and
    domain experts to translate insurance workflows into AI-
    powered systems
  - Set technical direction—you’ll shape our infra, tooling, and
    AI product roadmap from the ground up
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  This role blends the ambition of a research scientist, the
  urgency of a product engineer, and the ownership of a
  founder. You’ll be our first AI hire, helping architect and
  scale our AI systems from the ground up. You should bring
  most or all of the following:
  
  - 6–10+ years of experience building and deploying production
    machine learning systems, with a focus on NLP, document
    intelligence, or unstructured data
  - Strong track record shipping ML models into production—API
    design, observability, iteration, and scaling included
  - Deep experience with RAG pipelines, multi-step LLM
    workflows, and vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate,
    Qdrant)
  - Comfortable working with complex, messy documents (e.g.,
    insurance policies, contracts), including parsing, OCR,
    clause-level segmentation, and normalization
  - Strong software engineering background, with experience in
    fullstack dev, containerization (Docker), and DevOps/MLOps
    best practices
  - Ability to design secure, compliant systems in regulated
    environments (insurance, legal, healthcare, or finance)
  - Experience architecting agentic workflows and AI-native
    products that go beyond simple chatbot interfaces
  - Product-first mindset—you build models to solve real user
    pain, and love working closely with cross-functional teams
  - Operates like a founder—driven, hands-on, scrappy, and
    thrives in fast-paced, zero-to-one environments with
    extreme ownership
