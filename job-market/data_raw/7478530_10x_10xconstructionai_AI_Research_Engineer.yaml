description: |
  Drive the next wave of generative and multimodal
  intelligence that powers our autonomous robots.
  
  As a core member of the AI Research team you'll turn
  cutting-edge, vision-language and diffusion advances into
  robust real-time systems that see reason and act on dynamic
  construction sites.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  * Research & innovate diffusion-based generative models for
  photorealistic wall-surface simulation, defect synthesis and
  domain adaptation.
  
  * Architect and train Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and
  Vision-Language Alignment (VLA) objectives that connect
  textual work orders, CAD plans and sensor data to pixel-
  level understanding.
  
  * Lead development of auto-annotation pipelines (active
  learning, self-training, synthetic data) that scale to
  millions of frames and point-clouds with minimal human
  effort.
  
  * Optimize and compress models (INT8, LoRA, distillation)
  for deployment on Jetson-class edge devices under ROS 2.
  
  * Own the full lifecycle—problem definition, literature
  review, prototyping, offline/online evaluation and
  production hand-off to perception & controls teams.
  
  * Publish internal tech reports and external conference
  papers; mentor interns and junior engineers.
  
  Qualifications & Skills
  
  * 3+ years in deep-learning R\&D or Ph.D./M.S. in CS, EE,
  Robotics or related field with strong publication record.
  
  * Demonstrated expertise in diffusion models (DDPM, LDM,
  ControlNet) and multimodal transformers / VLMs (CLIP,
  BLIP-2, LLaVA, Flamingo).
  
  * Proven success building large-scale data-centric AI
  workflows—active learning, pseudo-labeling, weak
  supervision.
  
  * Advanced proficiency in Python, PyTorch (or JAX),
  experiment tracking and scalable training (PyTorch
  Lightning, DeepSpeed, Ray).
  
  * Familiarity with edge-AI runtimes (TensorRT, ONNX
  Runtime), and CUDA / C++ performance tuning.
  
  * Strong mathematical foundation (probability, information
  theory, optimization) and ability to translate theory into
  production code.
  
  * Bonus: experience with synthetic data generation in Isaac
  Sim or robotics perception stacks (ROS2, Nav2, MoveIt 2,
  Open3D).
  
  Why join us?
  
  * Own breakthrough tech from idea to autonomous robot on
  active job-sites—your work leaves the lab fast.
  
  * Collaborate cross-functionally with perception, controls,
  and product teams & publish at top venues with company
  support.
  
  * Shape an industry by replacing dangerous, repetitive
  construction labor with intelligent robots.
  
  * Competitive salary + equity, hardware budget, flexible
  hybrid work, and a culture that prizes deep work and rapid
  iteration.
