  Type: Remote, Full-timeRole Overview
  
  As an Applied AI Engineer(Automation), you will deliver
  high-impact AI and automation solutions for clients—owning
  work from requirements discovery through prototype and
  production deployment. You’ll build reliable, maintainable
  systems that integrate LLMs into real business workflows via
  APIs, automation platforms, and backend services.
  
  This is a mid-to-senior individual contributor role. You’ll
  collaborate closely with Solutions Architects,
  Delivery/Engagement leads, and Product Managers to scope,
  build, ship, and iterate on client solutions.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Design & Deploy: Design, develop, and deploy tailored AI and
    automation solutions aligned to client objectives.
  - Build Workflows & Services: Translate business problems into
    production-grade AI workflows and services using Python,
    automation tools (n8n/Make/Zapier or similar), and LLM
    platforms/APIs (e.g., OpenAI, IBM watsonx.ai, Amazon
    Bedrock), plus retrieval systems.
  - Agentic Systems: Build and deploy agentic workflows using
    LangChain, LangGraph, and Google ADK, including tool
    calling and structured outputs.
  - Retrieval & Knowledge Systems: Implement RAG pipelines using
    vector databases and search technologies (e.g., Pinecone,
    Elasticsearch, pgvector) and graph databases when
    appropriate.
  - Prototype → Production: Ship fast prototypes, then harden
    them into scalable systems (testing, reliability,
    deployment, monitoring) independently or with a team.
  - Client Partnership: Participate in discovery, run technical
    calls/demos when needed, and communicate tradeoffs clearly
    to client and internal stakeholders.
  - Ongoing Support & Iteration: Improve deployed solutions
    through feature work, bug fixes, monitoring, prompt/model
    improvements, and additional automations.
  - Documentation: Produce clear technical documentation, client
    demos, and internal playbooks to enable reuse and
    scalability.
  - Continuous Learning: Stay current on LLM tooling and
    delivery best practices to improve quality and speed.
  
  Success in This Role Looks Like
  
  - Solutions consistently meet or exceed client expectations
    and show measurable impact (time saved, cost reduced,
    improved conversion/deflection, faster cycle time).
  - Clients trust you as a go-to engineering partner and expand
    usage of deployed AI workflows.
  - Deliveries are production-ready: monitored, testable,
    documented, and maintainable.
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  - 3–8 years of software or AI engineering experience (mid-to-
    senior).
  - 2–3+ years of AI Automation, Generative AI, or Agentic AI
    (mid-to-senior).
  - Strong Python engineering skills and experience building
    APIs/services (e.g., FastAPI).
  - Hands-on experience integrating LLMs (e.g., OpenAI APIs or
    equivalents), including prompt design, structured outputs,
    and basic evaluation practices.
  - Experience with at least one workflow automation platform
    (n8n, Make, Zapier, or similar) and building reliable
    integrations.
  - Familiarity with RAG fundamentals and retrieval systems
    (embeddings, vector search); exposure to vector databases
    and/or Elasticsearch.
  - Production engineering fundamentals: Docker, cloud
    deployment (AWS/GCP/Azure/IBM), and experience with
    async/queuing patterns (e.g., Celery, Redis, Kafka).
  - Comfort operating in a client-facing environment: technical
    calls, demos, and collaborating with cross-functional
    stakeholders.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Experience with fine-tuning LLMs or other ML models; broader
    ML exposure is a plus (not required).
  - Familiarity with observability and tracing (e.g., LangSmith,
    OpenTelemetry) and prompt/version lifecycle management.
  - Experience with graph databases / knowledge graphs.
  - Familiarity with data governance and AI governance concepts
    (PII handling, auditability, access controls, risk
    awareness).
  - Prior consulting experience or work in fast-paced startup
    environments.
