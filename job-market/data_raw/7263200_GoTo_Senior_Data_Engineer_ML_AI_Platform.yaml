  Your Day to Day
  
  As a Senior Data Engineer – ML / AI Platform you would be:
  
  - Design, build, and optimize scalable batch and near-real-
    time data pipelines using PySpark, SQL, Airflow, and
    Databricks/AWS services.
  - Develop and maintain data models (conceptual, logical,
    physical) for structured and semi-structured datasets.
  - Work with Delta Lake, Hive, and Lakehouse architectures to
    manage large-scale datasets efficiently.
  - Implement data quality, governance, observability, and
    security best practices across pipelines.
  - Participate in architecture discussions around scalability,
    reliability, and cost optimization.
  - Mentor junior engineers and contribute to data platform and
    engineering best practices.
  - Design, build, and deploy ML/AI solutions end-to-end for
    real SaaS use cases (e.g., recommendations,
    churn/retention, usage intelligence, anomaly detection,
    automation).
  - Partner with external teams like product, sales, marketing
    etc to translate business problems into deployable ML
    solutions.
  - Own ML productionization: feature pipelines,
    training/inference workflows, model packaging, deployment,
    and monitoring.
  - Implement and maintain MLOps pipelines (model versioning,
    retraining strategies, performance tracking, and rollback
    mechanisms).
  - Integrate models into data platforms and downstream
    applications with reliability and observability in mind.
  - Apply pragmatic ML choices - prioritizing business impact,
    simplicity, and maintainability over complexity.
  - Collaborate with platform and infra teams to optimize cost,
    scalability, and reliability of ML workloads.
  - Mentor and technically guide engineers in building,
    deploying, and operating ML/AI solutions in production
    SaaS environments.
