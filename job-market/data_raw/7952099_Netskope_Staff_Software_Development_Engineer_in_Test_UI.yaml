  About Netskope
  
  Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise
  than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to
  dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that
  is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever
  it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network
  and Data Security.
  
  Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security
  company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of
  employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis,
  Bangalore, London, Paris, Melbourne, Taipei, and Tokyo. Our
  core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we
  purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting
  spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration,
  and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations
  to employee recognition events and social professional
  groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we
  strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.  Visit
  us at Netskope Careers. Please follow us on LinkedIn and
  Twitter@Netskope.
  
  About the role:
  
  Please note, this team is hiring across all levels and
  candidates are individually assessed and appropriately
  leveled based upon their skills and experience.
  
  We are seeking a highly skilled and motivated Quality
  Engineer to join our Agentic AI team. In this role, you will
  be a custodian of quality for our cutting-edge agentic AI
  platform & set of  security agents developed on that. You
  will be instrumental in ensuring the reliability,
  scalability, and security of a platform that handles complex
  data across diverse cloud and on-premise environments.
  
  This is not just a testing role; it's an opportunity to
  influence the entire development lifecycle of Agentic AI.
  We're looking for a proactive engineer who can identify gaps
  and advocate for best practices, from unit and integration
  testing within the development team to comprehensive end-to-
  end validation. The ideal candidate is comfortable diving
  deep into a complex architecture, creating robust test
  strategies, and executing both manual and automated tests to
  perfection.
  
  What's in it for you:
  
  Work at the forefront of Agentic AI, solving novel quality
  challenges inherent in Agentic Systems and LLMs. This is a
  chance to move beyond standard QA and define reliability and
  safety standards for next-generation security products. You
  will be instrumental in ensuring the reliability,
  scalability, and security of a platform designed to handle
  vast, complex data across diverse cloud and on-premise
  environments.
  
  What you will be doing:
  
  - Design and execute comprehensive test plans for new
    features, covering everything from UI and APIs to backend
    processes and data integrations for the Agentic platform.
  - Develop and maintain robust automation frameworks. You'll
    expand our UI testing with Playwright and build out our
    API and backend testing capabilities to ensure full
    coverage.
  - Create a framework for Evaluation pipeline which other teams
    can use to plug and play the test cases for their agents
  - Test across complex environments, including onboarding cloud
    accounts (AWS, Azure, GCP), interacting with various data
    stores and lakes, and validating on-premise integrations.
  - Validate critical background jobs, such as long running
    agents, agentic workflows, data scans, classification, and
    alert generation, ensuring they are accurate and
    performant at scale.
  - Own and evolve our regression and smoke testing suites to
    ensure release readiness and maintain product stability.
  - Act as a quality champion, partnering with the development
    team to improve test coverage by identifying needs for
    better unit and integration tests.
  - Develop strategies to manage testing across a wide variety
    of data store versions and types, ensuring our product
    remains compatible and reliable.
  - Handle customer escalations, perform root cause analysis,
    and drive issues to resolution from a quality engineering
    perspective.
  - Engage in cross-functional team standups to prioritize
    tasks, communicate progress, and collaborate to meet
    deadlines.
  
  Required skills and experience:
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering,
    or a related field.
