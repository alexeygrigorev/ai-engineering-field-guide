  Wing, backed by top-tier Silicon Valley VCs), dedicated to

    end, back end, and data layers cohesively meet product

    pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI)
  - Deploy and manage containerized services (Docker,

  - Monitor application health, implement logging, and handle
    on-call duties for mission-critical issues
  - 5. Rapid Prototyping & Iteration
  - Work in short, iterative development cycles to quickly
    prototype new features, gather feedback, and refine
    solutions
  - Be prepared to pivot quickly based on user feedback or
    changes in the product direction
  - 6. Security & Best Practices
  - Follow secure coding guidelines and employ best practices
    like input validation, encryption, and role-based access
    control
  - Collaborate with the team to ensure compliance with data
    protection policies (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) as required by
    specific domains
  - 7. Working with LLMs
