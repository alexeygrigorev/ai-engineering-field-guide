  Ship production ML and agentic AI powering market leaders
  worldwide
  
  Boam AI builds managed data solutions that transform messy,
  unstructured signals from public, private, and proprietary
  sources into structured, reliable, and always up-to-date
  intelligence on millions of SMBs and enterprises worldwide.
  These agentic systems power CRMs, data warehouses, AI
  products, and mission-critical decisions across the
  enterprise.
  
  As an Applied AI Engineer, you will own the lifecycle of the
  models and agents that power our product. You will build and
  maintain ML data pipelines, develop production-ready LLM-
  and agent-driven features, and work closely with backend
  engineers to integrate models into real systems. This is a
  role for someone who has shipped ML to production, wants
  real ownership over models and pipelines, and is excited to
  work on a small, senior team where AI is at the core of the
  product.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Own the ML model lifecycle from training and evaluation to
    deployment
  - Build and maintain ML & agentic data pipelines for training,
    inference, and monitoring
  - Develop production-ready agentic and large-language-
    model–driven features
  - Integrate models into production systems in close
    collaboration with backend engineers
  - Implement experiment tracking, model CI/CD, and automated
    retraining
  - Improve performance, reliability, and observability of ML
    and AI systems in production
  - Work with product and data teams to turn ambiguous problems
    into concrete ML/AI solutions
  - Use next-gen AI tools to improve iteration speed and model
    quality
  
  You Might Be a Fit If...
  
  - 3+ years of ML engineering experience working on production
    systems
  - Strong Python skills and hands-on ownership of end-to-end ML
    pipelines or agentic systems
  - Comfortable with data preprocessing, feature engineering,
    and evaluation at scale
  - Familiarity with LLMs or modern foundation models
  - Experience with common ML tooling (e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow,
    XGBoost, vector DBs, experiment trackers)
  - Comfortable working across APIs, data stores, and
    infrastructure, not just notebooks
  - Bias to ship, measure, and refine rather than chase perfect
    offline metrics
  - Motivated by solving real customer problems and seeing
    models used in the wild
  - Thrive without heavy process, QA buffers, or endless
    safeguards – you own what you ship
  
  Why Boam AI
  
  - Join a no-politics, high-trust, low-ego, and high-talent
    team
  - Work on mission-critical ML/AI systems used by top-tier
    enterprise customers
  - Work directly with founders, the Head of Engineering, and
    senior engineers on problems that matter
  - High autonomy, real impact, and clear ownership from day one
  - Operate at the intersection of AI, data infrastructure, and
    enterprise workflows
  - Top-tier compensation with meaningful equity upside
  - Help shape the ML/AI platform, patterns, and practices you
    can be proud of
