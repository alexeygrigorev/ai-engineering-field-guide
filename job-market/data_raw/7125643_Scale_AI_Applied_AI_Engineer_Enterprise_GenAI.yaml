  AI is becoming vitally important in every function of our
  society. At Scale, our mission is to accelerate the
  development of AI applications. For 8 years, Scale has been
  the leading AI data foundry, helping fuel the most exciting
  advancements in AI, including: generative AI, defense
  applications, and autonomous vehicles. With our recent
  Series F round, we’re accelerating the usage of frontier
  data and models by building complex agents for enterprises
  around the world through our Scale Generative Platform
  (SGP).
  
  The SGP ML team works on the front lines of this AI
  revolution. We interface directly with clients to build
  cutting edge products using the arsenal of proprietary
  research and resources developed at Scale. As an Applied AI
  Engineer, you’ll work with clients to create ML solutions to
  satisfy their business needs. Your work will range from
  building next-generation AI cybersecurity firewalls to
  creating transformative AI experiences in journalism to
  applying foundation genomic models making predictions about
  life-saving drug proteins. Daily data-driven experiments
  will provide key insights around model strengths and
  inefficiencies which you’ll use to improve your product’s
  performance. If you are excited about shaping the future of
  the modern AI movement, we would love to hear from you!
  
  You will:
  
  - Own, plan, and optimize the AI behind our Enterprise
    customer’s deepest technical problems
  - Leverage SGP to build the most advanced AI agents across the
    industry including multimodal functionality, tool-calling,
    and more
  - Have experience gathering business requirements and
    translating them into technical solutions
  - Meet regularly with customer teams onsite and virtually,
    collaborating cross-functionally with all teams
    responsible for their data and ML needs
  - Push production code in multiple development environments,
    writing and debugging code directly in both our customer’s
    and Scale’s codebases.
  - Be able and willing to multi-task and learn new technologies
    quickly
  
  Ideally you'd have:
  
  - A love for solving deeply complex technical problems with
    ambiguity using state of the art research and AI to
    accomplish your client’s business goals
  - Strong engineering background: a Bachelor’s degree in
    Computer Science, Mathematics, or another quantitative
    field or equivalent strong engineering background.
  - Deep familiarity with a data-driven approach when iterating
    on machine learning models and how changes in datasets can
    influence model results
  - Experience working with cloud technology stack (eg. AWS or
    GCP) and developing machine learning models in a cloud
    environment
  - Proficiency in Python to write, test and debug code using
    common libraries (ie numpy, pandas)
  
  Nice to haves:
  
  - Strong knowledge of software engineering best practices
  - Have built applications taking advantage of Generative AI in
    real, production use cases
  - Familiarity with state of the art LLMs and their
    strengths/weaknesses
