  About Us
  
  Parity is one of the world’s most experienced companies
  building the core infrastructure behind blockchain — the
  system that allows information and value to be shared
  securely without needing an intermediary. We’re laying the
  foundation for a better web which respects the freedom and
  data of individuals, and empowers developers to build
  better, more trustworthy online services.
  
  Our remote-first, global team develops open-source software
  that anyone can use or improve. This includes Polkadot,
  Polkadot SDK, and Kusama — key parts of the Web3 tech stack,
  the next generation of the internet. Our mission is to make
  Polkadot the most active and innovative community in
  blockchain, powering a new era of connected and
  decentralised applications.
  
  About the Team
  
  This role sits in our Acceleration department, home to the
  people who drive ecosystem growth by building tools,
  integrations, and partnerships across the Polkadot network.
  
  Reporting into our Product Research Lead, you’ll be joining
  the Product Engineering team. We shape the product vision
  and roadmap, translating ecosystem needs into tools and
  experiences that accelerate platform adoption.
  
  About the Role
  
  As a Product Engineer, you will lead the end-to-end delivery
  of features, from initial problem discovery to production
  deployment. This role is designed for a self-directed
  builder who prioritizes "what" to build as much as "how" to
  build it. You will leverage an AI-native workflow to iterate
  rapidly and deliver high-impact solutions to complex user
  problems.
  
  What you’ll do
  
  - Full-Lifecycle Ownership: Lead feature development through
    scoping, architecture, deployment, and iteration based on
    live user data.
  - AI-Augmented Development: Integrate AI tools (e.g., Cursor,
    Copilot, Claude) into your daily workflow to accelerate
    velocity and maximize output.
  - Autonomous Decision-Making: Navigate ambiguity by exercising
    sound product judgment, filling requirement gaps without
    waiting for exhaustive specifications.
  - Rapid Iteration: Deploy MVPs quickly to gather real-world
    feedback, avoiding over-engineering in favor of momentum
    and validated learning.
  - Direct Collaboration: Partner with stakeholders and users to
    deeply understand pain points and translate them into
    functional, scalable software.
  - Cross-Functional Execution: Work proactively across the
    organization to remove blockers and maintain a high
    shipping cadence.
  
  Your Skills
  
  - Proven experience developing and maintaining production-
    grade web applications (ideally with TypeScript, React, or
    similar frameworks).
  - Strong understanding of frontend architecture, component-
    driven development, and modern build pipelines.
  - Possess a good understanding of system design and an ability
    to work with complex systems.
  - Strong product intuition for applying AI to solve real user
    problems and ship features that deliver genuine value.
  
  About Working With Us
  
  Joining Parity means joining team mates who are genuinely
  excited about the impact their projects are having, and the
  opportunity to grow alongside some of the brightest minds in
  the Web3 space! You’ll work remotely and flexibly, while
  still getting to meet your team mates throughout the year at
  team and company-wide retreats.
  
  Upon receiving an offer, all candidates undergo a background
  check through Zinc, our trusted third-party provider. Team
  members will be taken on as a contractor via our UK entity.
