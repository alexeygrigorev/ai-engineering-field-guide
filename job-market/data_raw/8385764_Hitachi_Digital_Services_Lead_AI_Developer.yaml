  Our Company
  
  
  
  We’re Hitachi Digital, a company at the forefront of digital
  transformation and the fastest growing division of Hitachi
  Group. We’re crucial to the company’s strategy and ambition
  to become a premier global player in the massive and fast-
  moving digital transformation market.
  
  
  
  Our group companies, including GlobalLogic, Hitachi Digital
  Services, Hitachi Vantara and more, offer comprehensive
  services that span the entire digital lifecycle, from
  initial idea to full-scale operation and the infrastructure
  to run it on. Hitachi Digital represents One Hitachi,
  integrating domain knowledge and digital capabilities, and
  harnessing the power of the entire portfolio of services,
  technologies, and partnerships, to accelerate synergy
  creation and make real-world impact for our customers and
  society as a whole.
  
  
  
  Imagine the sheer breadth of talent it takes to unleash a
  digital future. We don’t expect you to ‘fit’ every
  requirement – your life experience, character, perspective,
  and passion for achieving great things in the world are
  equally as important to us.
  
  
  
  
  
  The Team
  
  Hitachi Digital is a leader in digital transformation,
  leveraging advanced AI technologies to drive innovation and
  efficiency across our global operating companies (OpCos) and
  corporate functions. We are seeking an experienced Lead AI
  Developer to spearhead new AI initiatives and strengthen our
  Agentic AI capabilities. You will build new AI products and
  refine existing models to meet evolving business needs, with
  a primary focus on GCP and Gemini Enterprise.
  
  
  
  The role
  
  Design, develop, and implement production-grade AI models,
  agents, and algorithms using Agentic AI frameworks
  (multi‑agent orchestration, tool‑use, memory, judge/ranker
  patterns). Lead delivery of Gemini Enterprise solutions
  (including Agent Workspace/Agent Builder or equivalent),
  defining agent roles, toolchains, and safety guardrails for
  enterprise workflows. Drive new AI initiatives across OpCos
  and corporate functions, ensuring secure integration with
  existing systems, data sources, and processes. Enhance and
  scale current Agentic AI capabilities for improved
  performance, latency, reliability, and cost efficiency.
  Implement RAG (retrieval‑augmented generation)
  pipelines—document ingestion, embeddings, vector search,
  grounding, and citations. Collaborate with product,
  engineering, data, and business teams to translate
  requirements into high‑impact AI features and APIs.
  Establish LLMOps/MLOps practices (CI/CD, versioning,
  evaluation harnesses, rollback, prompt/test suites) and AI
  Ops observability (latency, accuracy, cost, drift/bias).
  Troubleshoot complex production issues across models,
  agents, tooling, and integrations; drive root‑cause analysis
  and corrective actions. Produce clear technical
  documentation—architecture decisions, model cards,
  playbooks, and best practices; mentor junior engineers and
  lead code/design reviews. Stay current on the latest
  developments in LLMs/SLMs, embeddings, vector databases,
  safety/guardrails, and evaluation methodologies.
  
  What you’ll bring
  
  Requirements (Must‑Have)
  
  Bachelor’s or master’s in computer science, Artificial
  Intelligence, Machine Learning, or related field. 7+ years
  in AI/ML development, including production delivery of
  LLM‑powered applications. Hands‑on experience with Gemini
  Enterprise in real‑world deployments (prompting, tool‑use,
  safety, evaluation, cost/latency tuning). Deep experience
  with Agentic AI frameworks (multi‑agent design,
  orchestration, tool/plugin ecosystems, agent memory,
  judge/critic patterns). Primary experience on Google Cloud
  Platform (GCP), including Vertex AI (Pipelines,
  Endpoints/Model Serving, Model Registry/Monitoring, Vector
  Search) and secure service integration (IAM, Secret Manager,
  VPC‑SC). Strong programming skills in Python (preferred) and
  one of Java/C++/TypeScript; proficiency building REST/gRPC
  services and event‑driven workflows. Prior, demonstrable
  experience with Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language
  Models (LLMs), including grounding/RAG and evaluation.
  Practical expertise with AI/ML frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow,
  PyTorch) and NLP techniques. Solid understanding of
  MLOps/LLMOps and AI Ops (observability, explainability,
  bias/drift monitoring, rollback strategies). Excellent
  problem‑solving skills and the ability to work independently
  and within cross‑functional teams; strong written and verbal
  communication skills.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  Experience integrating agents with enterprise systems (ERP,
  CRM, ITSM, Finance, Procurement) via APIs and eventing
  (Pub/Sub). Background in vector databases, embeddings, and
  knowledge graphs (e.g., Neo4j) for contextual intelligence.
  Exposure to GPU‑based training/inference, prompt
  optimization, and cost‑aware routing/ensembling of
  LLMs/SLMs. Familiarity with orchestration libraries and
  evaluation tooling (e.g., LangChain/Graph, custom harnesses,
  judge/ranker patterns). Certifications such as Google
  Professional Cloud Architect or Machine Learning Engineer.
  
  What Success Looks Like (First 6–12 Months)
  
  Launch of production Agentic AI features on GCP with
  measurable improvements in user satisfaction and business
  outcomes. Established LLMOps/AI Ops dashboards and SLIs/SLOs
  (quality, latency, cost), with automated testing and safe
  rollback. Documented guardrails and governance artifacts
  (model cards, policy checks, audit logs) meeting enterprise
  compliance standards. Demonstrable reduction in latency/cost
  and uplift in answer quality via prompt tuning, retrieval
  optimization, and agent orchestration.
  
  Core Competencies
  
  Architectural thinking with a product mindset—balancing
  innovation, reliability, and compliance. Operational
  excellence—instrumentation, telemetry, and continuous
  improvement. Collaboration & leadership—clear communication
  across engineering, data, product, and business
  stakeholders. Ownership & bias for action—ability to turn
  ambiguous problems into shipped AI capabilities.
  
  Tools & Tech You’ll Use
  
  Cloud & AI: GCP, Vertex AI (Pipelines, Endpoints, Model
  Registry/Monitoring, Vector Search), Gemini Enterprise.
  Agentic AI: Multi‑agent orchestration, tool‑use frameworks,
  safety/guardrails, memory, judge/ranker patterns. Retrieval:
  Embeddings, vector databases, RAG pipelines with grounding
  and citations. Engineering: Python, Java/C++/TypeScript,
  REST/gRPC, Pub/Sub, CI/CD, containerized services.
