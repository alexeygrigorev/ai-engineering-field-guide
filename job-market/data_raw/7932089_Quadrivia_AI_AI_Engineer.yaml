  About Us
  
  Quadrivia is the health technology company behind Qu, a
  comprehensive, controllable, and customizable assistant AI
  built by clinicians, for clinicians. Addressing the urgent
  shortage of healthcare professionals, Qu provides real-time,
  personal, and reliable support for clinical tasks across the
  care continuum. Designed for providers, payers, and
  pharmaceutical companies, Qu is easy to customize and
  integrates seamlessly into workflows, delivering precise
  assistance across the care spectrum.
  
  The Role
  
  Own and evolve the core “brain” service that powers Qu.
  Design, build, and operate multi-agent LLM systems that
  communicate in real time over text and voice. Ship fast
  Python services with FastAPI, keep latency low, quality
  high, and evaluation continuous.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Own Qu’s brain service end to end: architecture, SLAs,
    latency budgets, error modes, rollouts.
  - Low-latency comms: streaming text and voice, VAD, barge-in,
    turn-taking, interruption handling. WebRTC, SIP, and
    LiveKit experience is a strong plus.
  - Multi-agent orchestration: planner–executor–critic patterns,
    role routing, shared memory, tool routers, coordination
    protocols and evaluation.
  - Reasoning & optimization: ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, plus
    Tree-/Graph-of-Thoughts when useful.
  - Programmatic prompt optimization: DSPy for prompt/program
    compilation; integrate MiPRO and GEPA for iterative prompt
    evolution under eval constraints.
  - RAG engineering: high-signal retrieval (chunking, hybrid
    search, re-ranking), query rewriting, compression,
    caching, freshness, and strong grounding; evaluate
    faithfulness, context precision/recall, and answer
    relevancy.
  - Evaluation & observability: Pre-call validate inputs,
    enforce safety, and verify retrieval quality for RAG; in-
    call trace prompts, tool calls, token/latency/cost and
    enforce streaming guardrails; post-call run automated task
    evals (faithfulness, relevancy, hallucination, safety),
    regressions, red-teaming, and CI/CD gates. Instrument with
    structured logs and OpenTelemetry, surface dashboards and
    alerts, and feed live traffic slices into shadow evals for
    drift detection.
  
  Minimum Qualifications
  
  - 5+ years in ML or backend engineering in product
    environments; recent focus on LLM systems.
  - Expert Python. Strong FastAPI, asyncio, pydantic, and
    production observability.
  - Real-time systems: you’ve built or integrated low-latency
    text/voice. You have used LiveKit, Pipecat or similar
    tech.
  - Working knowledge of agent patterns and eval-driven
    development.
  - Hands-on with ReAct and CoT; pragmatic with ToT/GoT
    tradeoffs.
  - Prior startup experience.
  
  Nice To Have
  
  - DSPy for compilation and self-improving workflows;
    MiPRO/GEPA integration.
  - Experience with evaluation tooling and LLM-as-judge setups.
  - WebRTC/SRTP, jitter buffers, SIP basics; LiveKit a plus.
  - LiveKit Agents, SIP–WebRTC gateways, TURN/SFU tuning.
  - GCP: Cloud Run/GKE, Pub/Sub, Vertex AI, GCS, Secret Manager,
    Cloud Logging/Trace.
  - Healthcare data familiarity.
  
  Example Problems You’ll Tackle
  
  - Push median voice round-trip under 2 seconds while
    preserving turn-taking and barge-in.
  - Set up OTEL-first tracing for the agent graph with automated
    eval triggers on production traffic slices.
  - Improve our RAG pipeline with hybrid retrieval and re-
    ranking, then prove gains via faithfulness and context
    metrics with regression harnesses.
  - Turn EHR integrations into LLM tools.
  
  Tech Stack
  
  Python, FastAPI, pydantic, asyncio, Redis, Postgres, vector
  stores, WebRTC stacks, LiveKit, SIP gateways, STT/TTS,
  Docker, Terraform, K8s, OTEL, DeepEval.
  
  What You Get
  
  - Work on cutting-edge real-time agent tech with a best-in-
    class team in healthtech.
  - Fun off-sites in Barcelona.
  - High-tech laptop and solid dev ergonomics.
  - Flexibility: work from home or hybrid in Barcelona/London.
