  WHAT YOU WILL BE DOING
  
  Lead the design, development, and scalability of core Java-
  based backend services that power our multi-tenant platform.
  
  Architect and optimize platform components to support high-
  throughput, low-latency, and mission-critical workflows.
  
  Integrate and manage core data systems (e.g., relational
  DBs, Redis, Elasticsearch, LDAP) to ensure performance,
  availability, and fault tolerance.
  
  Drive the modernization of backend services, refactoring
  legacy Java components and adopting modern patterns (e.g.,
  reactive programming, event-driven architectures).
  
  Champion best practices for Java development, testing,
  observability, and deployment in a distributed,
  microservices-based environment.
  
  Collaborate cross-functionally with teams across DevOps,
  Security, SRE, and Application Engineering to build robust
  platform capabilities.
  
  Evaluate and implement scalable solutions for
  authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, and
  configuration management.
  
  Mentor engineers across teams in deep Java design
  principles, debugging complex issues, and engineering for
  reliability.
  
  Develop and maintain platform APIs, service orchestration
  logic, and critical workflows that support core business
  operations.
  
  Identify and remediate bottlenecks in Java services, JVM
  performance, GC tuning, thread management, and memory
  footprint.
  
  Build automation and guardrails for developer productivity
  and service reliability (CI/CD pipelines, code linting,
  config-as-code, etc.).
  
  Partner with architecture and leadership to drive long-term
  technical strategy and platform evolution.
  
  WHAT YOU BRING
  
  10+ years of experience in Software Engineering with a
  strong focus on Java, Spring Boot, and distributed system
  design.
  
  Proven track record of building and maintaining scalable
  backend platforms supporting millions of users or high
  concurrency.
  
  Deep understanding of the Java ecosystem, JVM internals,
  memory management, performance tuning, and multithreading.
  
  Hands-on experience with data systems such as
  PostgreSQL/MySQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, and LDAP.
  
  Experience designing and supporting multi-tenant
  architectures, including isolation, resource control, and
  config management.
  
  Strong experience in building and managing RESTful APIs,
  microservices, and platform-level abstractions.
  
  Familiarity with infrastructure and deployment environments
  including Kubernetes, Docker, and AWS (or other cloud
  providers).
  
  Solid knowledge of observability tools (e.g., Prometheus,
  Grafana, OpenTelemetry) and log management (e.g., ELK
  stack).
  
  Experience integrating authentication and identity providers
  (LDAP, SSO, OIDC) into Java services.
  
  Strong command of DevOps and automation practices (CI/CD,
  GitOps, IaC tools like Terraform, Helm, or Ansible).
  
  Proven leadership in cross-team collaboration, mentoring,
  and influencing architectural direction.
  
  Excellent analytical, problem-solving, and communication
  skills.
