  Backend Engineer - AI Platform
  
  Job Location: Bangalore, India
  
  Experience : 3 - 5 years
  
  About Unifize:
  
  At Unifize, we’re building the AI-native product suite for
  regulated manufacturing companies. Our platform is designed
  to unify Quality, Operations, and R&D in a single
  collaborative system.
  
  Today, life sciences and other regulated manufacturers rely
  on a patchwork of disconnected tools, eg, QMS, DMS, PLM,
  MES, spreadsheets, and email, to manage their processes.
  This fragmentation slows down innovation, increases
  compliance risks, and forces teams to waste time manually
  connecting the dots.
  
  Unifize changes that by bringing process, documentation, and
  communication together in one place. Whether it's managing
  CAPAs, resolving deviations, launching new products, or
  preparing for audits, Unifize enables teams to work faster
  with full traceability and audit readiness built in.
  
  What makes Unifize different:
  
  - No-code configuration for rapid deployment and adaptation
  - Collaboration embedded in every record, not siloed in email
    or chat
  - Context-aware AI that suggests actions, detects risks, and
    enhances productivity
  - Flexible architecture that supports expansion across QMS,
    DMS, MES, PLM, CMMS, and more
  
  We’re already working with leading companies in the life
  sciences and manufacturing sectors. Our customers start with
  one use case and consistently expand, with 100% net
  expansion to date.

  The Role:
  
  We're building a new AI Platform microservice that
  integrates tightly with our core Clojure-based system. This
  role involves leading backend development for this service,
  primarily in Python, working on AI/ML integrations and
  microservices architecture, and ensuring robust data
  handling via PostgreSQL.
  
  We don’t expect prior experience with Clojure but value
  curiosity and a willingness to learn. This role is a good
  fit for engineers who enjoy ownership, functional
  programming principles, and building infrastructure that
  powers intelligent applications.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Own and build Python-based backend services that interface
    with AI models and core product workflows
  - Design and manage scalable PostgreSQL and vector database
    schemas and queries
  - Develop and maintain RESTful APIs
  - Collaborate with the platform and frontend teams to ensure
    clean integration with the larger Unifize system
  - Contribute to design decisions, including service
    boundaries, API structure, and data pipelines
  - Write clean, well-tested code and proactively review others'
    work
  
  Qualifications:
  
  - Strong proficiency in Python, with emphasis on clean,
    modular design
  - Solid understanding of relational databases, particularly
    PostgreSQL
  - Experience designing and consuming LLM APIs and writing
    integrations with them – having understanding of RAG,
    vectorisation
  - Familiarity with architectural principles behind modern web
    applications
  - Ability to work in a fast-paced environment with a
    collaborative, product-focused team
  
  Good to have:
  
  - Understanding of AI/ML model integrations and workflows in
    production environments
  - Experience with functional or functional-style programming
    (e.g., Clojure, Elixir, Scala, Java 8+)
  - Exposure to distributed systems and microservices
  - Familiarity with message queues, job orchestration, or
    asynchronous processing
industries:
  - Software
  - Manufacturing
