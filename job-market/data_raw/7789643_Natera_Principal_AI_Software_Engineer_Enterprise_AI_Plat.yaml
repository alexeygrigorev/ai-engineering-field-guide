  Role Overview
  
  The Enterprise AI Platform Engineer is responsible for build
  and delivery of Natera’s enterprise agentic AI platform. The
  enterprise AI platform will be used to prototype and build
  multiple agentic AI solutions using low code across Natera
  in a federated approach.This is a hands-on technical
  leadership role at the intersection of engineering
  excellence, low code platform design, and applied GenAI
  engineering.
  
  You will architect and build the core AI operating system
  that powers modular, low-code  enterprise AI agentic
  automation that is complete with agent templates, agent
  orchestration engine, data and MCP connectors, prompt
  optimization capabilities, evaluation guardrails, abstracted
  AI services, intelligent data extraction and reasoning
  capabilities. The platform empowers citizen developers,
  business analysts, and engineers to prototype and test AI-
  powered workflows using a low-code interface, while enabling
  developers to extend functionality through a pro-code
  framework.
  
  Key Responsibilities Platform Architecture & Core
  Infrastructure
  
  - Design: Design and implement the core architecture of the
    Enterprise AI Platform — low code, modular, scalable, and
    secure.
  - Agentic Orchestration: Build the agent orchestration
    runtime, including task queues, state management, and
    inter-agent communication.
  - Complexity: Architect for long-running, resilient AI
    workflows, enabling agents to execute and monitor multi-
    step, asynchronous processes.
  - Low code abstraction: Develop APIs and services for
    automation, evaluation, and agent lifecycle management.
  - Deployment: Establish DevOps, CI/CD pipelines, and
    configuration management to ensure smooth deployment at
    scale.
  
  Low-Code/Pro-Code Experience
  
  - Low-Code Interface: Build an intuitive visual builder that
    allows business users to compose agent workflows through
    drag-and-drop and configuration.
  - Pro-Code Mode: Provide a developer extension layer where
    engineers can author and deploy agents in code (Python,
    TypeScript) directly into the same framework.
  - Unified Runtime: Ensure both low-code and pro-code workflows
    share common infrastructure for orchestration, evaluation,
    and governance.
  - Transparency & Debugging: Surface workflow traces, model
    evaluations, and output explanations directly in the user
    interface.
  - Experimentation & Versioning: Support iterative
    experimentation, evaluation-based comparison, and rollback
    through integrated version control.
  
  Agentic Orchestration & Long-Running Agents
  
  - Orchestration Engine: Build a robust orchestration system
    supporting both short-lived agent calls and long-running
    AI agents that persist over time to automate complex
    processes.
  - Workflow Automation: Enable orchestration of multiple agents
    with shared state, scheduling, dependency resolution, and
    event-driven execution.
  - Enterprise Integration: Connect agents to core enterprise
    systems to perform real-world actions securely.
  - Autonomy & Resilience: Implement mechanisms for persistence,
    checkpointing, recovery, and human-in-the-loop
    interventions.
  - Human in the Loop Feedback: Design human-in-the-loop and
    self-assessment mechanisms for continuous prompt and
    workflow improvement.
  - Evaluation as a Core Layer: Architect an evaluation-first
    framework for monitoring and improving AI agent
    performance across all workflows.
  
  AI Services & Capabilities
  
  - MCP Integration: Integrate with Model Context Protocols
    (MCPs) to enable plug-and-play connectivity with external
    systems and actions.
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Build services to
    retrieve information from unstructured data using vector
    databases and retrieval pipelines.
  - Prompt Optimization & Evaluation: Implement automated
    systems for prompt tuning, evaluation, and feedback loops
    to ensure reliable results.
  - Abstracted AI Services: Build modular APIs for AI services
    such as unstructured document processing, information
    retrieval, information summarization, data extraction,
    content generation, classification etc.
  - Evaluation as a Core Layer: Architect an evaluation-first
    framework for monitoring and improving AI agent
    performance across all workflows.
  - Reusable Components: Create shared, composable AI primitives
    (e.g., document loaders, semantic routers, extractors) to
    accelerate workflow design.
  
  Governance, Security & Observability
  
  - Enforce governance, security, and compliance principles
    (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR) across all platform operations.
  - Implement RBAC, audit logging, and lineage tracking for all
    data and agent interactions.
  - Build observability tools for tracing, cost monitoring, and
    system performance metrics.
  - Integrate evaluation-based guardrails that detect
    hallucinations, bias, or policy violations in real time.
  - Metric Tracking: Create structured metrics dashboards
    (precision, recall, task success rate, cost efficiency)
    for every deployed agent.
  
  Technical Leadership & Collaboration
  
  - Establish technical standards, documentation, and
    engineering patterns for future platform development.
  - Collaborate with business stakeholders, data scientists, and
    product teams to identify automation use cases and measure
    ROI via evaluation metrics.
  - Mentor future engineers and contribute to an engineering
    culture centered on safety, transparency, and impact.
  - Continuously explore emerging agent frameworks, vector
    stores, and evaluation methodologies.
  
  Qualifications
  
  Required
  
  - 12+ years of software engineering experience, with 8+ years
    in platform or distributed systems architecture.
  - Proven expertise in implementing workflow orchestration or
    automation systems
  - Proficiency in Python with deep experience in backend
    architecture and API design.
  - Experience with low-code/no-code automation platforms
    (Zapier, n8n etc.), internal developer platforms (IDPs),
    or workflow engines (Temporal, Airflow).
  - Experience in working with well known agentic cloud
    platforms (e.g. AWS Bedrock agents, AgentCore etc.).
  - Hands-on experience with LLMs, RAG, vector databases, and
    orchestration frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGen,
    DSPy).
  - Fluency in cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, Docker, and
    CI/CD automation.
  - Knowledge of observability and telemetry systems for event-
    driven environments.
  - Familiarity with AI governance and evaluation frameworks,
    LLM safety, drift detection, bias detection,
    hallucination, explainability, and compliance (e.g.,
    HIPAA, CLIA, FDA).

  - Advanced degree (MS/PhD) in Computer Science, AI/ML,
    engineering or related field.
  - Experience in healthcare, pharma, diagnostics, or other
