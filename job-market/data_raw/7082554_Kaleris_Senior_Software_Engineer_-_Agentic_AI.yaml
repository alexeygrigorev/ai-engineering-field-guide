  Job Description:
  
  About the Role
  
  Kaleris is looking for a Senior Software Engineer with deep
  expertise in agentic AI systems, LLM orchestration, and
  production-scale deployment. You will shape and deliver
  strategic GenAI features, mentor team members, and drive
  applied AI projects utilizing frameworks like LangGraph.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Architect and lead development of advanced agentic AI
    systems using LangGraph or similar frameworks.
  - Own the full model lifecycle: research, solution design,
    prototyping, optimization, testing, and production
    deployment.
  - Lead and mentor the AI team, setting best practices for
    model quality, scalability, and responsible AI.
  - Integrate LLMs with enterprise data, orchestration systems,
    and workflow automation (RAG, vector search, API
    development).
  - Collaborate with engineering, product, and business
    stakeholders to define AI-driven product features and
    roadmaps.
  - Conduct technical reviews, establish coding standards, and
    ensure codebase robustness.
  - Optimize AI infrastructure for performance, cost, and
    reliability (cloud, MLOps, container orchestration).
  - Champion innovation: stay ahead of industry trends, bring
    actionable insights and drive adoption of new AI
    technologies.
  - Ensure AI model governance, fairness, and compliance with
    ethical/organizational standards.
  
  Requirements
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s (PhD a plus) in Computer Science,
    Engineering, or related field.
  - 5+ years building and deploying AI/ML systems (at least 2+
    years with LLMs or agentic frameworks in production).
    Proven track record building agentic patterns (ReAct,
    Agentic Loops), multi-agent systems, and graph-based
    orchestration engines.
  - Proven experience with Python, LLM technologies, advanced
    prompt engineering, and agent workflows (LangGraph,
    LangChain, CrewAI), async programming (asyncio), and
    backend frameworks (FastAPI, Django).
  - Deep understanding of cloud AI platforms (AWS/Azure),
    containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), and CI/CD for ML
    ops.
  - Demonstrated leadership in AI solution design, code and
    architecture reviews, and mentoring junior engineers.
  - Experience with retrieval pipelines, vector databases, and
    cloud-native architectures.
  - Proficient with full-stack AI development: APIs,
    microservices, data pipelines.
  - Strong knowledge of MLOps tools, monitoring, versioning, and
    responsible AI.
  - Excellent communication, influencing, and cross-team
    collaboration skills.
  - Intellectual curiosity, a drive for innovation, and a
    passion for making an impact with AI.
  
  Highly Desired
  
  - Experience building enterprise agentic AI or autonomous
    workflow orchestration systems.
  - Expertise with neural search, advanced RAG, and enterprise
    data integration.
  - Certifications in AI/ML, cloud, or relevant technologies.
  - Logistics/supply chain software experience is a strong plus.
