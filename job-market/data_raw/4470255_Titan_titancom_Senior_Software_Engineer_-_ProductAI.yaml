  About Titan
  
  Titan is an award-winning wealth manager with a mission to
  increase our generation’s compound growth rate. We plan to
  do this by putting a human wealth advisor in every pocket.
  Historically, wealth managers have been accessible to only
  the ultra-wealthy. With Titan, they’re available to
  everyone. We harness frontier technologies like artificial
  intelligence to build a platform that gives advisors
  superpowers, enabling them to serve clients they
  historically never could. Backed by a16z, General Catalyst,
  Sam Altman, and many others, we manage over $1 billion in
  assets for clients across the country.
  
  Why Join Titan
  
  For the right person, we believe Titan will be one of the
  most rewarding jobs they ever have.
  
  - Ambitious Vision: When we put private wealth management in
    every pocket, we’ll make a legacy-defining impact in
    growing our generation’s wealth to new heights.
  - Critical Why Now: The advent of LLMs unlocks our vision to
    democratize personalized wealth management for everyone.
    This drives our urgency every day.
  - Disproportionate Impact: We’re still at the beginning of our
    journey with a small team, which means your impact at
    Titan will disproportionately matter.
  - Vibrant In-Person Culture: We thrive on being a high-touch
    team, working together in the trenches in person (you’ll
    see our founders in office every day).
  - Compensation: Titan offers competitive cash compensation and
    well-above-market equity packages because we want every
    team member to be an owner.
  - World-Class Investors: We’re backed by top investors who
    share our bold vision, including a16z, General Catalyst, Y
    Combinator, and Sam Altman.
