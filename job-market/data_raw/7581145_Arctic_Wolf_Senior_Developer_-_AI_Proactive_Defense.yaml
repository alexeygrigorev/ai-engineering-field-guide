  At Arctic Wolf, we're redefining the cybersecurity
  landscape. With our employee Pack members, spread out
  globally, committed to setting new industry standards. Our
  accomplishments speak for themselves, from our recognition
  in the Forbes Cloud 100, CNBC Disruptor 50, Fortune Future
  50, and Fortune Cyber 60 to winning the 2024 CRN Products of
  the Year award. We’re proud to be named a Leader in the IDC
  MarketScape for Worldwide Managed Detection and Response
  Services and earning a Customers' Choice distinction from
  Gartner Peer Insights. Our Aurora Platform also received
  CRN’s Products of the Year award in the inaugural Security
  Operations Platform category. Join a company that’s not only
  leading, but also shaping, the future of security
  operations.
  
  Our mission is to end cyber risk. This is a unique
  opportunity to lead a high-impact, highly technical team in
  a fast-growing company recognized on the Deloitte Fast 500,
  with a track record of doubling in size, revenue, and
  customer base year over year.
  
  About the Role
  
  We are looking for a Senior Developer to help build the next
  generation of agentic AI frameworks that power Arctic Wolf's
  AI Proactive Defense platform.
  
  In this role, you will contribute to the development of
  intelligent agents capable of autonomous reasoning,
  decision-making, and proactive threat mitigation.
  
  You will work on multi-agent orchestration systems, LLM
  integration, and AI-driven automation pipelines that form
  the backbone of our AI-powered Security Operations Centre
  (SOC).
  
  Some of your Key responsibilities will be:
  
  • Contribute to the design and development of agentic AI
  frameworks for proactive threat detection and response.
  
  • Implement multi-agent coordination logic for planning,
  execution, and self-correction in dynamic security
  workflows.
  
  • Integrate LLMs, vector databases, and tool-use APIs to
  enable contextual memory and autonomous reasoning.
  
  • Build modular orchestration components for knowledge
  routing, task delegation, and agent collaboration.
  
  • Collaborate with cross-functional teams to ensure
  production-grade scalability, observability, and resilience.
  
  • Prototype and evaluate emerging agentic AI tools (e.g.,
  LangChain, Semantic Kernel, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, CrewAI).
  
  • Participate in code reviews, design discussions, and
  contribute to technical documentation.
  
  We value a culture of sharing, so every team has the
  opportunity to share their work with the entire department
  during our regular R&D Demos. Once a year we hold a
  department-wide Hackathon, teaming up across all R&D teams
  over four days to collaborate and build cool ideas outside
  the normal project scope. While innovation is the focus,
  some of these ideas do make it into our products.
  
  Nice to Have
  
  • Exposure to cybersecurity, threat detection, or SOC
  operations.
  
  • Experience with vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Pinecone)
  and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
  
  • Familiarity with ML Ops tools and practices (e.g., MLflow,
  Kubeflow).
  
  • Contributions to open-source AI or automation projects.
  
  About You
  
  • 5+ years of experience in backend software development,
  distributed systems, or applied AI engineering.
  
  • Solid experience with Python, Go, or similar backend
  programming languages.
  
  • Familiarity with LLMs and agentic AI frameworks such as
  LangChain, Semantic Kernel, or OpenAI/Anthropic APIs.
  
  • Understanding of cloud-native architectures and
  microservices (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
  
  • Passion for building intelligent systems that can reason,
  learn, and act autonomously.
  
  • Strong problem-solving skills and a collaborative mindset.
  
  • Experience working in agile, cross-functional teams.
  
  You have a history of delivering successful projects, as
  well as some lessons learned from failures. Even if you
  haven’t worked with all our specific technologies, you bring
  a diverse knowledge base that you use to help the team solve
  complex technical problems. You’ll receive all the security
  training you need during our onboarding process and through
  additional training on the job.
