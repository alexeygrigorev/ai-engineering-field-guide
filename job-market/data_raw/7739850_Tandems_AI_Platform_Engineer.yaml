  AI Platform Engineer
  
  Location:  Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India
  
  Come thrive at Tandems! We build intelligent solutions that
  reimagine how advice is delivered, how institutions operate,
  and how expertise is unlocked at scale. Our AI-enabled
  platform empowers advisors, bankers, and agents with deeper
  insights, personalized recommendations, and more time to
  focus on guiding clients through life’s most important
  decisions. We are pioneering Finance With Intelligence,
  where technology amplifies human impact instead of replacing
  it.
  
  Through partnerships with some of the world’s largest and
  most innovative financial institutions like Wells Fargo,
  Citizens Bank and ScotiaBank, we seek to help our clients
  make better financial decisions.
  
  About the Team and Opportunity
  
  The Engineering Team designs, builds, and maintains the
  systems that power Tandems’ AI-enabled platform, which
  reimagines how financial advice is delivered, how
  institutions operate, and how advisors help clients succeed.
  We build:
  
  - Client-facing applications that enable seamless onboarding,
    personalized advice, and digital collaboration.
  
  - Algorithms and investment systems that support smarter
    portfolio management and better financial outcomes.
  
  - AI-powered tools that give advisors intelligent insights,
    streamline workflows, and enhance client engagement across
    our products: TandemsInvest, TandemsMeet, and TandemsGrow.
  
  As an AI Platform Engineer, you’ll design and develop the
  foundational capabilities that make our AI-powered products
  possible — from retrieval and orchestration layers to model
  integration and evaluation frameworks. You’ll work across
  the stack to turn LLM capabilities into production-ready,
  compliant, and reliable features that directly impact how
  advisors engage with their clients.

  - As a reliable and trusted financial solutions provider with
    expanding reach to 1 in 3 households nationwide, we
    believe it takes extraordinary people to disrupt decades
    of legacy financial practices to reimagine solutions that
    serve customers at scale.

    Recognition Programs, and more!
  - We are a remote-first company! We have regional hubs
    nationwide,  with presence in 4 Countries:  United States,
    Canada, India, and Singapore.
  - We believe that one size fits one and embrace a culture that
    honors and celebrates diversity of backgrounds, approaches
    and experiences.
  - We are guided by our core values: Customer Delight, Make It
    Happen, Think Big, and We Over Me. Read more about our
    core values and how we live them every day on our website
    here.
  
  How You’ll Make an Impact
  
  - Design and build the core AI platform services that power
    advisor-facing features such as intelligent insights,
    meeting summaries, and next-step recommendations.
  - Develop and maintain retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
    and semantic search pipelines that allow our models to
    access and reason over financial data securely and
    efficiently.
  - Integrate foundation models (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock,
    Azure OpenAI, or open-source alternatives) into scalable
    microservices and APIs.
  - Create and manage prompt orchestration and versioning
    frameworks to support consistent and reliable AI responses
    across products.
  - Develop evaluation, monitoring, and observability systems to
    ensure AI quality, compliance, and performance in
    production.
  - Optimize inference performance, latency, and cost through
    model routing, caching, and fine-tuning strategies.
  - Collaborate closely with product teams to enable new AI
    capabilities and ensure that AI outputs align with
    financial domain standards and regulations.
  - Stay current with LLM and agentic technology advancements
    and help shape how Tandems applies them to real-world
    advisor workflows.
