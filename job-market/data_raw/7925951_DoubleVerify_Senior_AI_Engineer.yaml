  Who we are
  
  
  
  DoubleVerify is the leading independent provider of
  marketing measurement software, data, and analytics that
  authenticates the quality and effectiveness of digital media
  for the world's largest brands and media platforms. DV
  provides media transparency and accountability to deliver

  more at www.doubleverify.com.
  
  
  
  The Opportunity
  
  
  
  We're building the infrastructure backbone for the next
  generation of AI-powered advertising verification that
  processes billions of impressions daily from the world's
  largest social media platforms. As a Senior DevOps Engineer
  on our US Hub team in NYC, you'll be at the intersection of
  platform engineering and artificial intelligence, pioneering
  what doesn't exist yet. This isn't a traditional DevOps
  role—we need someone who thinks like a software engineer
  first and brings that mindset to infrastructure. You'll own
  critical platforms, architect novel solutions for AI agent
  deployment (LangChain, ADK), and work across multiple
  engineering teams to define standards that impact hundreds
  of developers. If you want to build the future rather than
  just maintain the present, this is your opportunity.
  
  
  
  What You'll Achieve
  
  
  
  Pioneer AI Infrastructure
  
  - Design and build the foundational infrastructure for
    deploying AI agents at scale, working with emerging
    technologies like LangChain and Agent Development Kit to
    create capabilities that don't yet exist in the market
  - Partner directly with AI/ML teams to enable rapid deployment
    of agentic solutions, turning research into production
    systems
  
  Own Critical Platforms
  
  - Architect, deploy, and operate our Kubernetes platform
    across cloud (GCP/AWS) and data center environments,
    ensuring 99.9%+ uptime for systems processing billions of
    daily transactions
  - Build the tooling and automation that makes complex systems
    simple for 100+ developers
  
  Elevate Engineering Excellence
  
  - Create operators, microservices, and management tools that
    shape how engineers across DV interact with infrastructure
  - Drive CI/CD evolution, building self-service capabilities
    that empower teams while maintaining security and
    reliability
  
  Shape Technical Standards
  
  - Influence product design from the ground up, ensuring new
    features integrate seamlessly with DV's infrastructure
  - Work across multidisciplinary DevOps teams to establish
    patterns that scale across the organization
  
  What You'll Bring
  
  Required:
  
  - 5+ years in DevOps/Platform Engineering roles with
    significant software development (we need engineers who
    write code, not just YAML)
  - 3+ years owning and operating production Kubernetes
    platforms (cloud or on-prem)
  - Strong programming skills in at least one of: Python, Go, or
    TypeScript - you should be comfortable building
    microservices and automation tooling
  - Cloud platform expertise in GCP or AWS (multi-cloud
    experience is a plus)
  - Observability mindset - you naturally think about metrics,
    logging, tracing, and use data to drive decisions
  - Builder mentality - you're energized by creating systems
    that encourage automation, observability, and ease of
    maintenance
  
  Nice to Have:
  
  - Experience developing AI workloads using frameworks like
    LangChain, CrewAI, or Google Agent Development Kit
  - Background in site reliability engineering (SRE) practices
  - Contributions to open-source DevOps tooling
  - Experience with Terraform, ArgoCD, or infrastructure-as-code
    at scale
  
  Beyond the Resume:
  
  - You're a strong collaborator who can translate technical
    concepts for non-technical stakeholders and work
    effectively across teams
  - You have genuine curiosity about improving developer
    experience—you ask "how can we make this easier?" not
    "that's not my job"
  - You bring initiative and autonomy—when you see a problem,
    you propose solutions
  
  Our Tech Stack
  
  - Cloud: GCP (primary), AWS, Oracle Cloud (emerging)
  - Orchestration: Kubernetes (GKE, Rancher), ArgoCD, Helm
  - AI/ML: LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, Google ADK, n8n
  - Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog
  - CI/CD: GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions
  - IaC: Terraform, Ansible
  - Languages: Python, Go, Bash, TypeScript
  
  Why TechOps at DoubleVerify?
  
  Real Innovation: We're not just keeping the lights on—you'll
  work on bleeding-edge AI infrastructure that doesn't have a
  playbook yet. Your work directly influences how Fortune 500
  companies verify billions of dollars in digital media spend.
  
  
  
  Autonomy & Ownership: Senior engineers own entire platforms
  and make architectural decisions. We trust you to define
  solutions, not just implement tickets.
  
  
  
  Collaborative Culture: You'll work with a global team across
  US, Israel, and Europe, learning from diverse perspectives
  while mentoring others.
  
  
  
  Growth Path: Clear progression to Staff/Principal Engineer
  or Engineering Management, with opportunities to shape
  technical direction and speak at industry conferences.
  
  
  
  Modern Work Environment:
  
  - Hybrid flexibility (3 days in NYC office, flexible
    scheduling)
  - Strong remote collaboration tools and practices
  - Learning budget for certifications, conferences, and courses
  - Access to cutting-edge AI tools (Cursor, GitHub Copilot,
    etc.)
  
  The successful candidate’s starting salary will be
  determined based on a number of non-discriminating factors,
  including qualifications for the role, level, skills,
  experience, location, and balancing internal equity relative
  to peers at DV. The estimated salary range for this role,
  based on the qualifications set forth in the job
  description, is between $73,500- $213,000. This role will
  also be eligible for bonus/commission (as applicable),
  equity, and benefits. The range above is for the
  expectations as laid out in the job description; however, we
  are often open to a wide variety of profiles, and recognize
  that the person we hire may be more or less experienced than
  this job description as posted.
  
  
  
  Not-so-fun fact: Research shows that while men apply to jobs
  when they meet an average of 60% of job criteria, women and
  other marginalized groups tend to only apply when they check
  every box. So if you think you have what it takes but you’re
  not sure that you check every box, apply anyway!
