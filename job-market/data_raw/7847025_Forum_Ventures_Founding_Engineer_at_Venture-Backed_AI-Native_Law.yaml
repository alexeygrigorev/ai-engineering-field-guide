  About Us
  
  Shepherd is the hybrid law firm for startups, combining AI-
  powered technology with experienced attorney oversight to
  deliver faster, more affordable, and transparent legal
  services. Built for early-stage companies from pre-seed
  through Series B, Shepherd provides fixed-cost pricing and
  glass-box transparency- eliminating the unpredictability of
  traditional billable hours. The firm's contextual AI learns
  each client's business, risk appetite, and deal preferences,
  enabling personalized legal solutions at a fraction of
  BigLaw costs. Unlike pure technology platforms, Shepherd
  clients work directly with dedicated attorneys who provide
  strategic guidance and relationship-driven counsel. Shepherd
  is building the future of legal services- where efficiency
  increases client value, not just law firm margins.
  
  The Opportunity
  
  We’re looking for a Founding Engineer / Head of Engineering
  to own the technical vision and build the core product from
  the ground up. This is a true founding team–level role:
  you’ll architect the AI engine, shape the product’s data and
  workflow systems, and lead the technical execution that
  powers the first AI-native law firm for startups.
  
  As Founding Engineer / Head of Engineering, you’ll partner
  closely with the CEO and CLO to turn complex legal workflows
  into scalable, automated systems- blending LLMs, structured
  data, and human-in-the-loop validation into a seamless,
  modern startup experience.
  
  This is a 0→1 product build, a leadership role, and an
  opportunity to define the technical foundations of a
  category-defining company.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  Technical Leadership
  
  - Architect the end-to-end technology stack for the Shepherd
    platform (LLM infrastructure, workflow engine, database
    design, API integrations (Slack, Docusign, ect).
  - Establish engineering best practices, technical roadmap, and
    long-term architecture decisions.
  - Build the foundation for a secure, compliant system that
    meets startup and enterprise legal standards.
  - Own the evaluation, fine-tuning, and deployment of LLMs for
    contract analysis, summarization, redlining, and risk
    scoring.
  
  Product & AI Development
  
  - Build our core features:
    - AI contract review and redlines
    - Build and expand a context-aware AI
    - Smart drafting and document automation
    - Workflow automation (intake, tasking, approvals)
    - Legal hub for requests, docs, alerts, and lawyer interaction
  - Design human-in-the-loop systems that blend AI speed with
    attorney validation.
  - Translate ambiguous legal workflows into clean, reliable,
    repeatable technical systems.
  - Work directly with early customers to validate and iterate
    on features in real time.
  
  Security, Compliance & Infrastructure
  
  - Set up infrastructure that meets SOC-2 and privacy
    standards.
  - Implement secure document storage, access controls, role-
    based permissions, and audit trails.
  - Ensure ethical, compliant, and trustworthy use of AI models
    across the platform.
  
  Team & Culture
  
  - Hire and lead a world-class engineering team as we scale
    (frontend, backend, ML/AI).
  - Build a culture of velocity, quality, and ownership.
  - Act as a technical co-founder who can communicate clearly
    with investors, partners, and customers.
  
  Who You Are
  
  - 6–12+ years of experience as a full-stack engineer or
    technical founder (AI/ML or workflow-heavy SaaS strongly
    preferred).
  - Deep experience building production AI systems (LLM fine-
    tuning, embeddings, RAG, evaluation).
  - Strong product instincts with a bias toward shipping quickly
    and iterating.
  - Experience designing secure, scalable architectures for B2B
    or workflow products.
  - Comfortable in ambiguity: able to turn undefined problems
    into structured, elegant solutions.
  - Entrepreneurial DNA- you want to build, own, and scale
    something from the ground up.
  - Bonus: experience with legal tech, fintech, compliance
    systems, or other highly regulated verticals.

    generational company redefining legal infrastructure.

    firm + SaaS platform for startups.
