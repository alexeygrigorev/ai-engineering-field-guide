    environments
  - Develop monitoring, logging, and alerting systems enhanced
    by AI for predictive insights
  - Collaborate with aerospace, flight software, and test
    engineers to ensure seamless integration between software,
    hardware, and operations
  - Write efficient, maintainable, and well-documented
    infrastructure code (Python, Bash, IaC)
  - Conduct system reviews and implement best practices for
    secure and reliable operations
  - Stay up-to-date with emerging AI/ML and DevOps technologies,
    applying them to improve speed, safety, and scalability

  - Experience with AIOps, anomaly detection, or ML-based
    testing frameworks
  - Familiarity with infrastructure-as-code tools (Terraform,
    CloudFormation)
  - Knowledge of secure DevOps / DevSecOps practices,
    particularly in regulated industries
  - Exposure to aerospace or defense systems and simulation
    environments
  - Strong problem-solving skills and ability to work in fast-
    paced, high-iteration environments
