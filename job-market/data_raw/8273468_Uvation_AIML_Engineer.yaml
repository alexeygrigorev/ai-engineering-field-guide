  Job Title: AI/ML Engineer Department: IT Services Reports
  To: IT Project Manager
  
  Job Overview:
  
  The AI/ML Engineer plays a critical role in designing,
  developing, and deploying machine learning models and AI-
  driven solutions to support strategic business initiatives.
  The role involves collaborating with cross-functional teams,
  including software engineering, data analytics, product
  development, and business stakeholders, to drive intelligent
  automation, data-driven decision-making, and advanced
  analytics capabilities.
  
  The ideal candidate will have 3 to 5 years of experience in
  AI/ML model development, with a strong foundation in machine
  learning algorithms, data preprocessing, and deployment
  pipelines. Experience with Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and
  cloud-based ML services is essential.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  1. Model Development and Optimization
  
  - Design, build, and deploy ML models for classification,
    regression, NLP, computer vision, or time-series
    forecasting.
  - Select appropriate algorithms and techniques based on
    business needs and data characteristics.
  - Continuously monitor and improve model performance using
    metrics and feedback loops.
  
  2. Data Preparation and Feature Engineering
  
  - Clean, preprocess, and transform structured and unstructured
    datasets for training and inference.
  - Engineer and select relevant features to improve model
    accuracy and generalizability.
  - Collaborate with data engineers to ensure data quality and
    accessibility.
  
  3. Model Deployment and MLOps
  
  - Package and deploy models using tools like Docker,
    Flask/FastAPI, and Kubernetes.
  - Implement CI/CD pipelines for ML using platforms like
    MLflow, Airflow, or Kubeflow.
  - Monitor deployed models for drift, latency, and performance
    in production environments.
  
  4. AI Solutions and Use Case Implementation
  
  - Work with business stakeholders to translate real-world
    problems into AI/ML use cases.
  - Prototype and test AI-driven solutions (e.g., recommendation
    engines, chatbots, fraud detection).
  - Contribute to proof-of-concept projects and assist in
    scaling successful models to production.
  
  5. Research and Innovation
  
  - Stay updated with the latest research, frameworks, and tools
    in machine learning and AI.
  - Experiment with cutting-edge models (e.g., LLMs,
    transformers, generative AI) and assess their viability.
  - Promote innovation by recommending and implementing modern
    AI strategies.
  
  6. Cross-functional Collaboration
  
  - Collaborate with software developers, DevOps, data analysts,
    and domain experts for end-to-end solution delivery.
  - Translate technical insights into business value through
    clear documentation and presentations.
  
  7. Documentation and Best Practices
  
  - Maintain comprehensive documentation for models,
    experiments, and pipelines.
  - Ensure reproducibility, scalability, and compliance with
    data governance policies.
  
  Requirements:
  
  Experience:
  
  - 3–5 years of hands-on experience in machine learning model
    development and deployment.
  - Proven track record of solving real-world problems using
    supervised, unsupervised, or deep learning methods.
  
  Technical Skills:
  
  Strong knowledge of:
  
  - Python and ML libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy,
    TensorFlow/PyTorch)
  - Model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and pipeline
    automation
  - REST APIs for model serving and integration
  
  Familiarity with:
  
  - MLOps tools (MLflow, Airflow, DVC, Docker, Kubernetes)
  - Cloud ML services (AWS SageMaker, Azure ML, GCP AI Platform)
  - NLP or computer vision frameworks (e.g., Hugging Face,
    OpenCV)
  
  Soft Skills:
  
  - Strong analytical and problem-solving abilities.
  - Excellent communication skills, both verbal and written.
  - Ability to work independently and within cross-functional
    teams.
  - Curiosity, adaptability, and willingness to learn
    continuously.
industries:
  - Information Technology
  - Consulting
