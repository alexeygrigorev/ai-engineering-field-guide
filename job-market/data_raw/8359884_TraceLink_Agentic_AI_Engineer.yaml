  Agentic AI Engineer (0–2 Years Experience)Location: Pune,
  India
  
  About the Role
  
  We are looking for an early-career Agentic AI Engineer to
  help build and evolve AI-powered systems that automate and
  improve supply chain workflows. In this role, you’ll work
  alongside experienced engineers and data scientists to
  develop agentic AI / GenAI features, integrate knowledge-
  based retrieval (RAG) patterns, and contribute to testing
  and validation approaches for AI systems that can behave in
  non-deterministic ways.
  
  This is a strong opportunity for someone who is eager to
  grow in both software engineering and applied GenAI, and
  wants to work on real-world enterprise problems in supply
  chain and (optionally) life sciences.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Support the design and implementation of agentic AI / GenAI
    systems that assist in automating supply chain workflows.
  - Build and maintain backend services and integrations using
    Python and/or Java.
  - Contribute to multi-agent workflows, such as tool execution,
    routing, agent collaboration patterns, and task
    orchestration.
  - Assist in creating testing and validation strategies for AI
    systems, including evaluation datasets, regression
    testing, and behavior monitoring.
  - Help implement and improve knowledge base systems, including
    RAG pipelines, grounding strategies, and retrieval quality
    improvements.
  - Contribute to experimentation with:
    - lightweight fine-tuning approaches for small language models
      (SLMs)
    - reinforcement-learning-inspired improvement loops for
      NLP/GenAI tasks (where applicable)
  - Partner with product and domain teams to understand supply
    chain needs and translate them into working software.
  - Participate in code reviews, documentation, and operational
    support to ensure high-quality production systems.
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  - Master’s degree in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence,
    Machine Learning, Computer Science, or a closely related
    discipline.
  - 0–2 years of professional experience in software
    engineering, AI engineering, or ML engineering
    (internships and co-ops count).
  - Strong programming skills in Python and/or Java, including
    writing production-quality code.
  - Familiarity with cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Azure
    (academic, personal, or internship experience is
    acceptable).
  - Interest or exposure to Generative AI concepts, such as
    LLMs, agent workflows, tool calling, or multi-step
    reasoning.
  - Understanding of core engineering fundamentals:
    - APIs and services
    - basic distributed systems concepts
    - debugging and performance basics
    - data structures & algorithms
  - Ability to learn quickly, take feedback well, and
    collaborate effectively in a team environment.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Coursework, projects, or hands-on experience with agentic or
    multi-step AI systems, including non-deterministic
    behavior patterns.
  - Exposure to designing knowledge base solutions, such as:
    - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    - embedding-based search
    - hybrid search approaches
    - reranking or relevance evaluation
  - Experience or academic background in one of the following:
    - fine-tuning small language models (SLMs)
    - training or adapting NLP models
    - Reinforcementreinforcement learning concepts applied to
      language systems
  - Exposure to event-driven or reactive systems
  - Interest in supply chain domains (logistics, manufacturing,
    procurement, etc.).
  - Knowledge of the life sciences supply chain is a plus, but
    not required.
  
  What Success Looks Like
  
  - You can take a defined task (e.g., building a new RAG
    retriever, improving evaluation coverage, or implementing
    a new agent tool) and deliver a working solution with
    support from senior engineers.
  - You write clean, testable code and steadily improve your
    ability to debug real-world production issues.
  - You contribute to AI system reliability through experiments,
    evaluation improvements, and thoughtful engineering.
  
  Who You Are
  
  - Curious, motivated, and excited to build AI-driven products
    that ship to real users.
  - Comfortable working with a mix of predictable engineering
    tasks and emerging AI workflows.
  - Strong team player with a growth mindset and a willingness
    to learn.
