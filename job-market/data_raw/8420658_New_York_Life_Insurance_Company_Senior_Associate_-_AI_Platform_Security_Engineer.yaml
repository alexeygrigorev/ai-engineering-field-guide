description: |
  Location Designation: Hybrid - 3 days per week  The Security
  Engineer will play a key role in designing, engineering, and
  securing NYL's AI development platform built on Google Cloud
  and Vertex AI. This is a hands-on security engineering role
  focused on establishing secure-by-design foundations for AI
  and ML workloads, including data ingestion, model
  development, training pipelines, and deployment. The
  engineer will work closely with cloud platform, data
  science, and ML engineering teams to implement security
  controls that protect sensitive data while enabling rapid
  experimentation and delivery. This role requires deep
  expertise in cloud security, identity, network controls, and
  automation, combined with a practical understanding of AI/ML
  development patterns in regulated environments. What You'll
  Do:
  
  - Engineer, configure, and maintain security controls for
    Google Cloud and Vertex AI environments.
  - Design and implement secure Vertex AI architectures covering
    notebooks, pipelines, model registry, endpoints, and
    feature stores.
  - Define and enforce IAM patterns for human and non-human
    identities, including service accounts and Workload
    Identity Federation.
  - Implement network security controls such as VPC design,
    private connectivity, service perimeters, and egress
    restrictions for AI workloads.
  - Engineer encryption strategies for AI data and artifacts,
    including CMEK, data-at-rest, and data-in-transit
    protections.
  - Establish security guardrails and baseline configurations
    for AI development teams using infrastructure-as-code.
  - Integrate audit logging, monitoring, and alerting for Vertex
    AI and GCP security events.
  - Implement DLP controls to prevent sensitive data exposure
    during training and inference workflows.
  - Conduct threat modeling and security assessments for AI and
    ML use cases.
  - Partner with data science, ML engineering, and cloud
    platform teams to embed security into development
    workflows without impeding velocity.
  
  What You'll Bring:
  
  - Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Information Systems,
    or equivalent experience.
  - 5+ years of experience in cloud security or security
    engineering roles.
  - Hands-on experience securing Google Cloud Platform
    environments.
  - Direct experience with Vertex AI or comparable ML platforms,
    including securing end-to-end ML workflows.
  - Strong knowledge of cloud IAM, least-privilege design, and
    non-human identity management.
  - Experience implementing network security controls in cloud
    environments (VPCs, private endpoints, service
    perimeters).
  - Familiarity with AI/ML security risks such as data
    poisoning, model theft, inference abuse, and data leakage.
  - Proficiency with Python for security automation and policy
    enforcement.
  - Experience with infrastructure-as-code (Terraform
    preferred).
  - Understanding of regulatory and compliance requirements in
    financial services environments.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Google Professional Cloud Security Engineer certification.
  - Experience securing AI/ML platforms in highly regulated
    industries.
  - Familiarity with AI security frameworks such as MITRE ATLAS.
  - Experience with CI/CD integration for ML pipelines and
    security guardrails.
  - Knowledge of confidential computing and secure data
    processing techniques.
  - Exposure to generative AI security concerns (LLMs, RAG,
    agents).
