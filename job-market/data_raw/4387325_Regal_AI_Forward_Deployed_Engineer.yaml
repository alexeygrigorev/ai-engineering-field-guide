  ABOUT THE ROLE:
  
  As an AI Forward Deployed Engineer at Regal you’re the
  product owner of each customer’s onboarding journey. Imagine
  taking the reins of a micro “product launch” for every new
  customer. You’ll be responsible for bringing our Voice AI
  Agents to life in production.
  
  This role is for someone who doesn’t know the meaning of
  “not my problem.” You take end-to-end ownership, step into
  ambiguity, and do what it takes to move customers forward.
  It’s a unique opportunity to work with founders at the
  forefront of AI innovation and define the next generation of
  customer experiences.
  
  If you love operating at the intersection of technical
  execution and product strategy—turning business objectives
  into real product experiences and approaching each
  deployment like a tightly scoped MVP—this role was built for
  you.
  
  RESPONSIBILITIES:
  
  - Accelerate Customer Deployments: Execute end-to-end
    deployments by treating onboarding as a mini product
    cycle, integrating AI Agents seamlessly into customer
    systems and workflows to move the needle on key business
    metrics.
  - Own the Product Vision (Per Deployment): Collaborate with
    customers to understand their goals, success criteria, and
    operational context. Then, translate these insights into a
    clear, measurable deployment plan that aligns Regal’s
    capabilities with their strategic objectives.
  - Architect Technical Integrations: Work hands-on with APIs,
    webhooks, and databases to seamlessly integrate Regal into
    the customer’s existing systems.
  - Shape Conversational Experiences: Work internally with Regal
    AI Product Specialists to guide the creation and
    refinement of voice prompts and AI agent settings to
    achieve the conversational quality that is Regal’s
    signature.
  - Measure, iterate, and adapt: Build reporting to measure AI
    Agent performance, partner with customers to refine post-
    call analysis, and create a roadmap of A/B tests to
    continuously improve accuracy and outcomes.
  - Stakeholder Management: Provide weekly status updates,
    manage timelines, and communicate proactively with both
    internal and external stakeholders. Mitigate risks,
    reprioritize as needed, and keep everyone aligned around
    the deployment roadmap.
  - Unlock Future Value: As customers gain confidence, surface
    new use cases and features that can drive ongoing value.
    Use your product and commercial mindset to spot expansion
    opportunities and ensure each deployment isn’t just a one-
    off success, but the start of a long-term partnership.
  
  ABOUT YOU:
  
  - Technical Chops: 3+ years in a technical customer-facing
    role (e.g., Solutions Engineer, Implementation Consultant
    or a PM in a tech environment). Comfort working with APIs,
    writing a bit of middleware code when needed, and framing
    product capabilities for executive stakeholders.
  - Strategic Problem-Solving: You look beyond the immediate
    ask, synthesizing business needs, user experience, and
    platform constraints into a cohesive product vision—and
    executing on it.
  - Outstanding Communication: Whether you’re writing a project
    brief, presenting call flow diagrams, or explaining data
    integration steps to a CTO, you tailor your message and
    ensure everyone understands the big picture.
  - Relentless Ownership: “Not my problem” isn’t in your
    vocabulary. You’re accountable for the success of each
    deployment, making smart trade-offs, iterating quickly,
    and doing whatever it takes to ship on time.
  - Curiosity for AI & Voice: You’re excited about the potential
    of Voice AI. Maybe you’ve dabbled in conversational
    design, prompt engineering, or user research for voice
    interfaces. You’re eager to learn more and push the
    envelope on what’s possible.
  - Entrepreneurial DNA: You thrive in fast-paced, ambiguous
    environments where you can shape processes, influence
    product direction, and drive revenue. Your adaptability
    and growth mindset help you navigate change and complexity
    with ease.
  - Ability to travel: You should expect to travel 1 week per
    month. When launching a new customer, you’ll travel to
    their office (if they are in person), and periodically
    thereafter to meet with execs.
