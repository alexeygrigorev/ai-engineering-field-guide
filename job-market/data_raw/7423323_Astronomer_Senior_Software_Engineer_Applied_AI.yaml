  About this role
  
  Apache Airflow is one of the most popular open-source data
  platform tools. It powers the data platforms at nearly every
  large company and fast-growing startups: Airbnb, Uber,
  OpenAI, Anthropic, Nike, Capital One, Disney all use Airflow
  extensively. At Astronomer, we’re the largest contributors
  to the project and are building commercial products around
  Airflow to make it easier to use, run, and scale.
  
  We’re in a unique position: as the company behind Apache
  Airflow, we see data as it moves across entire
  organizations—from raw ingestion to production dashboards,
  machine learning models, and AI products. Leveraging this
  vantage point, our R&D team is developing a global context
  layer for data—an intelligence layer that powers search and
  discovery, code generation for data and analytics, and
  automated root cause analysis. LLMs are already quite good
  at writing Python and SQL code against data platforms; we
  think this context layer will give them the metadata
  necessary for data practitioners everywhere to use LLMs
  effectively.
  
  As a Software Engineer on this team, you’ll help design and
  build this foundation and the applications around it. You’ll
  work on some of the hardest and most exciting challenges in
  data—search, information retrieval, and AI for data
  pracitioners—while collaborating with a small, highly
  skilled team that values velocity, creativity, and impact.
  This role sits at the intersection of applied research,
  software engineering, and product: we think it takes someone
  who can work across the stack to build, release, and scale
  products successfully in this space.
  
  What you get to do:
  
  - Shape the future of AI for data engineering - build
    intelligent systems that understand, reason about, and
    optimize the flow of data across entire organizations.
  - Design and engineer the brain of Astronomer’s context layer,
    crafting components that power data modeling, semantic
    search, retrieval, and code generation.
  - Push the boundaries of applied AI - experiment with LLMs,
    embeddings, and cutting-edge retrieval techniques to
    create developer tools that deliver insights to you and
    our customers.
  - Turn research into reality - work side by side with R&D and
    product teams to bring early AI concepts to life in the
    product experience.
  - Solve high-impact information retrieval and search
    challenges at a global scale, leveraging Astronomer’s
    unparalleled visibility into data pipelines across
    industries.
  - Influence the technical vision and architecture for the next
    generation of AI-driven data products.
  - Represent Astronomer in the community - through open-source
    contributions, technical talks, and publications that
    showcase our leadership in AI and data innovation.
  
  What you bring to the role:
  
  - Empathy for users, and a deep interest in improving the
    workflows of data professionals.
  - Familiarity with early-stage product development;
    comfortable working with ambiguity in a fast-changing
    field.
  - Experience with LLMs, vector databases, embeddings, or other
    applied AI areas—or a strong desire to dive in.
  - A creative, experimental mindset: you enjoy exploring
    uncharted areas, validating hypotheses, and learning
    through iteration.
  - Strong collaboration and communication skills—you can
    explain complex systems clearly to both technical and non-
    technical audiences.
  - A collaborative approach and comfort working in an evolving,
    research-driven environment where ideas move quickly.
  
  Bonus points if you have:
  
  - A passion for AI systems for data, developer tools, or
    machine learning infrastructure.
  - Familiarity with Apache Airflow or other orchestration
    tools.
  - Demonstrated contributions to open source projects.
  - Experience in search, IR, or large-scale data
    infrastructure.
  - Exposure to early-stage startups or R&D organizations where
    ambiguity is the norm.
  
  The estimated salary for this role ranges from $180,000 -
  $210,000 based on leveling and geography, along with an
  equity component and a comprehensive benefits package. This
  range is merely an estimate; actual compensation may deviate
  from this range based on skills, experience, and
  qualifications.
