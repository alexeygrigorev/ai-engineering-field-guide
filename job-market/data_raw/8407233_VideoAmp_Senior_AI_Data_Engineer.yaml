description: |
  VideoAmp is on a mission to create the best employee and
  workplace experience where people can bring their whole self
  to work everyday.  We believe that accomplishing something
  great requires a special group of people who work hard,
  drive results and have a blast while doing it - people who
  challenge the status quo and embody our values.  People who
  say “I’ll find a way” instead of saying “it can’t be done.”
  At VideoAmp, we believe in challenging advertising paradigms
  to maximize value for clients. We do this by enabling
  companies to execute on business outcomes across their media
  investment instead of more traditional media metrics.
  VideoAmp is the software and data solutions company powering
  the convergence of linear TV and digital video advertising.
  Our solutions connect linear TV viewership with addressable
  data assets to benefit the marketing and media industries.
  This enables marketers and content owners to holistically
  plan, transact, and measure deduplicated audiences across
  digital video, OTT, connected and linear TV advertising.
  Role & Responsibilities
  
  VideoAmp is seeking a Senior AI Data Engineer  to join our
  Linear Data Processing (LDP) team. This role focuses on
  building production-grade AI and LLM-powered systems
  directly into large-scale data pipelines that support
  audience measurement, currency, identity, and metadata
  workflows across linear and digital media.
  
  You will apply LLMs and classical ML to real-world linear TV
  problems: network-specific schedules, hourly viewership
  logs, program metadata, and commercial schedules that vary
  widely by partner, format, and quality.
  
  - Design and operate AI- and LLM-enabled data pipelines
    processing billions of linear and digital records
  - Build and productionize LLM-driven systems for concrete LDP
    problems, including:Network & Program Schedules
  - Hourly Viewership Logs
  - Commercial & Ad Spot Metadata
  - Combine LLMs with rules, heuristics, and ML models to ensure
    deterministic, auditable outcomes
  - Own the end-to-end AI lifecycle, including:
  - Integrate LLMs responsibly into batch and event-driven LDP
    workflows, balancing accuracy, latency, and cost
  - Build human-in-the-loop workflows for high-impact or low-
    confidence cases
  - Collaborate closely with Measurement, Identity, Library, and
    Product teams to translate ambiguous data issues into
    scalable AI solutions
  - Provide technical leadership through design reviews,
    mentorship, and architectural guidance
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - 4+ years of experience in AI/ML engineering, applied ML
    systems, or data engineering
  - Demonstrated experience shipping LLM-powered systems into
    production
  - Strong understanding of:
  - Proficiency in Python and SQL; strong software engineering
    fundamentals
  - Experience working with large-scale data platforms and
    distributed systems
  - Ability to design AI systems that meet measurement-grade
    reliability, explainability, and auditability requirements
  
  Strong Plus
  
  - Experience working with TV schedules, viewership logs, or
    advertising metadata
  - Familiarity with linear TV measurement or media data
    pipelines
  - Experience applying AI in compliance-sensitive or customer-
    facing measurement systems
  - Knowledge of MLOps / LLMOps best practices
  
  What Success Looks Like at VideoAmp
  
  - LLM-powered systems materially reduce manual curation of
    schedules and metadata
  - Data quality issues are detected earlier and explained more
    clearly
  - Measurement pipelines become more adaptive to partner-
    specific formats
  - AI systems are trusted, observable, and operationally stable
  
  What We Offer
  
  This position pays between $150,000 - $170,000 + Equity +
  Benefits. The actual compensation offer will be determined
  by a number of factors, including, but not limited to,
  applicant's qualifications, skills, and experience.
  
  - Discretionary and flexible paid time off
  - In addition to standard US holidays off, VideoAmp employees
    also partake in Spring, Summer and Winter breaks
  - Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision benefits for you
    and your dependents—including multiple options fully
    covered by VideoAmp
  - Unlimited financial wellness sessions with Origin financial
    advisors
  - 401k Plan with matching
  - HSA & FSA
  - Commuter Benefits
  - Cell Phone Reimbursement
  - Paid Maternity and Parental Leave for All Family Additions
  
  We are on a collective mission to bring equity and
  transparency into media measurement, and that begins with an
  honest, inclusive culture. At VideoAmp, we empower our team
  to thrive through collaboration, mentorship, and innovation.
  If you’re passionate about technical revenue accounting,
  SaaS transformation, and AdTech innovation, we’d love to
  hear from you.
  
  Above all, if you’re eager to influence and support the
  revolutionary goals of a dynamic, cross-functional team—join
  us and make an impact!
