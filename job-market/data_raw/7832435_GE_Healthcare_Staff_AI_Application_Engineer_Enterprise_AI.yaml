  Core Responsibilities
  
  - Design and develop AI-powered applications, integrating
    machine learning and generative models into enterprise-
    grade software products and internal tools. Own the full
    software development lifecycle (SDLC), including unit,
    integration, and end-to-end testing.
  - Frontend: Develop modern, intuitive interfaces for AI
    applications (React/Next.js, TypeScript, or equivalent)
    with a strong focus on usability, accessibility, and AI
    explainability.
  - Backend: Implement scalable and secure back-end services
    (FastAPI, Flask, or Node.js) to expose AI capabilities
    (LLMs, RAG pipelines, AI agents) through standardized
    APIs.
  - Translate data science prototypes and GenAI models (LLMs,
    diffusion models, transformers) into scalable applications
    or services with intuitive user interfaces and reliable
    back-end infrastructure.
  - Collaborate with insight leaders and business stakeholders
    on requirements gathering, project documentation, and
    development planning.
  - Partners with MLOps and GenAIOps teams to deploy, monitor,

  - Design and implement integrations using REST, GraphQL, and
    gRPC; work with cloud-based AI APIs (Azure, AWS, GCP) and
    enterprise data sources.
  - Integrate cloud-native AI services (AWS Bedrock, Azure
    OpenAI) and open-source frameworks (LangChain, LangGraph)
    into enterprise environments.
  - Monitor application performance and user adoption, iterating
    on models and workflows to enhance usability and business
    impact.
  - Optimize application performance, infrastructure efficiency,
    and LLM utilization.
  - Document architectures, APIs, and deployment processes to
    ensure transparency, reusability, and maintainability.

  - Proven track record implementing end-to-end AI systems,
    integrating ML/LLM models into scalable microservices or
    enterprise applications.
  - Strong experience in ML/GenAI frameworks (TensorFlow,
    PyTorch, LangChain, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel) and cloud-
    native AI platforms (AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI).
  - Working knowledge of cloud environments (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
    and containerization tools (Docker).
  - Deep experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD
    automation for AI workloads.
  - Demonstrated experience with RAG pipelines, vector
