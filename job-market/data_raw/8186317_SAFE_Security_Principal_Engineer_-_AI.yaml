  At SAFE Security, our mission is bold and ambitious: We Will
  Build CyberAGI — a super-specialized system of intelligence
  that autonomously predicts, detects, and remediates threats.
  This isn’t just a vision—it’s the future we’re building
  every day, with the best minds in AI, cybersecurity, and
  risk. At SAFE, we empower individuals and teams with the
  freedom and responsibility to align their goals, ensuring we
  all move towards this goal together.
  
  We operate with radical transparency, autonomy, and
  accountability—there’s no room for brilliant jerks. We
  embrace a culture-first approach, offering an unlimited
  vacation policy, a high-trust work environment, and a
  commitment to continuous learning. For us, Culture is Our
  Strategy—check out our Culture Memo to dive deeper into what
  makes SAFE unique.
  
  As a Principal Engineer - AI, you will define and lead the
  technical direction of AI systems that power Safe’s CRQ,
  CTEM, and TPRM products, including agentic workflows, RAG
  pipelines, LLM orchestration, and AI-native developer
  tooling. You’ll be the hands-on architect behind Safe’s AI
  engineering stack, bridging model intelligence with
  production-grade infrastructure.
  
  You’ll collaborate with product, data, and platform teams to
  design scalable, explainable, and enterprise-ready systems.
  
  This is a high-impact, technical leadership role that will
  shape how AI is built, deployed, and governed across Safe.
  
  Core Responsibilities:
  
  - Architect Safe’s AI Systems: Design and scale AI-driven
    components — LLM orchestration, retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG), vector stores, prompt pipelines, and AI
    microservices. Drive architecture for AI observability,
    safety, and evaluation (precision, recall, F1,
    hallucination detection, cost metrics).
  - Productionize AI Agents: Build multi-turn, goal-oriented
    agent systems that automate reasoning across TPRM, CTEM,
    and CRQ domains (e.g., control reviews, issue RCA,
    automated responses). Ensure reliability, traceability,
    and deterministic behavior in production.
  - AI Infrastructure & Platform Ownership: Partner with
    Platform & DevOps teams to operationalize model serving
    (AWS SageMaker, Bedrock, or self-hosted Llama), build AI
    APIs, and manage model lifecycle and versioning. Establish
    feature stores, embedding management, and in-memory
    retrieval layers.
  - Data Pipeline & Knowledge Graph Integration: Work with Data
    Engineering to design pipelines for structured and
    unstructured data ingestion, semantic indexing, and
    context retrieval (Snowflake + Iceberg + LlamaIndex).
  - AI Evaluation, Monitoring & Governance: Define internal
    frameworks for golden dataset validation, LLM evaluation
    (LangFuse/LangSmith), and safety enforcement policies.
    Implement human-in-the-loop (HITL) mechanisms and
    continuous feedback loops.
  - Mentor & Multiply: Guide AI and backend engineers on
    architectural design, experimentation methodologies, and
    prompt optimization. Collaborate with product leaders to
    translate abstract AI goals into measurable engineering
    deliverables.
  
  Minimum Qualifications:
  
  - Experience: 12+ years total experience in software
    engineering, including 4+ years building AI/ML systems or
    large-scale data/LLM infrastructure.
  - Core Technical Skills:
  - MLOps & Infra: Familiar with model versioning, CI/CD for ML,
    and performance optimization for real-time inference.
  - Applied AI Focus: Practical understanding of evaluation
    metrics, hallucination detection, RAG reliability, and
    enterprise AI safety.
  
  Preferred Qualifications:
  
  - Experience integrating AI into cybersecurity or risk
    management products
  - Familiarity with multi-agent systems and autonomous
    workflows (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen)
  - Experience building AI evaluation dashboards and AI
    observability stacks
  - Knowledge of knowledge graphs, semantic search, or retrieval
    pipelines
  - Exposure to data governance, compliance, or SOC2/ISO 27001
    environments
  - Published research, open-source contributions, or prior
    leadership of AI teams is a strong plus
  
  If you’re passionate about cyber risk, thrive in a fast-
  paced environment, and want to be part of a team that’s
  redefining security—we want to hear from you! 🚀
