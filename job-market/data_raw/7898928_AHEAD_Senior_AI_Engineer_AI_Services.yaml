  AHEAD builds platforms for digital business. By weaving
  together advances in cloud infrastructure, automation and
  analytics, and software delivery, we help enterprises
  deliver on the promise of digital transformation.

  where all perspectives and voices are represented, valued,
  respected, and heard. We create spaces to empower everyone
  to speak up, make change, and drive the culture at AHEAD.
  
  We are an equal opportunity employer, and do not

  We embrace all candidates that will contribute to the
  diversification and enrichment of ideas and perspectives at
  AHEAD.
  
  Role Overview
  
  The Senior AI Engineer is a hands-on builder responsible for
  designing, developing, and deploying agentic AI solutions
  for AHEAD’s clients. This role blends software engineering,
  multi-agent orchestration, and applied AI to deliver real
  business outcomes across workflows like document
  intelligence, coding automation, service desk, operations,
  and decision support.
  
  You will design agents, build pipelines, integrate models
  with enterprise systems, and operate production-grade
  agentic automations. You will collaborate directly with
  clients, solution managers, and other engineers to turn
  ambiguous ideas into scalable, resilient solutions. This
  role is central to AHEAD’s strategy of delivering
  enterprise-grade agentic AI.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Solution Development & Deployment
  - Build and deploy multi-agent systems using frameworks such
    as LangChain, LangGraph, Autogen, CrewAI, and LlamaIndex.
  - Develop custom agents for document processing, workflow
    automation, SDLC acceleration, data analysis, and business
    process orchestration.
  - Integrate LLMs, SLMs, embeddings, and retrieval pipelines
    (Pinecone, Elasticsearch, Snowflake Cortex, pgvector)
  - Create and operate LLM/ML endpoints, agent memory/state
    stores, and event-driven triggers.
  - Implement reusable components that become part of AHEAD’s
    agent library and client solution accelerators
  - Enterprise Integration & Workflow Automation
  - Build real-time and batch workflows using Python, Kafka,
    EventBridge, Airflow, Snowflake, S3, n8n, AWS Batch, and
    similar tools.
  - Connect agents to enterprise systems (SharePoint,
    Salesforce, ServiceNow, Jira, Oracle, databases, APIs).
  - Implement RAG, tool-calling, function calling, and
    structured output pipelines for production-ready agentic
    tasks.
  - Ensure robust data transformations, validation, and
    versioning for downstream agent workflows.
  - Quality, Observability & Reliability
  - Implement monitoring, metrics, and guardrails for multi-
    agent systems (timeouts, retries, constraints, circuit
    breakers).
  - Build automated testing for agent behaviors, prompts,
    ETL/batch jobs, and model outputs.
  - Participate in incident reviews, debugging multi-agent
    flows, and ensuring predictable performance.
  - Client Collaboration & Delivery Excellence
  - Work closely with client stakeholders to understand use
    cases, pain points, and success criteria.
  - Translate business needs into technical agent designs and
    execution roadmaps.
  - Participate in agile ceremonies, demos, and working sessions
    with client teams.
  - Contribute to proposals, SOWs, architecture diagrams, and
    client documentation when needed.
  - Security, Governance & Compliance
  - Apply enterprise standards for data security, access
    control, auditing, model governance, and safe AI usage.
  - Embed monitoring, lineage, PII handling, and policy
    constraints into agentic flows.
  - Mentorship & Internal Development
  - Coach junior engineers on agent design patterns, RAG,
    orchestration, and clean engineering practices.
  - Contribute to internal best practices, reference
    architectures, and reusable components.
  - Support onboarding of new engineers and help scale AHEAD's
    agentic engineering community.
  
  Qualifications
  
  - Required
  - Strong Python engineering background, including async
    patterns, APIs, and event-driven design.
  - Hands-on experience with multi-agent frameworks (LangGraph,
    Autogen, CrewAI, LangChain, etc.).
  - Demonstrated ability to build production ETL, orchestration,
    or workflow automation pipelines (Kafka, EventBridge,
    Airflow, Celery, n8n, AWS services).
  - Experience with vector DBs and retrieval pipelines
    (Pinecone, pgvector, Elasticsearch, LlamaIndex).
  - Familiarity with MLOps, observability, CI/CD,
    containerization, and model deployment patterns.
  - Strong documentation habits and comfort working in fast-
    paced agile environments.
  - Experience integrating with enterprise systems or APIs in
    production.
  - Preferred
  - Experience with Snowflake Cortex, Databricks Mosaic, NVIDIA
    NIMs, or similar AI platform components.
  - Experience operating agentic systems at scale, including
    safety constraints and system-level debugging.
  - Experience in consulting, client-facing engineering, or co-
    development models.
  - Success Metrics & Environment
  - Delivery of reliable, scalable agentic solutions that
    measurably improve client outcomes.
  - High client satisfaction, repeat demand, and strong cross-
    functional collaboration.
  - Consistent contribution to reusable accelerators and
    internal knowledge base.
  - Predictable delivery cadence with strong engineering quality
    and observability.
  - Visible growth of AHEAD's reputation for agentic AI
    expertise.
