  Job Summary
  
  We are looking for a motivated AI Software Developer ready
  to take us to the next level! If you thrive in environments
  where "AI" means building robust, maintainable systems (not
  just notebooks), and you’ve shipped AI features in
  production using AWS/Azure and are looking for your next
  career move, apply now.
  
  Job Description
  
  We are looking for an AI Software Developer to design,
  build, and maintain cloud-native backend services,
  infrastructure, and APIs that power AI features. This
  position will be full-time and hybrid.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Software Engineering & Cloud Infrastructure (Primary Focus)
    Design, build, and optimize cloud-native backend services
    (Python/Node.js) for AI applications on AWS or Azure
    (e.g., serverless, containers, managed services).
  - Develop infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform,
    CloudFormation, or ARM templates to automate cloud
    deployments.
  - Implement CI/CD pipelines for AI model deployment,
    application updates, and automated testing (e.g., GitHub
    Actions, Azure DevOps).
  - Build scalable APIs/microservices (FastAPI, gRPC) to serve
    AI features (e.g., LLM inference, agent workflows) with
    security, latency, and cost efficiency.
  - Ensure reliability and observability via monitoring
    (Prometheus, CloudWatch), logging, and alerting for AI
    systems.
  - AI Integration & Productionization (Secondary Focus)
    Integrate generative AI and agentic systems (e.g.,
    LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen) into full-stack
    applications—not just prototyping, but productionizing
    workflows.
  - Design RAG pipelines with vector databases (e.g., Azure
    Cognitive Search, AWS OpenSearch) and optimize for
    latency/cost.
  - Fine-tune LLMs (using LoRA, PEFT) or leverage cloud AI
    services (e.g., AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI) for custom use
    cases.
  - Build data pipelines for AI training/inference (ingestion,
    preprocessing, synthetic data) with cloud tools (e.g., AWS
    Glue, Azure Data Factory).
  - Collaborate with ML engineers to deploy models via
    TorchServe, Triton, or cloud-managed services (e.g.,
    SageMaker Endpoints, Azure ML Endpoints).
  - Collaboration & Ownership Work cross-functionally with
    product, frontend, and data teams to translate business
    needs into scalable AI solutions.
  - Champion software best practices: testing
    (unit/integration), code reviews, documentation, and
    modular design.
  - Mentor junior engineers on cloud engineering and AI system
    design.
  
  What You'll Need
  
  Required:
  
  - 3–4 years of professional software development experience
    with strong fundamentals:
  - Proficiency in Python (required) and modern frameworks
    (FastAPI, Flask, Django).
  - Experience building cloud-native backend systems (AWS or
    Azure) with services like:
  - Compute (EC2, Lambda, Azure Functions, VMs) Storage (S3,
    Blob Storage)
  - Databases (RDS, Cosmos DB, DynamoDB) API gateways (API
    Gateway, Azure API Management)
  - Hands-on experience with containerization (Docker) and
    orchestration (Kubernetes).
  - Proven track record in CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-
    code (Terraform/CloudFormation), and monitoring tools.
  - 1–2 years of hands-on experience in AI application
    development, specifically:
  - Building generative AI or agentic workflows (e.g., using
    LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen).
  - Implementing RAG pipelines or fine-tuning LLMs in production
    (e.g., via AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, or open-source
    models).
  - Experience with cloud AI services (SageMaker, Azure ML) or
    deploying open-source models on cloud infrastructure.
  - Strong software engineering discipline:
  - Writing testable, maintainable code with unit/integration
    tests.
  - Experience with Git workflows, agile development, and
    collaborative code reviews.
  - Understanding of system design (scalability, security, cost
    optimization).
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s in Computer Science, Software
    Engineering, or related field.
  
  Preferred:
  
  - Experience with full-stack development (frontend frameworks
    like React/Vue for AI-powered UIs).
  - Knowledge of serverless architectures (AWS Lambda/Azure
    Functions) for AI workloads.
  - Familiarity with MLOps tools (MLflow, Kubeflow) or cloud-
    native MLOps (SageMaker Pipelines, Azure ML Pipelines).
  - Prior work on cost-optimized AI systems (e.g., model
    quantization, autoscaling, spot instances).
  - Contributions to open-source AI/ML projects or cloud
    infrastructure tooling.
  
  Physical Demands
  
  - Ability to safely and successfully perform the essential job
    functions
  - Sedentary work that involves sitting or remaining stationary
    most of the time with occasional need to move around the
    office to attend meetings, etc.
  - Ability to conduct repetitive tasks on a computer, utilizing
    a mouse, keyboard, and monitor
