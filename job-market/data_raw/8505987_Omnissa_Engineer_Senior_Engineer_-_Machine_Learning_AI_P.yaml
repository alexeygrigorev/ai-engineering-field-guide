  Job Description:
  
  We are Omnissa. The world is evolving quickly, and
  organizations everywhere—from global enterprises to
  educational institutions—are under pressure to deliver
  flexible, work-from-anywhere experiences. They need secure,
  scalable, seamless digital work environments that empower
  employees and customers to access applications from any
  device, on any cloud. That’s where Omnissa comes in.
  
  The Omnissa Platform is the first AI driven digital work
  platform designed to deliver smart, seamless, and secure
  work experiences from anywhere. We uniquely integrate
  industry leading solutions in Unified Endpoint Management,
  Virtual Apps and Desktops, Digital Employee Experience, and
  Security & Compliance—all unified through shared data,
  identity, administration, and automation services. Built on
  the vision of autonomous workspaces—self configuring, self-
  healing, and self-securing—Omnissa continuously adapts to
  how people work, optimizing user experience, IT efficiency,
  security posture, and cost.
  
  As a global private company with over 4,000 employees, we’re
  growing rapidly. If you're passionate about building AI
  systems that operate at a massive scale and shape the future
  of work, we’d love to meet you.
  
  What is the opportunity?
  
  Our platform manages millions of devices across multiple
  operating systems, requiring exceptional performance,
  scalability, availability, and resilience. You will join the
  AI Platform Team, the group responsible for building
  foundational AI capabilities across the Omnissa product
  ecosystem.
  
  As a Machine Learning Engineer, you will design, build, and
  deploy machine learning systems that power predictive
  analytics, personalization, automation, and intelligent
  platform behaviours. You’ll work closely with engineering
  and product teams to operationalize models across our cloud
  scale environment while driving best in class ML engineering
  practices.
  
  You will own engineering initiatives end to end and help
  foster a culture of high ownership, continuous improvement,
  and engineering excellence.
  
  
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Design, develop, and deploy machine learning models for
