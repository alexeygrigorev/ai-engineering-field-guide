description: |
  At Modo Energy, we're building the global standard for
  benchmarking and valuing the world's electrification assets
  - unlocking returns for battery energy storage, solar, wind
  and data centres.
  
  At Modo Energy, we're on a mission to build the information
  architecture for the energy transition - we want to be the
  only place to come to for information on the global journey
  to net zero. Take a look at our platform, where we provide
  open access to an array of content on the energy transition.
  
  We're a dedicated and passionate team building a category-
  defining business, working on one of the world's most
  important priorities. We are looking for individuals who
  love product-building, want to work with pace at a mission-
  oriented startup, and will collaborate with us in shaping
  the culture of a rapidly growing team.
  
  The role
  
  We are hiring a Backend Engineer to join our AI Analyst
  team. The AI Analyst is an LLM-powered product embedded in
  the Modo Terminal that helps customers interrogate our data
  and research using natural language. Think of it as a domain
  expert colleague who knows everything Modo has ever
  published and can pull live data on demand.
  
  We’re building an agentic system that retrieves articles,
  queries databases, interprets energy market data, and writes
  answers that our customers can trust.
  
  You’ll work in a small cross-functional team with a lot of
  autonomy.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Building and improving our agentic backend: LangChain-based
    orchestration, tool design, retrieval pipelines, and
    prompt engineering, running on FastAPI.
  - Designing tools (MCPs, CLIs, APIs, etc) that let LLMs work
    with energy market data effectively: strict guardrails,
    sensible aggregation, and outputs that fit within token
    budgets.
  - Building monitoring and evaluation infrastructure.
  - Working directly with domain experts (energy analysts, data
    scientists) to ensure the system gives answers that are
    accurate and useful.
  - AWS infrastructure and deployment. We use Terraform and
    you’ll be involved in the full lifecycle from local
    development to production.
  
  About you
  
  - 5+ years Python. Strong backend engineering fundamentals:
    you write clean, well-structured Python and you’re
    comfortable owning services end-to-end from API design
    through to deployment and monitoring.
  - Real experience with AWS and infrastructure-as-code
    (Terraform). You’ve deployed and maintained production
    services.
  - Hands-on experience building LLM-powered applications,
    ideally with LangChain, but any serious work with agentic
    systems, RAG pipelines, or tool-calling architectures
    counts.
  - Proficiency with FastAPI or similar async Python frameworks.
  - Expert-level use of AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code,
    GitHub Copilot, or similar). Obsessive about keeping up to
    speed with AI coding developments. We write a lot of code
    with these tools and expect you to be fluent with them:
    knowing when to trust them, when to intervene, and how to
    get the most out of them.
  - Good taste and judgment. This matters more than it might
    sound. You’ll be making constant decisions about how to
    structure LLM interactions, what data to surface, and when
    something is good enough to ship. We want someone who
    cares about the end result.
  - Comfort working in a small, fast-moving team where you’ll be
    expected to figure things out, make tradeoffs, and ship.
  
  Nice to have:
  
  - Experience with energy markets.
  
  Important Details
  
  - Hybrid Work Environment: This role is hybrid, with time
    split between working from home and our London office,
    with in-office days from Tuesday through Thursday.
  - Compensation & Benefits: Modo Energy offers a competitive
    salary along with a comprehensive benefits package,
    including private top-tier healthcare and dental coverage
    with Bupa, a pension scheme with employer contribution, 25
    days of annual leave (excluding bank holidays), 5 flexible
    days to be taken on a Monday or Friday, and a day off for
    your birthday.
