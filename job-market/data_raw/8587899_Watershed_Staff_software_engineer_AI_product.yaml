  About Watershed
  
  Watershed is the enterprise sustainability platform.
  Companies like Airbnb, Carlyle Group, FedEx, Visa, and Dr.
  Martens use Watershed to manage climate and ESG data,
  produce audit-ready metrics for voluntary and regulatory
  reporting including CSRD, and drive real decarbonization. We
  are looking for team members who love product-building, want
  to work hard at a mission-oriented startup, and will
  collaborate with us in shaping the culture of a growing
  team.
  
  We have offices in San Francisco, New York, London, Paris,
  Berlin, Sydney, Mexico City, and remote team members across
  the US and Europe. We hope that you'll be interested in
  joining us!
  
  The role
  
  We're looking for a software engineer to join our
  sustainability AI reporting team. You will be a member of a
  cross functional team building world class AI tools for
  companies to manage and report on their progress in
  sustainability. You'll leverage LLMs, embeddings, and other
  AI technologies to deliver features to our customers, and
  help build the technical foundations for AI at Watershed.
  
  We are looking for this hire to be based in our HQ in London
  4 days per week.
  
  In this role you will:
  
  - Ship code to production on day one
  - Prototype, develop and iterate on a new product area for
    Watershed, giving our customers powerful AI tools for
    information extraction and report generation
  - Productionize and launch core technologies to power AI
    features on top of a wealth of operational sustainability
    data
  - Keep up with developments and state-of-the-art in AI to
    determine what is relevant to Watershed
  - Write performant, well-crafted, tested, and maintainable
    code across our technical stack
  
  You might be a good fit if you have:
  
  - Have 3+ years of software engineering industry experience,
    preferably in Node.js web development
  - Have experience building customer facing products starting
    from user needs
  - Are excited to join a startup and are ready to help evolve a
    growing engineering team
  - Strong full-stack development skills
  
  
  
  
  
  Must be willing to work from an office 4 days per week
  (except for remote roles)
  
  Watershed has hub offices in San Francisco, New York,
  London, and Mexico City and satellite offices in Sydney,
  Paris, and Berlin. Where we have offices, employees are
  expected to be in office for 4 days per week. Certain jobs
  are open to being remote and will be specifically noted on
  the jobs page and in the job description if so.
  
  What’s the interview process like?
  
  It starts the same for every candidate: getting to know the
  team members through 1 to 2 conversations about Watershed,
  your experience, and your interests. Next steps can vary by
  role, but usual next steps are a skill or experience
  interview (e.g. a coding interview for an engineer, a
  portfolio review for a designer, deeper experience call for
  other roles) which leads to a virtual or in person interview
  panel. We prioritize transparency and lack of surprise
  throughout the process.
  
  What if I need accommodations for my interview?
  
  At Watershed, we are dedicated to ensuring an inclusive
  recruitment process. We provide reasonable accommodations
  for candidates with disabilities, long-term conditions,
  mental health needs, religious observances, neurodivergence,
  or pregnancy-related support requirements. If you need
  assistance during your process, please contact your
  recruiter.
