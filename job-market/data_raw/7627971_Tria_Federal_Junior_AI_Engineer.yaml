  Who we are:
  
  Tria Federal delivers digital services and technology
  solutions that support the health and safety of veterans,
  service members and civilians. For two decades, federal
  agencies have relied on Tria companies to advance their
  critical missions and modernize their systems, so that they
  can uphold their commitment to the American people. Today,
  we are pushing the boundaries of possibility through
  partnerships and investments in artificial intelligence and
  emerging technologies, developing solutions for the biggest
  challenges that government will face tomorrow.
  
  We are proud to employ and support military veterans who
  bring mission-first mindset, technical expertise, and
  leadership qualities that strengthen our work. Veterans,
  transitioning service members, and military spouses are
  strongly encouraged to apply.
  
  Tria Federal is assembling a small, high-autonomy team of
  Junior AI Engineers to design and build agentic systems,
  with outcome focused intelligent software agents that
  reason, act, and collaborate to solve real-world problems
  for federal missions.
  
  
  
  This individual will help create systems that automate
  knowledge work, enhance human decision-making, and improve
  digital experiences for millions of Americans, from veterans
  and clinicians to public safety professionals.
  
  
  
  As part of Tria Labs, you’ll shape how generative and
  agentic AI redefines mission delivery, developing tools and
  systems that make digital civic services smarter, faster,
  and more human-centered.
  
  
  
  This is a great opportunity to turn generative AI into
  agents that act, not just respond, and perform where it
  matters the most.
  
  
  
  ***Must be a U.S. citizen due to the security clearance
  required for this position.
  
  
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Build intelligent agents that plan, reason, and interact
    with users, MCP Servers and APIs, using evolving agentic
    frameworks to orchestrate complex business workflows.
  - Engineer end-to-end products — from Python or Node.js
    backends to React or Angular frontend applications that
    embed these agents into secure, mission-critical
    environments.
  - Integrate and experiment with leading AI platforms and
    Foundational Models to design multi-agent workflows and
    retrieval-augmented solutions.
  - Prototype rapidly, test ideas, and push from concept to
    pilot within an agile, builder-driven team.
  - Apply responsible AI and security-minded design, as we build
    systems that interface with sensitive data and secure
    platforms (SSDF awareness a plus).
  
  Qualifications:
  
  - 2–3 years of hands-on experience building and deploying
    full-stack applications (Python, TypeScript, Node.js,
    React/Angular).
  - Practical experience with LLM APIs and generative AI
    frameworks, ideally having built or experimented with
    agentic systems, chat interfaces, or AI copilots.
  - Understanding of data and API orchestration, including
    prompt management, evals, RAG, context handling, and
    connecting AI reasoning to real systems.
  - Exposure to AWS or other cloud platforms for deploying and
    monitoring modern applications.
  - Curiosity, autonomy, and the drive to make AI tangible, you
    thrive in small, multidisciplinary teams where initiative
    matters.
