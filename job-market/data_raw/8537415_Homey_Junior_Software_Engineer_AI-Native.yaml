  About Homey
  
  Moving home in the UK is notoriously slow and stressful. At
  Homey, we are changing that. We are an established, fast-
  growing business using technology to streamline property
  transactions, making the process faster, more transparent,
  and more efficient for everyone involved.
  
  Check us out at Homey.co.uk.
  
  The Role
  
  We aren't looking for 10 years of legacy experience. We are
  looking for smart, adaptable, and ambitious
  engineers—whether you’ve just graduated, finished school, or
  are early in your coding journey.
  
  At Homey, we don't care if you haven't memorized every
  syntax rule—we care that you know how to build things fast.
  We are looking for "AI-Native" engineers: people who see
  LLMs (like Claude Code, Grok, or GitHub Copilot) as their
  superpower to ship high-quality code at speed.
  
  Requirements
  
  Build & Iterate: Develop and maintain features that directly
  impact how people buy and sell homes.
  
  Leverage AI: Use modern AI coding agents and LLMs to
  accelerate your workflow, debug complex issues, and explore
  new solutions.
  
  Problem Solve: Take ownership of tasks from day one with a
  "can-do" attitude—if you don't know the answer, you'll find
  it.
  
  Collaborate: Work closely with a nimble team that values
  fresh perspectives and creative thinking.
  
  Who You Are
  
  Early Career: You are a recent graduate, school leaver, or
  junior dev looking for a place to grow.
  
  Tech Enthusiast: You aren't just "aware" of AI; you are
  actively using tools like Claude Code, Grok, or Cursorto
  write and refine your projects.
  
  High Energy: You have a "can-do" mindset. No task is too
  small, and no challenge is too big.
  
  Curious: You have a genuine interest in how technology can
  disrupt a traditional industry like real estate.
  
  Benefits
  
  Work at an established company with the soul of a startup.
  
  Mentorship from experienced founders who value modern
  development workflows.
  
  The chance to solve a real-world problem that affects
  millions of people.

  your GitHub, a project you’ve built using AI, or just a note
  on why you’re the right fit for Homey.
