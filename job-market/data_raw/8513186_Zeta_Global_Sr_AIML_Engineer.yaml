title: Sr AI/ML Engineer
company: Zeta Global
location: Bengaluru, IND
work_type: FULL_TIME
level: Expert/Leader
company_size: 2,429 Employees
description: |
  As a Senior AI/ML Engineer in our AdTech team, you will be a
  hands-on individual contributor building and deploying
  machine learning models and AI-driven features for our
  advertising platform. You will partner with engineering,
  product, and data science to deliver production-grade ML for
  campaign optimization, user personalization, and creative
  intelligence—operating at large scale and low latency across
  billions of ad events per day. You will contribute to modern
  ML/LLM capabilities and agentic workflows that automate and
  enhance campaign operations, with a strong focus on
  reliability, performance, and measurable business impact.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Machine Learning Delivery: Design, implement, and ship
    scalable ML solutions for core AdTech use cases
    (targeting, ranking, pacing, measurement). Own features
    end-to-end from experimentation to production rollout.
  - ML System Design: Build and evolve the ML lifecycle—data
    preparation, training, evaluation, and real-time
    inference—ensuring models integrate cleanly with ad
    serving systems and meet low-latency, high-throughput
    requirements.
  - Technical Contribution: Contribute to the AI/ML technical
    roadmap by evaluating tools and techniques (including deep
    learning, LLMs, and retrieval/feature systems). Make
    pragmatic trade-offs with an eye toward maintainability
    and operational excellence.
  - AI & Agentic Applications: Develop and integrate LLM-powered
    features and agentic workflows that assist with campaign
    workflows such as audience insights, bid/budget
    recommendations, and creative generation—within well-
    defined guardrails.
  - Cross-Functional Collaboration: Work closely with
    engineering, product, and data science partners to
    translate marketing objectives into ML-driven solutions,
    define success metrics, and deliver iterative
    improvements.
  - Performance & Reliability: Operate ML services in a high-
    concurrency, latency-sensitive environment. Optimize
    inference paths, implement monitoring/alerting, manage
    model drift, and ensure safe deployment practices (A/B
    testing, canaries, rollbacks).
  - Mentorship & Best Practices: Mentor and support other
    engineers through code/model reviews and knowledge
    sharing. Champion engineering rigor in testing,
    observability, documentation, and reproducible ML
    workflows.
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  - 5+ years of experience in software engineering and/or
    applied machine learning, with a track record of shipping
    ML systems to production.
  - Experience designing and building high-throughput, low-
    latency services or data pipelines for large-scale
    applications.
  - Working knowledge of the programmatic advertising ecosystem
    (DSP/SSP/RTB) is a plus; strong adjacent experience
    (recommendation, ranking, marketplaces) is also valued.
  - Proficiency in at least one of Java, Go, or Python for
    backend services and ML tooling.
  - Hands-on experience with ML frameworks (PyTorch or
    TensorFlow) and common modeling approaches
    (classification, ranking, embeddings, deep learning).
  - Experience with big data and streaming frameworks (e.g.,
    Spark, Kafka) for processing and analyzing large datasets.
  - Experience deploying ML to cloud environments (preferably
    AWS) and operating services at scale.
  - Familiarity with data stores (SQL/NoSQL) such as
    PostgreSQL/MySQL, Cassandra/DynamoDB, Redis, etc.
  - Familiarity with containerization/orchestration (Docker,
    Kubernetes) and CI/CD practices.
  - Strong communication skills and ability to collaborate
    across disciplines; comfort explaining technical concepts
    to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Experience with Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative
    AI applied to advertising (e.g., ad copy generation,
    creative optimization, or personalized messaging).
  - Experience designing and implementing agentic workflows that
    support autonomous or semi-autonomous decision-making with
    strong safety/observability guardrails.
  - Experience with model serving and optimization for real-time
    inference (latency-critical environments).
  - Familiarity with modern data lake and table formats (e.g.,
    Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi) for managing large-scale
    analytical datasets.
  - Knowledge of microservices architecture and event-driven
    design patterns in distributed systems.
  - Contributions to open-source projects, publications, or
    speaking engagements that demonstrate thought leadership
    in AI/ML are a plus.
