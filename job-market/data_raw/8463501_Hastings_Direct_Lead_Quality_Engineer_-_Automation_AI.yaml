  Job Title: Lead Quality Engineer - Automation & AI
  
  Location: Bexhill/Leicester/London – Hybrid
  
  Welcome to Hastings Direct
  
  We’re a digital insurance provider with ambitious plans to
  become the best and biggest in the UK market. We’ve made
  huge investments in our pricing and data capabilities over
  the past few years, along with nurturing our 4Cs culture.
  
  We provide insurance for over four million customers, but we
  know there’s even bigger opportunity out there – our
  Pricing, Data and Analytics community value curiosity,
  collaboration and constructive challenge.
  
  We are always looking for new ideas and diverse perspectives
  to question established thinking and drive meaningful
  change. Great pricing is built on trust, innovation and
  precision, so our aim is to ensure customers receive a fair
  and accurate price based on their individual risk,
  supporting fair outcomes, while delivering sustainable and
  profitable growth for our company.
  
  Pricing is more than just a number – it’s a strategic
  capability. At the heart of Hastings is deep risk insight –
  continually improving how we assess, segment and price risk
  through data and analytics.
  
  The Role:
  
  We are seeking a senior, hands-on QA leader to drive
  technological transformation of testing across our pricing
  platforms. This role is responsible for improving quality,
  pace, and confidence of delivery through modern testing
  techniques, automation, and AI-enabled approaches, while
  leading and developing a high-performing QA function. The
  role operates across our in-house based rating engine and
  Azure/GitHub-based engineering landscape. Working closely
  with pricing engineers, ML engineers, and underwriting
  teams, you will modernise how testing is designed, executed,
  and governed, reducing duplication of effort and materially
  lowering post-live issues.
  
  This role combines hands-on technical involvement, strong
  people leadership, and strategic ownership of testing
  capability, tooling, and environments.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Lead end-to-end QA strategy and execution across all
    underwriting lines of business, ensuring testing supports
    high-quality delivery at pace.
  - Design, implement, and continuously evolve the QA strategy
    covering pre-live testing, post-release monitoring, and
    live issue investigation, with a focus on improving
    quality, pace, and confidence of delivery.
  - Provide hands-on technical leadership in reviewing test
    strategies, automation design, and investigation of
    complex or high-impact defects, including interrogation of
    rating behaviour and data inputs.
  - Lead the strategic and practical use of test automation,
    ensuring automation is targeted, maintainable, and focused
    on the highest-risk areas.
  - Drive improvements in automation and tooling to reduce
    manual effort and strengthen preventative quality
    controls, applying AI-assisted techniques where they
    provide clear, measurable benefit.
  - Work closely with pricing engineers and ML teams to apply
    AI-assisted testing techniques where they add value,
    ensuring solutions are governed and suitable for a
    regulated environment.
  - Own post-release quality activities, including monitoring,
    alerting, and validation of controls, ensuring issues are
    detected early and feedback loops are effective.
  - Improve the efficiency, stability, and reliability of QA
    test environments to enable comprehensive data testing
    with minimal environment-related failures.
  - Support incident RCA activity by providing testing insight,
    evidence, and analysis, and ensure learnings are embedded
    into improved testing practices.
  - Line-manage QA Leads and the Automation Manager, providing
    clear direction, prioritisation, coaching, and performance
    support.
  - Ensure QA activities are focused on preventing customer harm
    and supporting compliance with regulatory and internal
    governance requirements.
  - Maintain strong communication and organisational discipline
    to manage multiple initiatives and report progress, risks,
    and outcomes clearly and consistently.
  - Develop and maintain QA documentation, standards, and
    artefacts to ensure testing practices are consistent,
    auditable, and aligned with internal and regulatory
    requirements.
  - Define and track quality metrics such as defect trends, test
    effectiveness, automation coverage, and release readiness
    to support data-driven decisions.
  - Support recruitment and development of QA talent through
    active hiring involvement, regular one-to-one engagement,
    mentoring, and creating an environment where team members
    can perform and grow.
  
  Skills, Knowledge and Expertise
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering,
    or a related field, or equivalent practical experience.
  - Strong experience leading QA or test engineering teams in
    complex, data-driven or regulated technology environments.
  - Hands-on technical capability, with the ability to write,
    read, and review code and actively contribute to test
    design and automation decisions.
  - Strong proficiency in Python, including writing and
    reviewing automated tests and debugging failures in
    complex rules-based or decisioning systems.
  - Proven experience designing and maintaining test automation,
    including API and integration testing using frameworks
    such as pytest, with working knowledge of UI tools such as
    Selenium, Playwright, or Cypress where appropriate.
  - Experience applying AI-assisted testing tools to improve
    coverage, efficiency, or defect detection, with clear
    understanding of governance and control requirements.
  - Practical experience working with Git/GitHub, CI/CD
    pipelines, and Azure-based engineering environments.
  - Strong understanding of modern testing practices, including
    risk-based testing, shift-left quality, and end-to-end
    assurance.
  - Experience working with test environments and test data,
    including validation of complex inputs and outputs using
    SQL and data comparison techniques.
  - Familiarity with test management and defect tracking tools
    such as Azure DevOps and producing clear, meaningful
    quality metrics.
  - Excellent leadership skills, with experience managing senior
    QA roles and automation specialists.
  - Strong stakeholder-management and influencing skills, with
    the ability to balance technical, commercial, and
    governance considerations.
  - Excellent problem-solving skills, with the ability to
    navigate complex pricing and engineering challenges and
    deliver robust solutions.
  - Strong communication skills, able to clearly explain
    technical quality risks and solutions to both technical
    and non-technical stakeholders.
  - Experience working in Agile delivery environments and
    collaborating closely with engineering, data, and ML
    teams.
