  About the Role
  
  We are looking for a Staff Applied AI Engineer to own the
  architecture of our multi-agent LLM reasoning layer that
  turns multimodal evidence (audio + video context +
  transcripts + rules) into validated outputs across our
  products. You will define how agents are decomposed,
  orchestrated, evaluated, and safely promoted into real-time
  production while balancing accuracy, latency, and cost.
  
  You will be trusted to take on complex, ambiguous problems
  and drive them to successful outcomes, applying best
  practices in Agile software development along the way. We
  value engineers who can adapt quickly, learn new
  technologies as needed, and focus on delivering meaningful
  impact rather than being constrained by specific languages
  or frameworks.
  
  We will lean on your technical leadership, pragmatic
  decision-making, and ability to balance short-term delivery
  with long-term system health. You will work in an
  environment that prioritizes Agile principles, continuous
  improvement, and data-driven decision-making. You are
  comfortable forming and testing hypotheses, validating
  assumptions through experimentation, and using evidence to
  guide architectural and product decisions.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Own the end-to-end technical direction for the multi-agent,
    multimodal platform that converts broadcast/radio inputs
    into validated, structured outputs from prototype to
    production.
  - Design and evolve the agent architecture (agent boundaries,
    interfaces, and orchestration patterns), including
    evidence fusion, traceability/provenance, and schema-first
    outputs with versioning and backward compatibility.
  - Define reliability standards for probabilistic systems:
    confidence scoring and gating, escalation paths for low-
    confidence segments (including optional human-in-the-
    loop), and safe correction/overwrite semantics for live
    outputs.
  - Drive performance and cost optimization, selecting routing
    strategies (lightweight vs heavy models), and implementing
    batching/caching/retries that keep quality stable under
    real-time constraints.
  - Partner across product, platform, and domain experts to
    translate ambiguous sport scenarios into system logic.
  - Champion continuous improvement by evaluating new
    technologies, tools, and approaches where they provide
    clear value.
  - Mentor and coach engineers across teams, supporting
    technical growth and raising the overall engineering bar.
  
  Qualifications 
  
  - 10+ years of software engineering experience, including
    owning architecture for complex distributed or data-
    intensive systems.
  - Proven ability to lead through influence: align
    stakeholders, set technical direction, and drive ambiguous
    projects to outcomes.
  - Deep experience with agentic/LLM application architecture
    (tool use, structured outputs, routing)
  - Proven experience with different LLM platforms, including
    but not limited to ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude.
  - Strong understanding of MCP and RAG with production
    implementation experience.
  - Extensive experience designing and working with RESTful APIs
    and distributed services.
  - Experience using version control systems (e.g. Git) in
    collaborative, multi-team environments.
  - Proven ability to solve complex problems and make sound
    technical decisions in ambiguous situations.
  - Ability to work independently while also leading and
    influencing teams without formal authority.
  - Excellent communication skills, with the ability to explain
    complex technical concepts to diverse audiences.
  
  Preferred Qualifications 
  
  - Hands-on experience with multimodal systems
    (audio/video/text).
  - Background in reliability engineering / test engineering
    applied to ML/LLM systems.
  - Experience with multiple architectural and software
    frameworks.
  - Experience working in container based environments (e.g.
    Docker, Kubernetes)
  - Knowledge of modern build pipelines and tools.
  - Familiarity with Agile development methodologies.
  - Experience with testing frameworks.
  
  The salary for this role is based on an annualized range of
  $230,000 - $270,000 USD. This role will also be eligible to
  take part in Genius Sports Group's benefits plan.
  
  We enjoy an ‘office-first’ culture and maximize
  opportunities to collaborate, connect and learn together.
  Our hybrid working models differ depending on your role and
  location. Occasional travel may be required.
