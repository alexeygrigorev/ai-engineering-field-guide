  What will you be doing in this role:
  
  - Define and drive the technical vision for GenAI, agentic AI
    and MCP-based capabilities across multiple product lines.
  - Lead prompt engineering, memory management and MCP-based
    context orchestration for scalable AI systems.
  - Design and optimize RAG, enterprise knowledge and MCP-backed
