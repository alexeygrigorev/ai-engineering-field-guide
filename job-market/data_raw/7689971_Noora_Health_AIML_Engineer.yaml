  WHO WE ARE
  
  Noora Health India Private Limited is a key partner in Noora
  Health's mission is to improve outcomes and strengthen
  health systems by equipping family caregivers with the
  skills they need to care for their loved ones. They develop
  content, technology platforms, new products, and strengthen
  other operational functions that support the scale and
  impact of Noora Health’s programs.
  
  Founded in 2014, Noora Health turns hospital hallways and
  waiting rooms into classrooms by tapping into the most
  compassionate resources available for the patient’s care:
  their own family.
  
  With support from governments and partners in India,
  Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Nepal, Noora Health has trained
  more than 35 million caregivers and patients across 12,600+
  facilities using their flagship caregiver education and
  training curriculum, the Care Companion Program (CCP).
  
  In a cohort of patients, the CCP reduced post-surgical
  cardiac complications by 71%, maternal complications by 12%,
  newborn complications by 16%, and newborn mortality by 18%.
  
  Noora Health is an Audacious Project Grantee and received
  the Skoll Foundation Award for Social Innovation. To learn
  more, watch our TED Talk, Skoll feature, or read about our
  partnership with the World Health Organization.
  
  WHAT YOU WILL DO
  
  - Build AI systems end-to-end: curate data, preprocess,
    prototype, deploy, and monitor performance in production.
  - Define success metrics for each model or pipeline and
    iterate to improve accuracy, relevance, and efficiency.
  - Integrate AI features into existing product infrastructure
    with attention to performance and scalability.
  - Provide guidance on best practices and encourage the
    adoption of cutting-edge AI/ML techniques.
  - Document research findings and share knowledge across teams.
  - Collaborate with engineers, product managers, designers, and
    clinical experts to identify where AI can improve user
    experience and care delivery.
  
  WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR
  
  - 4+ years of experience in AI/Machine Learning with
    Bachelor's or Master's in Computer Science, AI, Machine
    Learning, or related field, or equivalent demonstrated
    experience through projects.
  - Empirical approach to problem-solving: you analyze data,
    models, and errors methodically to drive measurable
    improvements.
  - Proficient in Python and solid machine learning
    fundamentals.
  - Built and shipped at least one deep learning project
    (computer vision, NLP, or RL) from dataset curation
    through model/pipeline building, evaluation, deployment
    and continuous improvements through iterations.
  - Experience with cloud platforms (GCP, AWS, or Azure) and
    databases (SQL, NoSQL).
  - Clear communicator who balances theoretical knowledge with
    practical constraints.
  
  - You are a builder at heart, obsess about the user problem
    and solutions you work on, and are innately curious to
    learn more and get better at what you do.

  We value diversity, equity, and inclusion, and we understand
  the value of developing a team with different perspectives,
  educational backgrounds, and life experiences. We prioritize
  diversity within our team, and we welcome candidates from
