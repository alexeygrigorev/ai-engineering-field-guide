  NVIDIA is widely considered to be one of the technology
  world’s most desirable employers. We have some of the most
  forward-thinking and hardworking people in the world working
  for us. If you're creative and autonomous and interested in
  AI Infrastructure, we want to hear from you!
  
  
  What You Will Be Doing:
  
  - Develop and maintain large-scale systems supporting critical
    use-cases including frontier model training for AI
    Infrastructure, driving reliability, operability, and
    scalability across global public and private clouds.
  - Collaborate on tooling for HPC, GPU Training, and AI Model
    training workflows.
  - Build tools and frameworks to improve observability, define
    actionable reliability metrics, and enable fast issue
    resolution, driving continuous improvement in system
    performance.
  - Establish frameworks for operational maturity, lead
    sustainable incident response protocols, and conduct
    blameless postmortems to improve team efficiency and
    system resilience.
  - Implement SRE fundamentals, including incident management,
    monitoring, and performance optimization, while designing
    automation tools to reduce manual processes and
    operational overhead.
  - Work with engineering teams to deliver innovative solutions,
    uphold high standards for code and infrastructure, and
    contribute to hiring for a diverse, high-performing team.
  
  What We Need to See:
  
  - Degree in Computer Science or related field, or equivalent
    experience with 5+ years in Software Development, SRE, or
    Production Engineering.
  - Proficiency in Python and at least one other language
    (C/C++, Go, Perl, Ruby).
  - Expertise in systems engineering within Linux or Windows
    environments and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, or
    OCI).
  - Strong understanding of SRE principles, including error
    budgets, SLOs, SLAs, and Infrastructure as Code tools
    (e.g., Terraform CDK).
  - Hands-on experience with observability platforms (e.g., ELK,
    Prometheus, Loki) and CI/CD systems (e.g., GitLab).
  - Strong communication skills with the ability to convey
    technical concepts effectively to diverse audiences.
  - Commitment to fostering a culture of diversity, curiosity,
    and continuous improvement.
  
  Ways to stand out from the crowd:
  
  - Experience in AI training, inferencing, and data
    infrastructure services.
  - Proficiency in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch,
    TensorFlow, JAX, and Ray.
  - A strong background in cloud or hardware health monitoring
    and system reliability.
  - Hands-on expertise in operating and scaling distributed
    systems with stringent SLAs, ensuring high availability
    and performance.
  - Knowledge of incident, change, and problem management
    processes, fostering continuous improvement in
    sophisticated environments.
  
  Widely considered to be one of the technology world’s most
  desirable employers, NVIDIA offers highly competitive
  salaries and a comprehensive benefits package. As you plan
  your future, see what we can offer to you and your family
