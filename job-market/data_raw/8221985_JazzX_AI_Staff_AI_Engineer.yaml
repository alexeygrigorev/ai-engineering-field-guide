  About JazzX AI:
  
  
  
  Vision: Enterprises operating on institutional
  intelligence—governed, self-improving, and scalable beyond
  individual expertise.
  
  JazzX AI is defining the future of enterprise work—by
  building AI-native digital workers that actually get the job
  done.
  
  
  
  We believe enterprises don't scale expertise—they lose it.
  Knowledge stays trapped in individuals, judgment gets
  applied inconsistently, and the best talent spends time on
  work that should run itself. We're changing that.
  
  JazzX AI transforms messy enterprise reality into
  institutional intelligence: governed digital workers that
  capture expert judgment, make every decision explainable,
  and continuously improve through real-world execution. The
  result is faster decisions, higher-quality outcomes, and
  reliable execution at scale—in domains where getting it
  wrong isn't an option.
  
  
  
  We're starting with lending and due-diligence
  workflows—complex, regulated, high-stakes. From here, we're
  building the backbone for enterprise intelligence across
  industries.
  
  
  
  This is early-stage, hard, and consequential work. If you
  want to be part of bringing AI systems to market that
  actually run in production, handle real complexity, and
  deliver real outcomes—not demos, not chatbots—JazzX AI is
  the place.
  
  Headquartered in Los Altos, CA. Backed by SAIGroup.

  About JazzX AI
  
  JazzX AI delivers value across the full AI application
  lifecycle:
  
  - Next-Generation Enterprise AI PlatformA robust, production-
    grade AI platform that orchestrates foundation models,
    reasoning systems, agents, retrieval, evaluation, and
    guardrails—designed for reliability, safety, and scale.
  - AI Builder Studio (Low-Code / No-Code)A cutting-edge Builder
    Studio that allows developers and non-developers alike to
    design, compose, and deploy AI-powered applications and
    workflows using visual and declarative abstractions.
  - First-Party Enterprise ApplicationsA suite of customer-
    facing enterprise applications built on the same platform
    and Builder Studio, ensuring dogfooding, rapid iteration,
    and real-world validation at scale.
  
  Together, this creates a tightly integrated SaaS + PaaS
  offering, where platform capabilities, tooling, and
  applications evolve in lockstep. We are starting with
  residential lending, a domain defined by deep due diligence,
  complex policies, and expert judgment, and are building a
  horizontal platform that will power intelligent applications
  across multiple knowledge-intensive industries.
  
  Role Overview
  
  As a Staff AI Research Engineer, you will play a pivotal
  role in shaping the core AI platform, the Builder Studio
  abstractions, and the AI capabilities powering JazzX’s
  enterprise applications.
  
  This is a hands-on Staff-level individual contributor role.
  You will work across platform, tooling, and
  applications—designing and validating how foundation models,
  reasoning systems, and agentic workflows can be safely,
  reliably, and intuitively consumed by both engineers and
  non-technical users.
  
  Your work will directly influence:
  
  - How AI systems are composed and deployed via low-code / no-
    code interfaces
  - How customer-facing AI applications behave in production
  - How JazzX balances power, safety, observability, and
    usability across its SaaS and PaaS offerings
  
  What You Will Do1. Applied AI Research & Experimentation
  
  - Explore and evaluate foundation models, reasoning models,
    multimodal models, and agentic workflows for enterprise
    use cases.
  - Design experiments to understand model capabilities, limits,
    failure modes, and trade-offs.
  - Assess how advanced AI techniques (RAG, dynamic prompting,
    RL, knowledge graphs, ontologies) can be abstracted safely
    into a Builder Studio experience.
  
  2. Platform & System Architecture
  
  - Design core AI platform components for:
    - Model orchestration and routing
    - Agent execution and state management
    - Context, memory, and retrieval pipelines
    - Evaluation, observability, and guardrails
  - Define architectural patterns that work across platform
    APIs, low-code builders, and end-user applications.
  
  3. Builder Studio Enablement (Low-Code / No-Code)
  
  - Help design declarative abstractions and primitives that
    allow AI workflows to be composed visually or via
    configuration.
  - Ensure that low-code experiences do not compromise
    correctness, safety, or performance.
  - Work closely with UX, product, and platform teams to
    translate complex AI systems into intuitive building
    blocks.
  
  4. First-Party Application Development
  
  - Collaborate on building and evolving customer-facing
    enterprise AI applications using the JazzX platform and
    Builder Studio.
  - Use these applications as real-world feedback loops to
    validate platform design decisions.
  - Drive a strong dogfooding culture, ensuring the platform is
    battle-tested at scale.
  
  5. Evaluation, Reliability & Safety
  
  - Design and implement evaluation pipelines to continuously
    measure system quality.
  - Develop strategies for hallucination mitigation, grounding,
    human-in-the-loop workflows, and deterministic guardrails.
  - Ensure AI systems behave predictably in enterprise
    environments with high trust requirements.
  
  6. Technical Leadership & Influence
  
  - Serve as a Staff-level technical leader, influencing
    architecture and long-term platform direction.
  - Mentor engineers and scientists on applied AI system design
    and AI-native engineering practices.
  - Contribute to technical standards, RFCs, and cross-team
    architectural decisions.
  
  What We’re Looking ForRequired Qualifications
  
  - 10+ years of experience in applied AI, AI engineering, or
    AI-driven platform development.
  - Strong hands-on experience building production-grade AI
    systems, not just prototypes or demos.
  - Expert-level proficiency in Python, with a deep
    understanding of its ecosystem for building, scaling, and
    deploying production-grade AI services and orchestration
    layers.
  - Deep experience working with AI foundation models (LLMs,
    reasoning models, multimodal models).
  - Solid understanding of AI agents, orchestration frameworks,
    and evaluation methodologies.
  - Experience with frameworks such as OpenAI SDK, LangChain,
    AutoGen, CrewAI, or equivalent.
  - Knowledge of or experience with reinforcement learning,
    ontologies, knowledge graphs, or hybrid AI approaches.
  - Preferred - Ph.D. or MS in Computer Science, AI, or a
    related field.
  - Strong analytical and systems-thinking skills.
  
  What Sets You Apart
  
  - You enjoy working across layers—from models to platforms to
    end-user applications.
  - You can translate cutting-edge AI capabilities into safe,
    usable, and scalable abstractions.
  - You thrive in ambiguous environments and can define both the
    problem and the solution.
  - You lead through technical influence and execution, not
    hierarchy.
  - You care deeply about production readiness, reliability, and
    user trust.
