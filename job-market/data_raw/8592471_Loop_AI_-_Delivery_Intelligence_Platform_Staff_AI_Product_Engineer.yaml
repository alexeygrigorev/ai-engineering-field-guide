  About Loop: At Loop, we’re revolutionizing restaurant
  operations with AI-powered automation. Our technology helps
  restaurants streamline their workflows, reduce costs, and
  enhance customer experiences—all through intelligent
  automation. We’re a fast-moving, early-stage startup on a
  rapid growth trajectory, and we need a technical leader to
  build and scale our engineering team from the ground up.
  
  Role Overview:
  
  As a Staff Product Engineer, you will own a broad technical
  scope spanning frontend, backend, and AI systems. You’ll
  design, build, and scale features across the full product
  stack — from user-facing UI to robust backend services and
  AI-driven components. You’ll work directly with product,
  design, data, and leadership to deliver high-impact
  solutions that push our platform forward.
  
  This position is ideal for engineers who love building
  across the stack, enjoy solving complex problems, and want
  to deeply influence both product direction and technical
  architecture.
  
  Key Responsibilities:
  
  - Full-Stack Development: Lead design and implementation of
    scalable frontend architecture using modern web
    technologies. Translate UI/UX designs into responsive,
    accessible, and performant applications. Build and
    maintain backend systems and APIs to power core product
    functionality. Ensure smooth integration between frontend
    interfaces and backend services.
  - Architecture & Best Practices: Contribute to high-level
    architecture decisions across the stack.Create scalable,
    maintainable systems with high code quality. Apply
    critical thinking to propose innovative solutions and
    continuously improve technical processes.
  - Cross-Functional Collaboration: Partner with product
    managers, designers, and engineers to define and
    prioritize roadmap features. Participate in customer-
    focused discussions to understand pain points and
    translate them into technical solutions. Mentor and guide
    team members, championing best practices and high
    engineering standards.
  - AI Systems: Collaborate on AI-driven features, integrating
    models or intelligent workflows into platform
    components.Help design systems that support data
    pipelines, model inference, and AI feedback loops.
  
  Qualifications:
  
  - 6+ years professional experience building production-grade
    software.
  - Solid backend experience — building services, APIs, and
    database integrations with Python, Django, or comparable
    stacks.
  - Demonstrated ability to work across frontend and backend
    contexts with clean, maintainable code.
  - Experience with version control, deployment pipelines, and
    performance optimization.
  - A proactive mindset and ability to work independently in a
    fast-paced startup environment.
  
  Nice to Have:
  
  - Experience building or working with AI agentic workflows,
    including orchestration, tool usage, and multi-step
    reasoning systems.
  - Strong frontend expertise in React.js, including performance
    optimization and scalable component architecture.
  - Ability to think beyond pure engineering — strong business
    and product acumen.
  - Demonstrated curiosity and interest in working backwards
    from the customer, identifying real pain points, and
    translating them into technical solutions.
  - Passion for building end-to-end features that create
    measurable product impact.
