  NVIDIA is looking for a passionate, world-class computer
  scientist to work in its Compute Developer Technology
  (Devtech) team as an AI Developer Technology Engineer.
  Artificial intelligence, the dream of computer scientists
  for over half a century, is no longer science fiction. And
  in the next few years, it will transform every industry.
  Soon, self-driving cars will reduce congestion and improve
  road safety. AI travel agents will know your preferences and
  arrange every detail of your family vacation. And medical
  instruments will read and understand patient DNA to detect
  and treat early signs of cancer. Where engines made us
  stronger and powered the first industrial revolution, AI
  will make us smarter and power the next. What will make this
  intelligent industrial revolution possible? A new computing
  model — GPU deep learning — that enables computers to learn
  from data and write software that is too complex for people
  to code.
  
  What you will be doing:
  
  - Study and develop cutting-edge techniques in deep learning,
    graphs, machine learning, and data analytics, and perform
    in-depth analysis and optimization to ensure the best
    possible performance on current- and next-generation GPU
    architectures.
  - Work directly with key customers to understand the current
    and future problems they are solving and provide the best
    AI solutions using GPUs.
  - Collaborate closely with the architecture, research,
    libraries, tools, and system software teams at NVIDIA to
    influence the design of next-generation architectures,
    software platforms, and programming models.
  
  What we need to see:
  
  - A Masters degree or PhD in an engineering or computer
    science related discipline or equivalent experience and 2+
    years of relevant work or research experience.
  - Strong knowledge of C/C++, software design, programming
    techniques, and AI algorithms.
  - Firsthand work experience with parallel programming, ideally
    CUDA C/C++.
  - Strong communication and organization skills, with a logical
    approach to problem solving, good time management, and
    task prioritization skills.
  - Some travel is required for conferences and for on-site
    visits with developers.
  
  NVIDIA is widely considered to be one of the technology
  world’s most desirable employers. We have some of the most
  forward-thinking and hardworking people in the world working
  for us. Are you a creative and autonomous computer scientist
  with a genuine passion for parallel computing? If so, we
  want to hear from you. Come, join our AI Compute DevTech
  team and help build the real-time, cost-effective computing
  platform driving our success in this exciting and quickly
  growing field.
  
  NVIDIA is committed to fostering a diverse work environment
  and proud to be an equal opportunity employer. As we highly
  value diversity in our current and future employees, we do
  not discriminate (including in our hiring and promotion
  practices) on the basis of race, religion, color, national
  origin, gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, age,
  marital status, veteran status, disability status or any
  other characteristic protected by law.
