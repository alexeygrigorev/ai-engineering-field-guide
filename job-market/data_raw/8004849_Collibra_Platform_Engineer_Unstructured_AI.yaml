  Joining Collibra’s Engineering team
  
  We’re shaping the way some of the largest organizations in
  the world manage data by helping customers connect the right
  data and insights for all Data Citizens. We are building a
  team of exceptional people to help us deliver on that
  promise. As a Platform Engineer, you are the guiding force
  behind bringing Collibra's product and vision to customers
  and prospects. Responsible for both net-new and expansion
  opportunities in existing accounts. Platform Engineers
  establish knowledgeable and trusted relationships from day
  one and serve as thoughtful technical advisors.
  
  This is a hybrid role based in our New York office. Our
  hybrid model means you’ll work from the office at least two
  days each week. This setup helps us stay connected, work
  more closely together, and keep making progress as a team.
  
  Platform Engineers at Collibra are responsible for
  
  - Designing, implementing, and maintaining the infrastructure
    blueprint that enables customers to deploy our
    Unstructured AI application in their own cloud
    environments (AWS, GCP, Azure).
  - Codifying infrastructure as code (Terraform), building
    modular, secure, and reproducible configurations that
    support flexible deployment scenarios, including bring-
    your-own VPC, custom networking, and varied customer
    setups.
  - Managing and evolving the deployment stack, including
    Kubernetes and Helm-based deployments of the Unstructured
    AI application, and supporting components such as
    databases, secrets, and user authentication and SSO.
  - Set up and maintaining monitoring, alerting, and
    observability systems (e.g. Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana)
    to ensure operational visibility and proactive incident
    detection.
  - Participating in incident response and troubleshooting for
    customer-deployed environments, using observability data
    to diagnose and resolve issues quickly.
  - Collaborating with the application team to implement python
    code and configuration changes supporting evolving
    infrastructure, authentication, and deployment patterns.
  - Building tools and services to automate product updates,
    simplifying upgrades and ongoing maintenance of the
    Unstructured AI application..
  - Working closely with product and field engineering teams to
    ensure reliable, scalable, and easily deployable
    infrastructure for every customer.
  
  You are
  
  - Someone who takes pride in designing clean, modular
    infrastructure that scales across clouds and deployment
    models.
  - Comfortable working at the intersection of application and
    infrastructure, ensuring the Unstructured AI product runs
    smoothly and efficiently.
  - Someone who thinks in automation and maintainability,
    building systems that are resilient, secure, and easy to
    operate.
  - Actively taking ownership in rapidly evolving environments,
    adapting infrastructure and deployments as the
    Unstructured AI product grows and changes.
  - Someone who prioritizes observability, reliability, and
    performance as integral parts of product delivery.
  - Experienced in collaborating effectively with engineers
    across domains to deliver robust, production-ready
    systems.
  
  You have
  
  - 2+ years of engineering or technical experience with strong
    exposure to infrastructure, cloud, or platform work.
  - Strong experience with Terraform or similar infrastructure-
    as-code tools and modular deployment best practices.
  - Good understanding of Kubernetes, Helm, and container
    orchestration.
  - Experience deploying and managing workloads in at least one
    major cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
  - python application code experience to align infrastructure
    and deployment patterns.
  - Familiarity with networking, IAM, and security
    configurations, including VPC design and private
    networking.
  - Experience with deployment automation and CI/CD pipelines,
    including container image management (ECR, GCR, ACR).
  - Hands-on experience with monitoring, observability, and
    incident response, debugging distributed systems using
    tools like Datadog, Prometheus, or Grafana.
  - A background in DevOps, SRE, or platform engineering for
    complex, customer-deployed applications.
  - A bachelor’s degree or equivalent related working experience
    is required.
  - This position is not eligible for visa sponsorship.

  - Within your first month, you’ll understand the Unstructured
    AI deployment architecture across clouds and begin
    contributing small improvements to Terraform and Helm
    configurations.
  - Within your third month, you’ll lead enhancements that
    improve the reliability, visibility, and maintainability
    of customer deployments across different environments.
  - Within your sixth month, you’ll drive major automation
    initiatives that simplify ongoing operations, upgrades,
    and scalability for the Unstructured AI platform.
