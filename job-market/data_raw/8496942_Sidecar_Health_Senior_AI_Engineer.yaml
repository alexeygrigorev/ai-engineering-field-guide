description: |
  Sidecar Health is redefining health insurance. Our mission
  is to make excellent healthcare affordable and accessible
  for everyone. We know that to accomplish this lofty mission,
  we need driven people who will make things happen.
  
  The passionate people who make up Sidecar Health’s team come
  from all over, with backgrounds as tech leaders, policy
  makers, healthcare professionals, and beyond. And they all
  have one thing in common—the desire to fix a broken system
  and make it more personalized, affordable, and transparent.
  
  If you want to use your talents to transform healthcare in
  the United States, come join us!
  
  About the Role
  
  Our AI Platform team is central to our mission. We build
  intelligent, production-grade systems that power member
  experiences, operational efficiency, and core business
  workflows.
  
  We’re looking for builders. Not architects who only
  whiteboard. Not managers who delegate. Builders — engineers
  who ship high-quality production code, move quickly, and
  take full ownership from design to deployment.
  
  As a Senior AI Engineer on our AI Platform team, you will
  design, architect, and deploy AI-powered systems that
  directly impact real members and real business outcomes. You
  will operate across the full lifecycle — from system design
  and prompt architecture to production deployment and
  observability. This role requires deep expertise in LLM
  systems, distributed cloud infrastructure, and the ability
  to ship reliable, scalable AI applications in production.
  **MUST BE BASED IN CALIFORNIA**
  
  What You'll Do
  
  - Design, architect, and deploy AI-powered systems that
    directly impact member experience and operational
    efficiency
  - Build and optimize LLM-driven applications using advanced
    prompt engineering, RAG architectures, and agentic
    workflows
  - Design scalable AI pipelines using modern orchestration
    frameworks (LangChain, LangSmith, LlamaIndex, etc.)
  - Architect multi-agent systems capable of reasoning,
    planning, and executing complex multi-step tasks
  - Implement evaluation and monitoring frameworks to measure AI
    performance, detect hallucinations, and ensure reliability
    at scale
  - Own cloud-native AI infrastructure for performance,
    scalability, cost efficiency, and security
  - Partner with Product and Engineering leadership to identify
    and execute high-impact AI initiatives
  - Stay at the frontier of the AI ecosystem and translate
    emerging capabilities into production-ready systems
  - Establish internal standards, tooling, and best practices
    for AI development across the organization
  
  What You'll Bring
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science,
    Information Systems, Business Administration, or a related
    field
  - 5+ years of professional software engineering experience,
    including meaningful ownership of production systems
  - Significant hands-on experience building and deploying AI/ML
    systems in production
  - Strong proficiency in Python and TypeScript (Next.js a plus)
  - Deep experience with LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS
    Bedrock) and orchestration frameworks (LangChain,
    LangSmith, LlamaIndex)
  - Strong understanding of advanced prompt engineering
    techniques and LLM optimization strategies
  - Experience designing and deploying RAG systems, vector
    databases, and semantic search applications
  - Cloud infrastructure expertise (AWS preferred): Lambda, Step
    Functions, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3
  - Strong understanding of LLM behavior: tokenization,
    embeddings, context limits, evaluation, and hallucination
    mitigation
  - Demonstrated track record of shipping scalable, production-
    grade AI systems — not prototypes or demos
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Experience with infrastructure as code (AWS CDK, SAM,
    Terraform)
  - Experience in healthcare, insurance, or regulated
    environments
  - Experience fine-tuning models or building custom model
    pipelines
  - Familiarity with observability tools (DataDog, CloudWatch,
    LangSmith)
  - Contributions to open-source AI projects or published
    technical work
  
  The Reality
  
  This is a startup. We move fast. We prioritize impact over
  polish. We expect:
  
  - Bias for action — ship, learn, iterate
  - Ownership — you design it, build it, run it
  - Pragmatism — solve real problems, not theoretical ones
  - Resilience — ambiguity comes with the territory
  
  Healthcare is complex and broken. The work matters.
  
  What You'll Get
  
  - Competitive salary, bonus opportunity, and equity package
  - Comprehensive Medical, Dental, and Vision benefits
  - A 401k retirement plan
  - Paid vacation and company holidays
  - Opportunity to make an impact at a rapidly growing mission-
    driven company transforming healthcare in the U.S.
  
  Sidecar Health is an Equal Opportunity employer committed to
  building a diverse team. We do not discriminate on the basis
  of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual
  orientation, age, marital status, veteran status or
  disability status.
