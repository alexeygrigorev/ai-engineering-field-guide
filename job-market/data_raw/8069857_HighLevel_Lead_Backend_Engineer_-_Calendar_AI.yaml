  network of over 250 microservices, and supports over 1
  million hostnames.
  
  Our People:
  
  With over 1,500 team members across 15+ countries, we
  operate in a global, remote-first environment. We are
  building more than software; we are building a global
  community rooted in creativity, collaboration, and impact.
  We take pride in cultivating a culture where innovation
  thrives, ideas are celebrated, and people come first, no
  matter where they call home.
  
  Our Impact:
  
  As of mid 2025, our platform powers over 1.5 billion
  messages, helps generate over 200 million leads, and
  facilitates over 20 million conversations for the more than
  2 million businesses we serve each month. Behind those
  numbers are real people growing their companies, connecting
  with customers, and making their mark - and we get to help
  make that happen.
  
  About the Role:
  
  We are building an AI-first scheduling and booking
  intelligence layer on top of a universal Calendars &
  Availability Platform. As the Lead Engineer for the Calendar
  AI Team, you will architect and deliver AI systems that
  assist users during setup, configuration, and optimization
  of their booking systems - and evolve this into a full AI-
  driven scheduling engine that optimizes capacity,
  utilisation, and resource allocation.
  
  You will lead the design of LLM workflows, RAG pipelines,
  retrieval layers, embeddings, context builders, scheduling-
  aware reasoning modules, optimisation algorithms, and
  backend integrations. You will also guide and mentor
  engineers as the AI team grows.
  
  This is a deeply technical role with a strong emphasis on AI
  engineering + System Design + scheduling domain logic.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Design and implement LLM-powered onboarding assistants using
    Google/OpenAI/Anthropic models with deterministic
    orchestration (LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom pipelines)
  - Build RAG workflows using vector databases (Pinecone,
    Weaviate, Qdrant, pgvector) to inject contextual booking
    data into model prompts
  - Develop AI-driven configuration engines that translate
    natural language into structured booking primitives
    (services, schedules, resources, capacity, pricing rules)
  - Design optimization models for resource utilization,
    workload distribution, capacity forecasting, and conflict
    reduction
  - Integrate AI pipelines into backend systems using
    Node.js/TypeScript/Go services
  - Build scheduling-aware reasoning modules that handle
    constraints, buffers, lead times, resource availability,
    and business rules
  - Create scalable data pipelines for embeddings generation,
    context indexing, and model fine-tuning/hybrid retrieval
  - Implement latency-optimized inference orchestration with
    streaming responses, caching, and hybrid decision engines
  - Own the AI Runtime Layer enabling vertical-specific booking
    logic, plugins, actions, and smart suggestions
  - Lead and mentor the engineering team, enforce architectural
    standards, and drive long-term AI roadmap
  
  Requirements:
  
  - 5+ years of backend engineering experience, with at least 2
    years building LLM, RAG or intelligent systems
  - Experience with OpenAI/Anthropic/Google/Meta LLMs (GPT-4+,
    Claude, Gemini, Llama)
  - Strong with LangChain, LlamaIndex, or custom LLM
    orchestration frameworks
  - Expertise with RAG architectures
  - Experience building prompt pipelines, tools/agents, and
    compound reasoning workflows
  - Comfort with guardrails, validation layers, hallucination
    reduction, and safety
  - Strong proficiency in Node.js/TypeScript/Go for platform
    integration
