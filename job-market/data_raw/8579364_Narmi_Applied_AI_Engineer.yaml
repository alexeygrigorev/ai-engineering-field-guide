  About Us
  
  Narmi is how community financial institutions unlock the
  very latest capabilities in digital banking, account
  opening, and lending so they can move faster, tap new growth
  opportunities, and be where banking is going. Since our
  founding, Narmi has enabled the movement of billions of
  dollars and the opening of hundreds of thousands of accounts
  for banks and credit unions across the U.S. The results
  speak for themselves: our customers have grown deposits,
  revenue, and customer satisfaction, with one of the first
  institutions powered by Narmi recognized by Bankrate and
  NerdWallet for delivering the #1 digital banking experience
  in the country.
  
  About the role
  
  AI is easy to demo. It’s hard to ship. We’re hiring someone
  to ship it.
  
  Narmi powers digital banking for community banks and credit
  unions serving 130+ million Americans. These institutions
  operate in regulated environments where inconsistent AI
  output isn’t a nuisance; it’s a compliance risk. That means
  the bar for shipping is high, and the pace needs to be fast.
  
  We’re hiring a Staff AI Engineer to own end-to-end delivery
  of AI-powered features into production across dozens of our
  customers environments. You’ll build the features, build the
  reliability infrastructure that makes them shippable, and
  establish the standards that make the next feature faster to
  deliver than the last.
  
  This is a horizontal, Staff-level role. You will influence
  how AI is built across the company.
  
  At Narmi, how we work is just as important as what we build.
  We call this The Narmi Standard:
  
  - High Ceiling: You go beyond the obvious, take initiative,
    and hold yourself to high standards with care.
  - Low Ego: You put the mission above ourselves, share credit
    freely, and lead with curiosity.
  - Alignment to Mission: You believe that helping community
    financial institutions win against Mega Banks and FinTechs
    is a worthy endeavor, and will use that belief as a
    northstar to anchor your efforts to that goal.
  - High Commitment: You follow through, roll up your sleeves,
    and keep the bar high for yourself and others.
  
  What you’ll do:
  
  - Own AI features from ideation to prototype to production
    release under our customers environments, and enable easy
    monitoring of success
  - Embed closely with customer teams, understand their needs,
    and guide the adoption of what to build
  - Codify working patterns into tools, playbooks, or building
    blocks that others can use
  - Build evaluation and regression systems that validate the
    model and prompt changes before release
  - Design monitoring that detects output degradation within
    hours, not days
  
  
  
  Shipping is the goal. The infrastructure you will help us
  build enables us to ship at pace in a regulated environment.
  
  What you’ll bring:
  
  - 5+ years of software engineering experience
  - Direct experience shipping GenAI or agentic systems into
    production and supporting them afterwards
  - Write and review production-grade code across frontend and
    backend using Python, JavaScript, or comparable stacks
  - Experience building evaluation, monitoring, or ML
    infrastructure, and opinions on what makes these systems
    work well
  - Deep understanding of non-deterministic system behavior and
    failure modes
  - Strong backend engineering skills
  - Ability to operate across engineering, product, and
    compliance
  
  Nice to have:
  
  •  Fintech or regulated industry experience
  
  •  White-label SaaS platform experience
  
  We are not looking for someone learning AI on the job. We’re
  looking for someone who has already seen it break and been
  there to fix it.
  
  Impact
  
  •   Accelerate the pace at which AI-powered features reach
  production
  
  •   Shorten model rollout cycles across the partner fleet
  
  •   Increase partner trust and adoption of AI capabilities
  
  •   Build the reliability foundation that makes speed
  sustainable
  
  You will be the reason we ship aggressively without shipping
  recklessly.
  
  The expected annual base salary for this role is $160,000 -
  $254,000. Base salary is only part of your total
  compensation. In addition to base salary, you will receive
  an equity option grant, and are eligible for performance-
  based cash and equity bonuses. Compensation included in an
  offer will be commensurate with the candidate’s skills,
  experience and geographic location. Compensation ranges for
  candidates located outside of New York City may differ. You
  will also receive a full benefits package.
  
  We believe that high-performing teams include people from
  different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each
  other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we
  actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those
  from historically marginalized groups.
