  About Standard Bots
  
  At Standard Bots, we're revolutionizing real-world
  automation by making robotic systems accessible to everyone.
  Our AI-powered platform enables robots to tackle
  unprecedented challenges through an intuitive instruction
  interface, bringing the power of software automation to
  physical spaces.
  
  About the Role
  
  We're seeking an AI Research Engineer to develop and
  optimize our AI models and training systems. This is an
  exciting opportunity to apply your deep ML expertise to
  cutting-edge AI/robotics applications. You'll work closely
  with our engineering team to design, implement, and iterate
  on large-scale AI models while building efficient systems
  for rapid experimentation and deployment. We have a small
  team of AI engineers, so we’re looking for someone who is
  excited to work at a startup, and work across the stack to
  do what is needed to get a model that achieves a customer
  problem.
  
  We're looking for an experienced engineer ready to make a
  tangible impact in the AI robotics revolution. This role
  requires a proven background working on ML planning within
  the autonomous vehicle space with experience using the
  latest techniques in diffusion and autoregressive models in
  a professional setting. If you're excited about building the
  latest advancements in AI and working in the robotics space,
  we’d love to hear from you.
  
  In this role, you will:
  
  - Design and implement state of the art ML models and training
    pipelines:
    - Apply novel machine learning techniques to wide range of
      robotics applications
    - Develop efficient data and training strategies
    - Implement model evaluation frameworks and metrics tracking
  - Lead model development and iteration with focus on:
    - Rapid experimentation and prototyping of new model
      architectures
    - Performance optimization and model debugging
    - Transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies
  - Build robust evaluation and debugging systems to:
    - Analyze model behavior and failure modes
    - Implement interpretability tools and visualization
      frameworks
    - Track and improve model metrics
  - Collaborate with engineering team to optimize training
    infrastructure and deployment
  
  You might thrive in this role if you:
  
  - Have 5+ years of AI modeling experience, specifically within
    the self-driving car industry (or PhD with 3+ years of AI
    modeling experience in the self-driving car industry)
  - Proven track record developing and deploying large-scale ML
    models
  - Have experience using the latest techniques in diffusion and
    autoregressive models in a professional setting
  - Are familiar with training inference and infra pipelines
    that go from camera input to trajectory output for self
    driving or robotics
  - Have experience with RL (reinforcement learning)
  - Have a strong understanding of modern ML architectures and
    training techniques
  - Have experience with model debugging, optimization, and
    performance tuning
  - Have a background in implementing ML research papers and
    adapting academic work
  
  Tech Stack
  
  - PyTorch (experience with PyTorch required)
  - Python
  - NodeJS/Typescript
  - Docker
  
  Compensation and Benefits:
  
  The salary range for this role is $225,000 to $300,000,
  depending on experience. We are open to a variety of
  seniority levels for this role and will build compensation
  packages that are commensurate with seniority and skill
  level. Base salary is just one part of the overall
  compensation at Standard Bots. All Full-Time Employees are
  eligible for Employee Stock Options. We also offer a package
  of benefits including paid time off, medical/dental/vision
  insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, and 401(k)
  to regular full-time employees.
