  Platform Engineer
  
  We're looking for a (Senior) Platform Engineer to own and
  evolve our infrastructure — with a focus on developer
  experience and the chance to get hands-on with AI systems.
  
  What you'll do
  
  - Design and maintain cloud infrastructure on AWS using
    Terraform
  - Own and improve CI/CD pipelines for fast, safe deployments
  - Manage and scale Kubernetes clusters
  - Improve developer experience — making it easy for teams to
    ship and debug
  - Implement monitoring, logging and alerting for full
    observability
  - Configure and optimise CDN infrastructure
  
  You are
  
  - 8-10 years of experience in DevOps, SRE or platform
    engineering roles
  - Expertise in AWS
  - Proficient with Terraform and infrastructure-as-code
    workflows
  - Experienced in building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines
    (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins or similar)
  - Solid understanding of Kubernetes — deployment, networking,
    scaling and troubleshooting
  - Strong sysadmin fundamentals — Linux, networking, storage
    and configuration management
  - Comfortable working with relational databases (PostgreSQL,
    MySQL) and time series databases (TimescaleDB, Prometheus)
  - A clear communicator who works well across engineering and
    data science teams
  - Pragmatic and reliable — you know when to move fast and when
    to be careful
  
  Nice to have
  
  - Experience supporting ML infrastructure — model deployment,
    GPU workloads or training pipelines
  - Background in CDN configuration (CloudFront, Fastly,
    Cloudflare)
  - Familiarity with streaming data or video processing systems
  - Interest in MLOps and bridging the gap between ML research
    and production
  
  Why this role matters
  
  You'll keep our systems running smoothly and help the team
  ship with confidence. And if you're curious about ML, you'll
  get real exposure to production AI systems.
