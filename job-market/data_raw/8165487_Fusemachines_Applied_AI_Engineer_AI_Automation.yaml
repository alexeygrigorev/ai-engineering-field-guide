  actively pursue the mission of democratizing AI for the
  masses by providing high-quality AI education in underserved
  communities and helping organizations achieve their full
  potential with AI. Type: Full-time Role Overview
  
  As an AI Automation Engineer, you will play a pivotal role
  in delivering high-quality, tailored AI and automation
  solutions that directly address client challenges and
  generate tangible value. You will lead technical
  implementation efforts, support ongoing engineering for
  retainer clients, and help build scalable, productized
  solutions that can be deployed across multiple clients.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Design, develop, and deploy tailored AI and automation
    solutions based on client-specific needs and objectives.
  - Translate ambiguous business problems into scalable, end-to-
    end AI workflows using Python, n8n (or similar tools),
    OpenAI APIs, and vector databases.
  - Build full end-to-end AI automations, including triggers,
    LLM logic, API calls, data storage, error handling,
    monitoring, and iteration.
  - Design and deploy AI agent systems, including multi-step
    workflows that call tools, interact with APIs, and operate
    autonomously.
  - Integrate with third-party AI tools and platforms to solve
    real-world problems such as customer service queues, phone
    routing systems, voice agents, and agent-driven workflows.
  - Act as a technical partner for retainer clients, owning
    solution delivery, refinement, and ongoing maintenance.
  - Own the deployment, iteration, and continuous improvement of
    AI agent systems across multiple client teams.
  - Create technical documentation, client demos, and internal
    playbooks to support reuse, scalability, and knowledge
    sharing.
  - Stay current on emerging AI tools, libraries, and
    methodologies to continuously improve solution quality and
    delivery speed.
  
  Success in This Role Looks Like
  
  - Solutions delivered to clients consistently meet or exceed
    expectations and show measurable business impact (e.g.,
    time saved, cost reduced, conversion increased).
  - Retainer clients view you as a go-to engineering
    partner—relying on your expertise to expand AI usage and
    optimize existing workflows.
  - You bring creativity and a strategic approach to problem
    solving and your solutions designs.
  
  Qualifications
  
  - 3 to 5+ years of experience in software engineering or
    applied systems development.
  - Demonstrated project experience building AI-driven and
    automation-based solutions using tools such as GPT APIs,
    workflow orchestration platforms, and embeddings.
  - Hands-on experience building end-to-end AI agent workflows,
    including phone trees, customer support bots, voice
    agents, or API-driven AI agents.
  - Experience with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, or
    strong interest and ability to ramp up quickly.
  - Familiarity with modern AI-native toolchains, such as n8n,
    Make, Vapi, Zapier, LangGraph, LlamaIndex Agents, OpenAI
    Assistants API, or similar platforms.
  - Strong experience with Python and related frameworks,
    including prompt engineering, RAG pipelines, and system
    integration patterns.
  - Proven ability to translate ambiguous business goals into
    autonomous AI workflows and production-ready
    implementations.
  - Experience supporting client relationships and managing
    multiple priorities in parallel.
  - Self-directed, collaborative, and comfortable balancing deep
    technical builds with fast, iterative prototyping.
  - Prior consulting experience or work in fast-paced startup
    environments is a plus
