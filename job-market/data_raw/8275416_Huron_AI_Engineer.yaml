description: |
  Huron is a global consultancy that collaborates with clients
  to drive strategic growth, ignite innovation and navigate
  constant change. Through a combination of strategy,
  expertise and creativity, we help clients accelerate
  operational, digital and cultural transformation, enabling
  the change they need to own their future.  Join our team as
  the expert you are now and create your future.
  
  We are looking for a hands-on and adaptable AI Engineer to
  join our AI practice. You’ll help design, build, and deploy
  intelligent systems that leverage a range of
  technologies—from machine learning to generative AI and
  agent-based architectures—to solve complex, real-world
  problems. This role spans the full AI solution lifecycle:
  data preparation, model development, application
  integration, and ongoing evaluation. You will collaborate
  closely with architects, and domain experts to ensure the AI
  solutions you help build are intelligent, reliable, and
  aligned with client goals. We work across industries and use
  cases, from early-stage prototypes to production-ready
  deployments, and we're continuously exploring new AI
  paradigms—including AI agents, agent orchestration layer,
  model chaining, and self-evaluating systems. If you’re
  excited by emerging AI technologies, fast-moving teams, and
  applied problem-solving, this is the role for you.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Design and develop AI-powered systems using both traditional
    ML and generative AI techniques, including prompt
    engineering, fine-tuning, and embeddings
  - Build intelligent applications and agents that can perform
    tasks autonomously or interactively, using frameworks like
    LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI or similar
  - Create modular, well-documented APIs and service components
    (e.g., using FastAPI or Flask) to enable model integration
    and consumption
  - Develop and manage data pipelines, including data
    collection, transformation, and quality assurance to
    support model training
  - Implement observability and evaluation mechanisms to monitor
    AI system behavior, including accuracy, drift,
    reliability, and task-level reasoning
  - Collaborate with software engineers, data scientists, and
    solution architects to ensure seamless design,
    development, and transition to production
  - Support rapid experimentation as well as robust deployment
    pipelines, depending on the maturity of each use case
  - Stay informed on the latest trends in GenAI, AI agents,
    orchestration protocols, and evaluation frameworks to
    continuously evolve our capabilities
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Atleast 4 years of hands-on experience in AI/ML development
    or intelligent application engineering
  - Proficiency in Python and familiarity with modern ML/AI
    libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenAI
    APIs)
  - Experience building APIs or backend services using FastAPI,
    Flask, or equivalent frameworks
  - Exposure to agent frameworks (e.g., LangGraph, AutoGen) and
    vector databases
  - Familiarity with cloud platforms (Azure, AWS) and
    containerization tools (Docker)
  - Familiarity with cloud-based ML platforms such as Azure
    Machine Learning, AWS SageMaker, or Google AI/ML services
  - Experience with MLOps pipelines, CI/CD for model delivery,
    or model monitoring is a plus
  - Familiarity with orchestration standards or tools such as
    MCP or agent routing protocols is a plus
  - Knowledge of AI system evaluation, observability, or prompt
    performance testing is a plus
  - Ability to work on cross-functional teams, balance multiple
    projects, and communicate effectively with technical and
    non-technical audiences
  - Cloud certifications in AI/ML services (Azure, AWS, or
    Google Cloud) is a plus
  - Bachelor’s degree in computer science, Engineering, Data
    Science, or a related field
