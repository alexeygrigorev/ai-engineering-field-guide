  About Pathwork
  
  Pathwork is redesigning life & health insurance jobs for the
  AI age. We believe the 2.5M professionals in the $1T life
  and health insurance industry don’t need better tools; they
  need a new operating system.
  
  We’ve already proven it:
  
  - 40+ top brokerages and national carriers use Pathwork
  - Active pilots with multiple top-10 insurance companies
  - 150%+ QoQ growth, every quarter since launch
  
  Built from day one as AI-native, Pathwork uses agentic
  orchestration, structured data pipelines, predictive models,
  and generative AI to transform insurance
  distribution—bringing speed, structure, and intelligence to
  outdated workflows.
  
  Why Join Us
  
  - Category-defining product already in use by national
    brokerages and insurers
  - $3.75M in funding from top VCs
  - Deep founder experience: Work closely with experienced
    founders who’ve built and scaled companies from zero to
    IPO in insurance and AI
  - Scenic, focused, intentional: Work from the Presidio in SF
    or our Domino Park office in Brooklyn—spaces built for
    walking meetings, deep work, and ambitious thinking.
  - Early team, deep ownership, real impact: You’ll shape the
    systems, the stack, and the trajectory of the product.
  - High-trust & Long-term oriented: Grow with a team that
    values trust, authenticity, learning, and lasting impact.
    Your contributions will help shape our product, culture,
    and the long-term legacy of the company.
  
  Our Stack
  
  Python · TypeScript · Node.js · FastAPI · Postgres · Qdrant
  · LangGraph · Whisper · AWS (Lambda, EC2, ECS, S3) ·
  Terraform · React · Next.js
  
  About the Role
  
  We’re hiring an AI engineer, a full-stack, strategic builder
  who can take a large project from a working prototype to an
  industry-defining product. You’ll lead development of our
  agentic AI systems, owning model orchestration, retrieval,
  real-time inference, evaluation, and production
  infrastructure, and collaborating closely with the founding
  team on product and technical strategy.
  
  What You’ll Own
  
  - Build the engine: Design and own end-to-end agentic
    systems—retrieval, orchestration, inference, eval, and
    feedback loops
  - Scale the stack: Shape our architecture across model
    interfaces, data pipelines, vector DBs, and streaming
    infrastructure
  - Ship fast: Partner with product and design to prototype,
    test, and launch AI-driven features that deliver real
    value
  - Improve performance: Continuously optimize accuracy,
    latency, and robustness through fine-tuning, eval
    frameworks, and data iteration
  - Learn from the field: Join sales and customer calls to
    understand real-world pain points, pressure-test features,
    and translate feedback into product improvements
  - Support growth: Build infrastructure and tools that help the
    whole company move faster—debugging, observability, agent
    testing
  - Build your team: Hire, mentor, and collaborate with
    engineers who care about craft, velocity, and real-world
    impact
  
  You Might Be a Fit If You...
  
  - Have 5–10 years of experience building AI or ML-powered
    systems, ideally in high-growth or early-stage
    environments
  - Have shipped real products that use LLMs, retrieval,
    orchestration, or streaming inference—not just prototypes
  - Think full-stack, end-to-end: You’re comfortable moving
    between modeling, infra, and product-facing code
  - Have an entrepreneurial mindset and thrive on building from
    scratch—systems, processes, tools, and the team
  - Can explain complex ideas clearly, especially to non-
    technical teammates, customers, and stakeholders
  - Thrive in ambiguity and take ownership in fast-paced, high-
    trust environments
  - Bonus: Experience with vertical software businesses or
    agentic AI systems
  
  What You’ll Get
  
  - Competitive comp + meaningful equity
  - Employee-centric benefits including:
    - High 401(k( match and FSA program
    - Modern, employer-paid health benefits designed to support
      you on your terms
  - Real ownership, autonomy, and direct collaboration with the
    founders
  - A chance to define a category and shape a product from
    scratch
  - A hybrid culture anchored in SF and NYC—4 days a week in our
    Presidio HQ or our Williamsburg office on Domino
    Park—where you'll work side-by-side with the founding
    team, shape our rituals, and help create the moments and
    memories that define our company.
