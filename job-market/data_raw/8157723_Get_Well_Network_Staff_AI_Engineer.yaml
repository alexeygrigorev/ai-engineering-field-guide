  Opportunity
  
  Get Well is seeking a highly experienced and innovative
  Staff AI Engineer to lead the architecture, development, and
  optimization of cutting-edge AI solutions across the
  organization’s healthcare platform. This role requires deep
  technical expertise in large language models (LLMs),
  multimodal AI systems, agentic frameworks, and voice
  technologies—including STT (speech-to-text) and TTS (text-
  to-speech).
  
  As a Staff-level technical leader, you will guide the AI
  engineering lifecycle from conceptualization to deployment
  at scale while serving as a key cross-functional partner to
  product, engineering, and clinical teams. This is a high-
  impact, hands-on role for a forward-thinking AI expert with
  a strong understanding of emerging agentic systems and best
  practices in safety, observability, and machine learning
  operations in regulated environments.
  
  ResponsibilitiesHealthcare-Focused AI System Design &
  Development
  
  - Architect and develop production-ready AI models trained on
    real-world clinical datasets sourced from hospital
    systems, EHRs, and patient engagement platforms.
  - Partner with clinical informatics and product teams to
    derive insights from structured and unstructured health
    data, including FHIR, HL7, CCDA, and EHR notes.
  - Design and train speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech
    (TTS) models to power voice-enabled AI applications and
    virtual assistants in a healthcare setting.
  - Integrate and optimize agentic systems using frameworks such
    as LangChain, LangGraph, or CrewAI for autonomous
    decision-making and workflow automation.
  - Drive the end-to-end development lifecycle—from data prep
    and model training to evaluation, deployment, and
    monitoring—ensuring responsiveness and efficiency in high-
    impact healthcare settings.
  - Evaluate and incorporate emerging AI technologies and
    architectural tools to improve intelligence,
    personalization, and user experience.
  
  Infrastructure Optimization & MLOps
  
  - Lead the model lifecycle from ingestion and preprocessing of
    healthcare datasets (e.g., EHR records, patient surveys,
    clinical measurements) to training, evaluation, and
    deployment into hospital IT ecosystems.
  - Lead the design and optimization of cloud-based AI
    infrastructure, focusing on scalability, performance,
    observability, and cost-efficiency (Azure preferred).
  - Establish and maintain scalable CI/CD pipelines, GPU-
    optimized runtimes, and real-time or batch inference
    systems in Azure healthcare-compliant environments.
  - Ensure reliability, production-grade observability, and
    rollback safeguards using tools like Langfuse, Prometheus,
    Grafana, and other internal tools.
  
  Monitoring, Observability & Reliability
  
  - Set up and manage observability tools and frameworks such as
    Langfuse, Prometheus, Grafana, or equivalent to monitor
    operational health of AI models and agentic workflows.
  - Establish proactive monitoring for model performance, agent
    behavior, anomaly detection, and feedback loop management.
  - Rapidly diagnose and address system bottlenecks, drift, or
    failure points in production environments.
  
  Healthcare Compliance & Responsible AI
  
  - Ensure all AI solutions adhere to HIPAA, GDPR, and internal
    privacy and data security standards.
  - Design and enforce ethical AI principles, focusing on bias
    mitigation, explainability, reproducibility, and
    accountability.
  - Oversee secure handling and governance of sensitive data,
    including ePHI and PHI, in compliance with Federal, State,
    and local regulations.
  
  Cross-Functional Collaboration & Technical Leadership
  
  - Act as a principal technical liaison between AI engineering,
    product, design, and clinical stakeholders.
  - Translate complex technical architectures into product-
    aligned features and user-centric outcomes.
  - Collaborate closely with clinical experts to ensure AI
    solutions address high-impact, evidence-based healthcare
    needs.
  - Mentor and elevate junior engineers through architecture
    reviews, hands-on pairing, and code quality leadership.
  - Drive a culture of innovation, excellence, and learning
    across AI engineering and data science teams.
  
  QualificationsEducation & Experience
  
  - Master’s or PhD in Computer Science, Artificial
    Intelligence, Machine Learning, or a closely related
    technical field.
  - 8–10+ years of hands-on experience in AI/ML development,
    with 3+ years in technical leadership or Staff/Principal-
    level roles.
  - Proven track record of delivering production-grade AI
    systems in healthcare industries.
  
  Technical Expertise
  
  - Deep expertise in:
    - LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, LLaMA, Claude) and transformer-based NLP
      models
    - Multimodal learning architectures integrating text, image,
      and structured healthcare data
    - Agentic AI systems using frameworks like CrewAI, LangChain,
      and LangGraph
    - STT/TTS models (e.g., Whisper, Tacotron, FastSpeech,
      DeepSpeech)
  - Advanced programming in Python (required); familiarity with
    C++ is a plus.
  - Proficient in AI/ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow,
    Hugging Face, and model serving stacks.
  - Hands-on experience with MLOps frameworks, infrastructure-
    as-code, container orchestration, and model registries.
  - Familiarity with healthcare data standards (FHIR, HL7,
    SNOMED, ICD-10) and clinical integration best practices
  - Awareness of cutting-edge trends in Agentic Systems,
    Multimodal Context Processing (MCP), A2A (Agent-to-Agent)
    protocols, and healthcare-centric AI safety practices.
  
  Professional Attributes
  
  - Strong analytical and problem-solving abilities with a bias
    for action.
  - Excellent communicator—able to translate complex AI systems
    to diverse stakeholders.
  - Proven ability to work in fast-paced, cross-functional, and
    agile product environments.
  - Committed to high standards of privacy, compliance, and
    ethical AI.
