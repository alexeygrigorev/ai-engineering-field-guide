  What you will do
  
  As an Integrations Engineer on the Agentic AI Platform
  Integrations team, you will act as a crucial bridge between
  our engineering teams and our customers (internal teams,
  partners and customers). Your primary focus will be to help
  customers understand and leverage our Agentic AI Platform to
  solve their specific business problems. This role requires a
  unique blend of technical expertise, problem-solving skills,
  and exceptional communication. You will work directly with
  our clients to understand their technical requirements,
  design tailored solutions, and ensure a seamless integration
  of our platform to serve their unique use cases.

  - Serve as a technical subject matter expert on the Agentic AI
    Platform for our customers and partners.
  - Educate clients on Agentic AI concepts, terminology, and
    use-case possibilities.
  - Provide expert technical guidance and support to customers
    throughout the entire integration lifecycle, from pre to
    post-integration.
  - Troubleshoot and resolve complex technical issues related to
    customer integrations and platform usage.
  
  Technical Solutions & Implementation:
  
  - Design and implement custom technical solutions by tailoring
    the Agentic AI Platform to meet customer-specific needs.
  - Develop scripts, tools, and documentation to facilitate and
    streamline the integration process.
  - Collaborate with clients' technical teams to ensure
    successful deployment and adoption of the platform.
  - Create and maintain comprehensive technical documentation,
    guides, and best practices for integration.
  
  Collaboration & Product Improvement:
  
  - Act as a key liaison between customers and our core
    engineering teams.
  - Translate customer feedback and technical challenges into
    clear, actionable requirements for platform improvements
    and new features.
  - Work closely with product managers, engineers, and
    researchers to inform the product roadmap based on real-
    world customer needs.
  - Participate actively in team meetings and knowledge sharing.
  
  What You Should Bring
  
  - Bachelor's degree (or equivalent practical experience) in
    Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field.
  - 3+ years of professional experience in a customer-facing
    technical role such as Solutions Engineer, Integrations
    Engineer, or Technical Consultant.
  - Strong proficiency in at least one modern programming
    language (e.g., Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java).
  - Solid understanding of software systems, APIs (REST, gRPC),
    and data formats (JSON, Protobuf).
  - Excellent problem-solving skills and the ability to debug
    complex technical issues.
  - Exceptional communication and interpersonal skills, with the
    ability to explain complex technical concepts to both
    technical and non-technical audiences.
  - A strong desire to help customers succeed and a passion for
    working directly with clients.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Hands-on experience with AI/ML concepts, particularly
    working with Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector
    databases.
  - Practical experience with agentic AI concepts and frameworks
    (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex).
  - Experience in developing and maintaining technical
    documentation for a developer audience.
  - Familiarity with support/bug ticketing systems (e.g., Jira).
  - Experience working in a fast-paced, startup-like
    environment.
