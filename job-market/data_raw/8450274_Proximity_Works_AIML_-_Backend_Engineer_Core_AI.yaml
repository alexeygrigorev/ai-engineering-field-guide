description: |
  We are looking for a Senior Backend Engineer to build and
  operate the core AI/ML-backed systems that power large-
  scale, consumer-facing products. You will work on
  production-grade AI runtimes, retrieval systems, and ML-
  adjacent backend infrastructure, making pragmatic tradeoffs
  across quality, latency, reliability, and cost.
  
  We are hiring applied AI engineers, not engineering-for-ML
  profiles.
  
  This role is not an entry point into AI/ML. You are expected
  to already have hands-on experience shipping ML-backed
  backend systems in production.
  
  At Proximity, you won’t just build APIs — you’ll own
  critical backend systems end-to-end, collaborate closely
  with Applied ML and Product teams, and help define the
  foundations that power intelligent experiences at scale.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Own and deliver end-to-end backend systems for AI product
    runtime, including orchestration, request lifecycle
    management, state/session handling, and policy
    enforcement.
  - Design and implement retrieval and memory primitives end-to-
    end — document ingestion, chunking strategies, embeddings
    generation, indexing, vector/hybrid search, re-ranking,
    caching, freshness, and deletion semantics.
  - Productionize ML workflows and interfaces, including feature
    and metadata services, online/offline parity, model
    integration contracts, and evaluation instrumentation.
  - Drive performance, reliability, and cost optimization,
    owning P50/P95 latency, throughput, cache hit rates, token
    and inference costs, and infrastructure efficiency.
  - Build observability by default, including structured logs,
    metrics, distributed tracing, guardrail signals, failure
    taxonomies, and reliable fallback paths.
  - Collaborate closely with Applied ML teams on model routing,
    prompt and tool schemas, evaluation datasets, and release
    safety gates.
  - Write clean, testable, and maintainable backend code,
    contributing to design reviews, code reviews, and
    operational best practices.
  - Take systems from design → build → deploy → operate,
    including on-call ownership and incident response.
  - Continuously identify bottlenecks and failure modes in AI-
    backed systems and proactively improve system robustness.
  
  Requirements
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a
    related field, or equivalent practical experience.
  
  - 6–10 years of experience building backend systems in
    production, with 2–3+ years working on ML/AI-backed
    products such as search, recommendations, ranking, RAG
    pipelines, or AI assistants.
  - Strong practical understanding of ML system fundamentals,
    including embeddings, vector similarity, reranking,
    retrieval quality, and evaluation metrics
    (precision/recall, nDCG, MRR).
  - Proven experience implementing or operating RAG pipelines,
    covering ingestion, chunking, indexing, query
    understanding, hybrid retrieval, and rerankers.
  - Solid distributed systems fundamentals, including API
    design, idempotency, concurrency, retries, circuit
    breakers, rate limiting, and multi-tenant reliability.
  - Experience with common ML/AI platform components, such as
    feature stores, metadata systems, streaming or batch
    pipelines, offline evaluation jobs, and A/B measurement
    hooks.
  - Strong proficiency in backend programming languages and
    frameworks and API development.
  
  What matters (non-negotiable):
  
  - Has built AI applications end-to-end, not just pipelines
    (RAG systems, agentic workflows, chatbots, internal AI
    tools).
  - Deep understanding of retrieval including chunking
    strategies, Embeddings, indexing & re-ranking, retrieval
    failures & tuning
  - Has owned full RAG pipelines: ingestion → chunking →
    indexing → retrieval → generation
  - Experience with agentic frameworks (tool calling, Memory,
    multi-step reasoning)
  - Thinks in terms of intelligence delivery
  - Production mindset ( evals, guardrails, latency / cost
    trade-offs)
  - Clear understanding of Managed AI Services (fallback
    mechanisms, service reliability & failure handling)
  - Clear understanding of MCPs (Model Control / Management
    Plans)
  
  Desired Skills
  
  - Experience with agentic runtimes, including tool-calling or
    function-calling patterns, structured outputs, and
    production guardrails.
  - Hands-on exposure to vector and hybrid retrieval stacks such
    as FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone, or Elasticsearch.
  - Experience running systems on Kubernetes, with strong
    knowledge of observability stacks like OpenTelemetry,
    Prometheus, Grafana, and distributed tracing.
  - Familiarity with privacy, security, and data governance
    considerations for user and model data.
  - Expected exposure of Python, LangChain / LangGraph, Vector
    DBs, LLM APIs, GCP tooling (plus, not mandatory)
  - Candidate must
  
  Benefits
  
  - Best in class compensation: We hire only the best, and we
    pay accordingly.
  - Proximity Talks: Learn from experienced engineers,
    designers, and product leaders across the organization.
  
  - Work with a world-class team: Build scalable mobile
    products, push technical boundaries, and learn something
    new every day.
