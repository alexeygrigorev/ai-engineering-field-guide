description: |
  NVIDIA has continuously reinvented itself for over two
  decades. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth
  of the PC gaming market, redefined modern computer graphics,
  and revolutionized parallel computing. More recently, GPU
  deep learning ignited modern AI - the new era of computing,
  positioning GPUs as the driving force behind intelligent
  applications in productivity, gaming, and creative fields,
  solidifying NVIDIA's position as the leading "AI computing
  company."
  
  There is a growing emphasis on processing AI computations at
  the edge, closer to the source of data. This approach
  reduces latency, improves real-time processing, and
  addresses privacy concerns by minimizing the need for data
  sending to centralized servers. As technology continues to
  advance, we can expect client-side AI (local execution) to
  play a pivotal role in crafting the digital landscape. WinAI
  seeks a Senior Systems Software Engineer interested in
  solving client-side AI challenges on Windows PCs with
  limited resources.
  
  What You’ll Be Doing:
  
  - Partnering with NVIDIA software, research, architecture, and
    product teams to align strategies and technical needs for
    encouraging the ecosystem of AI on Windows RTX PCs.
  - Collaborate closely with Microsoft to advance AI across
    critical domains—including graphics, web browsers, and
    edge devices—by driving innovation in technologies such as
    WindowsML, ONNX Runtime, and NVIDIA’s proprietary
    libraries and driver stack.
  - Improving performance on current and next-generation GPU
    architectures by conducting in-depth analysis and end-to-
    end optimization of AI models, data processing pipelines,
    and inference runtime features.
  - Identifying, evaluating, and implementing compute and memory
    optimization techniques—such as quantization,
    distillation, and pruning—for large AI models; fine-tuning
    and compressing models to fit edge devices.
  
  What We Need to See:
  
  - Bachelor's, Master's, or PhD in Computer Science, Software
    Engineering, Mathematics, or a related field (or
    equivalent experience).
  - Excellent C++ programming and debugging skills with a strong
    understanding of data structures and algorithms.
  - 5+ years of experience with proficiency in AI inferencing
    pipelines and applications using ML/DL frameworks like
    ONNX RT, DirectML, PyTorch, Tensor RT.
  - Strong analytical and problem-solving abilities, with the
    ability to multitask effectively in a dynamic environment.
  - Outstanding written and oral communication skills enabling
    effective collaboration with management and engineering
    teams.
  
  Ways To Stand Out from The Crowd:
  
  - Understanding modern techniques in Machine Learning, Deep
    Neural Networks, and Generative AI with relevant
    contributions to major open-source projects will be a
    plus.
  - Consistent track record of delivering end-to-end products
    with geographically distributed teams in multinational
    product companies.
  - Proficiency in lower-level system/GPU programming, CUDA,
    developing high-performance systems.
  - Hands-on experience with building applications using APIs
    like ONNX RT, DirectML, DirectX, PyTorch, TensorRT,
    Vulkan.
