  Mission
  
  Architect the company’s proprietary “SaaS‑Killer” Agentic AI
  Stack—the intellectual backbone that will replace external
  platforms and secure our long-term technology sovereignty.
  
  1. The “Total Replacement” Roadmap
  
  I. Agentic Claims Adjudication (SaaS Replacement)
  
  Objective: Build an in-house, AI-native Claims Management
  System to replace third‑party CMS platforms. Execution:
  
  - Design backend pipelines to ingest and validate medical data
    via NHCX.
  - Automate clinical scrutiny and rule-based adjudication using
    agentic workflows.Outcome:
  - Straight-Through Processing (STP) with near-zero manual
    intervention.
  - Decommissioning of legacy SaaS workbenches.
  
  II. Predictive FWA & Real-Time Risk Sovereignty
  
  Objective: Replace external Fraud, Waste & Abuse (FWA)
  platforms with an in-house predictive risk engine.
  Execution:
  
  - Build scoring models for every pre-auth and claim using
    proprietary fraud signatures.
  - Develop a real-time “risk brain” that analyzes patterns at
    the point of care.Outcome:
  - A live Provider Trust Score that auto-triggers approvals or
    investigations.
  - Zero dependency on third-party FWA suites
  
  III. Autonomous Provider Network & Portal
  
  Objective: Build a proprietary “Network Control Tower” as a
  replacement for external hospital portals and network tools.
  Execution:
  
  - Architect secure, bidirectional data interoperability using
    HL7 FHIR and ABDM standards.
  - Enable automated onboarding, tariff updates, and network
    insights.Outcome:
  - Dynamic package pricing, automated negotiations, and self-
    updating network data—powered by agentic backends.
  
  
  
  2. Requirements & Qualifications
  
  Core Engineering (Must Have)
  
  - 6+ years of experience in high-scale backend engineering
    using Python, Go, or Java.
  - Proven ability to build robust, scalable distributed
    systems.
  
  The “Builder” DNA (Must Have)
  
  - Demonstrated history of building systems from scratch—not
    just configuring SaaS tools.
  - Comfort owning architecture end-to-end with minimal external
    dependencies.
  
  AI/ML (Preferred)
  
  - Experience deploying AI models or ML-backed workflows is
    beneficial.
  - Strong mathematical and logical grounding to quickly adopt:
    - Vertex AI
    - Gemini models
    - Agentic frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI)
  
  GCP Readiness
  
  - Willingness to become proficient with:
    - Vertex AI
    - BigQuery ML
    - Document AI
    - Cloud-native microservices & orchestration
  
  Interoperability Enthusiasm
  
  - Interest in mastering the evolving healthcare standards:
  - National Health Claims Exchange (NHCX)
    - ABDM protocols
    - FHIR-based data flows
  
  3. Why This Role?
  
  Technology Sovereignty
  
  You will lead the build-out of platforms that replace multi-
  crore SaaS tools and define the company’s technological
  autonomy.
  
  Deep IP Ownership
  
  Every module built reduces reliance on third-party vendors
  and directly increases company valuation.
  
  Direct Leadership Access
  
  Work hands-on with the CTIO and business heads at the Mumbai
  HQ.
  
  Candidate Profile
  
  The ideal candidate is a senior backend engineer who:
  
  - Wants to transition into Agentic AI leadership.
  - Believes the “UPI moment” for insurance (NHCX) demands a
    fully custom, AI-native architecture.
  - Has a strong bias for first-principles design and building
    proprietary systems over vendor customization.
  
  The initial technical interview will focus on:
  
  - Your most complex build-from-scratch backend project.
  - You're thinking around architectural sovereignty and system
    ownership.
