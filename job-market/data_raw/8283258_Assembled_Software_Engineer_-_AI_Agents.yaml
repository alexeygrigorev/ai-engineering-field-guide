  About Assembled
  
  Great customer support requires human agents and AI in
  perfect balance, and Assembled is the only unified platform
  that orchestrates both at scale. Companies like Canva, Etsy,
  and Robinhood use Assembled to coordinate their entire
  support operation — in-house agents, BPOs, and AI — in a
  single operating system. With AI Agents that resolve cases
  end-to-end, AI Copilot for agent assistance, and AI-powered
  workforce management that optimizes both human and AI
  capacity, Assembled helps teams deliver faster, better
  service while making smarter decisions about how to staff
  and automate. Backed by $70M from NEA, Emergence Capital,
  and Stripe, we're building the platform that makes AI and
  human collaboration actually work.
  
  The Team
  
  Our AI Products Team is building autonomous AI agents that
  handle the most challenging aspects of customer support and
  let human agents focus on high-value interactions. After
  launching the product's go-to-market motion, the Assist
  product line grew 5x in just 3 months to millions of ARR,
  with a strong pipeline of deals for even more growth.
  
  We're already deploying our systems at leading tech
  companies like Canva, Patreon, and Babylist, giving us
  complex real-world scenarios to solve with rapid feedback
  loops. The engineering challenges are significant: building
  autonomous agents that can reliably handle customer
  interactions, designing systems that scale across
  communication channels, and pushing the boundaries of what's
  possible with current LLM technology.
  
  Operating as an team led by CTO John Wang, we're focused on
  eliminating low-leverage support work and helping agents
  send faster, more accurate replies.
  
  Examples of what you might work on:
  
  - Scaling LLMs with Golang
  - Enhancing RAG results with Reciprocal Rank Fusion and Hybrid
    Search
  - Pioneering new LLM evaluation techniques
  
  Responsibilities
  
  As a Software Engineer on the AI Products Team, you will:
  
  - Build foundational new features: Develop product features
    from the ground up, such as implementing translation
    capabilities powered by LLMs and intelligent
    categorization of incoming tickets. You’ll help design and
    build a workflow builder that distills the complexity of
    workflows into a simple, intuitive interface, making
    powerful tools accessible and easy to use for support
    agents.
  - Improve LLM model results: Enhance our retrieval augmented
    generation engine using techniques like vector search,
    document re-ranking, and hypothetical document embeddings.
    You’ll help us leverage implicit knowledge bases like past
    tickets and macros to improve model performance.
  - Develop LLM Infrastructure: Architect the abstractions that
    enable the integration of various types of LLMs tailored
    for different applications. You’ll design and implement
    evaluation and logging systems to monitor performance and
    build interfaces that expand our platform's capabilities.
  - Engage with customers: Collaborate with our customers (both
    support agents and managers) to understand their needs,
    how they interact with our product, and how we can improve
    their lives.
  - Wear many hats: Be versatile in roles — coding, user
    research, planning, brainstorming, interviewing, and
    cross-team collaboration.
  - Shape the team culture: Encourage a startup mentality that’s
    all about staying positive, aiming for top-notch product
    quality, and taking initiative.
