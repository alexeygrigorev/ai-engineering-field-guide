  About the Role
  
  A1 is building a proactive AI system that users rely on
  daily across conversations, tools, and workflows.
  
  You will define how AI feels in users’ hands. This role
  focuses on building production-quality iOS applications
  where AI is a core interaction layer, not an add-on. Your
  work will directly impact usability, trust, and perceived
  intelligence of the product.
  
  Focus
  
  - Build and maintain iOS applications using Swift and SwiftUI.
  - Integrate AI-powered features through backend APIs.
  - Design UX patterns for AI interactions, including loading
    states, streaming responses, retries, and fallbacks.
  - Optimize performance, memory usage, and battery efficiency.
  - Capture user signals and feedback to support AI evaluation
    and iteration.
  - Collaborate closely with backend and ML engineers on API
    design and system behavior.
  - Maintain high App Store quality, stability, and production
    reliability.
  
  Ideal Experiences
  
  - 3+ years of iOS development experience using Swift.
  - Hands-on experience integrating AI-powered features into
    mobile apps.
  - Strong understanding of async/await, concurrency, and
    background tasks.
  - Solid iOS performance and memory optimization skills.
  - Experience shipping and maintaining production iOS apps.
  - Comfort designing for latency, partial failure, and non-
    deterministic AI behavior.
  - Exposure to CoreML or light on-device ML.
  - Familiarity with feature flags or remote configuration
    systems.
  - Strong intuition for AI UX patterns and user trust
    considerations.
  
  Tech Stack
  
  - Swift
  - SPM
  - SwiftUI
  - SQL / noSQL
  - TensorFlow Lite (on-device inference)
  
  How We Work
  
  Our organization is very flat and our team is small, highly
  motivated, and focused on engineering and product
  excellence. All members are expected to be hands-on and to
  contribute directly to the company’s mission.
  
  Interview process
  
  If there appears to be a fit, we'll reach to schedule 3, but
  no more than 4 interviews.
  
  Applications are evaluated by our technical team members.
  Interviews will be conducted via virtual meetings and/or
  onsite.
  
  We value transparency and efficiency, so expect a prompt
  decision. If you've demonstrated the exceptional skills and
  mindset we're looking for, we'll extend an offer to join us.
  This isn't just a job offer; it's an invitation to be part
  of a team that's bringing AI to have practical benefits to
  billions globally.
