title: Staff Platform Engineer, AI
company: True Anomaly
location: 
work_type: FULL_TIME
level: Expert/Leader
description: |
  A new space race has begun. True Anomaly seeks those with
  the talent and ambition to build innovative technology that
  solves the next generation of engineering, manufacturing,
  and operational challenges for space security and
  sustainability.
  
  OUR MISSION
  
  The peaceful use of space is essential for continued
  prosperity on Earth—from communications and finance to
  navigation and logistics. True Anomaly builds innovative
  technology at the intersection of spacecraft, software, and
  AI to enhance the capabilities of the U.S., its allies, and
  commercial partners. We safeguard global security by
  ensuring space access and sustainability for all.
  
  OUR VALUES
  
  - Be the offset. We create asymmetric advantages with
    creativity and ingenuity
  - What would it take? We challenge assumptions to deliver
    ambitious results
  - It’s the people. Our team is our competitive advantage and
    we are better together
  
  YOUR MISSION
  
  AI-assisted work is the biggest force multiplier available
  to a company at True Anomaly's stage. It accelerates how we
  build, how we deliver, and how we scale. We are investing in
  AI as a core operating capability, not a side experiment,
  and this role exists to make that investment real.
  
  As a Staff AI Platform Engineer, you will be one of the
  first hires to build the infrastructure, tooling, and
  integrations that put AI directly into the hands and
  workflows of every team across the company. This is not a
  research role. It is a building role. You will ship
  capabilities that engineers, program managers, operators,
  and business teams use every day to move faster and produce
  better work.
  
  The scope is broad by design. You may be standing up on-
  premises GPU infrastructure one week, building connectors
  between AI models and internal systems the next, and
  developing a custom application for a specific business
  workflow after that. You will make platform-level technical
  decisions about which AI providers, tools, and architectures
  to adopt. You will also own AI training and enablement for
  the company, running office hours, brown bags, and building
  the resources that help people get real value from these
  tools.
  
  This role reports to the Chief Security Officer and works
  across every function. You will have significant autonomy,
  direct access to executive leadership, and the opportunity
  to define how a fast-growing defense technology company
  operates with AI.
  
  RESPONSIBILITIES
  
  - Build and maintain AI platform infrastructure: API
    integrations, model access pipelines, system connectors
    (MCP, tool use), and on-premises compute environments as
    needed
  - Develop custom AI-powered applications, workflows, and
    integrations that connect frontier models to internal
    systems such as project management, documentation,
    communications, and operational tools
  - Own technical evaluation and selection of AI providers,
    tools, and platforms, making build-vs-buy decisions based
    on capability, compliance requirements, and speed to value
  - Design and deliver AI training and enablement programs for
    the company, including hands-on workshops, office hours,
    documentation, and shared resources that help teams build
    real fluency
  - Partner with engineering, security, and IT teams to ensure
    AI deployments meet government security and compliance
    requirements across data classification levels
  - Stay current with the rapidly evolving AI landscape and
    bring informed recommendations on new models, tools, and
    capabilities that could accelerate the company
  
  QUALIFICATIONS
  
  - Strong software engineering background with experience
    building and shipping production systems, ideally in
    Python, TypeScript, or similar languages common in AI/ML
    tooling
  - Hands-on experience with large language model APIs,
    including prompt engineering, tool use, retrieval-
    augmented generation (RAG), and agent frameworks
  - Experience building integrations between AI systems and
    enterprise platforms (APIs, webhooks, data pipelines,
    authentication flows)
  - Demonstrated ability to work across a broad technical
    surface area, context-switching between infrastructure,
    application development, and platform architecture
  - Strong communication skills and ability to translate
    technical AI concepts for non-technical audiences through
    training, documentation, and direct support
  - Self-directed and comfortable operating with high autonomy
    in a fast-paced environment where priorities shift and the
    playbook is being written in real time
  - Ability to maintain or obtain TS//SCI clearance
  
  PREFERRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE
  
  - Experience deploying AI or ML systems in government,
    defense, or regulated environments with security and
    compliance constraints
  - Familiarity with government cloud environments (AWS
    GovCloud, Azure Government) and authorization frameworks
    (FedRAMP, IL4/IL5)
  - Experience with on-premises GPU infrastructure (NVIDIA,
    CUDA) for model hosting or fine-tuning
  - Background in developer tooling, platform engineering, or
    internal tools teams at high-growth technology companies
  - Experience building knowledge retrieval systems, embedding
    pipelines, or enterprise search infrastructure
  - Currently hold or have previously held a U.S. security
    clearance at any level
  
  COMPENSATION
  
  - Base Salary: $175,000 - $250,000
  - Equity + Benefits including Health, Dental, Vision, HRA/HSA
    options, PTO and paid holidays, 401K, Parental Leave
  
  Your actual level and base salary will be determined on a
  case-by-case basis and may vary based on the following
  considerations: job-related knowledge and skills, education,
  location, and experience.
