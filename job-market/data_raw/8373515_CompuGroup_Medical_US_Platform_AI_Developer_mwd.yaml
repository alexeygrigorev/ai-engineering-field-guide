  Job Description
  
  As a leading company in the field of software solutions for
  healthcare, we operate in 19 countries and employ over 9,000
  dedicated staff members. You will work in a dynamic and
  innovative environment full of opportunities. With your
  commitment and passion, you have the chance to make a
  lasting difference.
  
  Together, we are shaping the healthcare system of the
  future. Become part of our mission and make a difference—for
  a world where knowledge saves lives!
  
  Your Impact
  
  - Development and operation of a microservice-based agent mesh
    – highly scalable, multi-tenant, and secure by design.
  - Orchestration of agentic systems and multi-agent
    architectures with frameworks such as LangChain, CrewAI,
    or Semantic Kernel.
  - Integration and productive deployment of foundation models
    (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face, Mistral).
  - Design and implementation of intelligent backend components
    for context management, Retrieval-Augmented Generation
    (RAG), memory, tool use, and agentic collaboration.
  - Building pipelines for prompt optimization, inference
    control, and usage analytics.
  - Close collaboration with frontend, UX, and infrastructure
    teams to bring AI solutions into end-to-end production.
  
  Your Profile
  
  - Degree in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data
    Science, or a comparable discipline.
  - Hands-on experience in developing LLM-powered agentic
    applications with a strong focus on microservice
    architectures.
  - Deep expertise in Python (LangChain, FastAPI, AsyncIO,
    Pydantic), as well as in working with model APIs, data
    integration, and CI/CD.
  - Experience with Azure AI, Azure ML, or comparable cloud
    stacks (GCP, AWS is a plus).
  - Knowledge of vector databases (e.g., Qdrant, Weaviate,
    Pinecone, FAISS) and the application of embedding models
    for RAG approaches.
  - Solid understanding of scalability, multi-tenancy, and
    security requirements in the productive operation of AI
    systems.
