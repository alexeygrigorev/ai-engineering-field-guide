  About Us
  
  Temporal is an open source programming model that can
  simplify code, make applications more reliable, and help
  developers focus on the important things like delivering
  features faster. We are on a mission to be the reliable
  foundation of every developer’s toolbox, and are building
  the team that will make that happen.
  
  
  
  Our values guide us —they are present in how we show up,
  make decisions, and work together to make an impact. We’re
  curious, driven, collaborative, genuine and humble.
  
  
  
  Temporal is growing and we are looking for those who share
  our values, challenge 'standard' thinking, and want to
  influence our future. If you have a passion for improving
  the developer experience, building world-class open-source
  software and communities, and want to be a part of our
  amazing team, we'd love to hear from you!
  
  Summary
  
  We have an opening to hire a Staff Software Engineer - AI
  SDK.
  
  Temporal provides durable execution, the systems foundation
  used for reliable AI at leaders such as OpenAI, Lovable,
  Replit, and many others. As a member of the AI SDK team, you
  will be creating building blocks to support the expanding
  ecosystem of AI applications.
  
  Under the hood, non-trivial AI applications quickly become
  distributed systems. Fault tolerance and other challenges
  quickly become evident in tasks requiring reasoning, tool
  calls, memory management, human-in-the loop interactivity,
  and ambient or background processing. Temporal removes the
  complexity otherwise inherent in such applications, allowing
  simple code that works as intended every time.
  
  The AI SDK team is pushing to keep Temporal at the forefront
  of AI applications. Because the landscape is constantly
  changing, we engage heavily in prototyping to ensure that
  the abstractions we develop meet the needs of emerging
  applications. We also ensure that Temporal integrates well
  with leading AI frameworks and libraries.
  
  Most of Temporal’s work is open source—see for yourself
  here: https://github.com/temporalio [new window]
  
  What You Will Do
  
  - Work as a Software Engineer.
  - Design and implement Temporal AI SDK features supporting a
    broad variety of frameworks and libraries.
  - Develop a deep understanding of AI application development
    techniques, including emerging approaches and
    architectures.
  - Work with multiple programming languages, primarily Python
    and TypeScript.
  - Make extensive use of AI coding tools, especially to ensure
    quality across a large number of integrations.
  - Take end-to-end ownership of new features, working with
    other teams to deliver exceptional reliability and a great
    developer experience.
  - Serve as a domain expert on AI design patterns,
    collaborating with field staff to provide best-practices
    and canonical examples.
  - Work directly with our developer community to debug issues
    that need expert attention, and get feedback on Temporal
    SDK features and APIs.
  - Write public technical documentation describing Temporal
    concepts and APIs.
  - Go the extra mile to support a customer in need, on the rare
    occasion that AI SDK engineering expertise is needed.
  - Travel to meet your coworkers for a week once or twice a
    year.
  - Attend the occasional developer conference to talk about how
    great Temporal is (optional).
  
  What You Won’t Do
  
  - Work as a Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Devops SWE, or SRE.
  - Work in an office (unless you want to, but you’d be by
    yourself). Temporal is a fully-remote company.
  - Commit code that’s poorly-tested or works “most of the
    time”. Temporal aspires to be “Reliable as Gravity”, and
    we expect our code to be the same.
  - Work behind closed doors. The SDKs are open source—that
    means PRs and comments are open to the public, too.
  - Sit in meetings all day. We mostly communicate in writing,
    and use meetings mainly for status updates and thorny
    issues that need input from the whole group.
  - Wake up to pager alerts. We’re extremely active in
    supporting our customers and the community, but we don’t
    do 24/7 on-call.
  
  What You’ll Bring
  
  - Experience and passion for harnessing generative AI,
    particularly for agents and coding.
  - A deep understanding of how to use AI to increase quality,
    not only to increase quantity.
  - A sense of taste in code and software development practice.
    Your approach should be opinionated and thoughtful, but
    not dogmatic.
  - A track record of open source software contributions,
    including contributions to 3rd party libraries.
  - Fluency in multiple programming languages, and an affinity
    for learning new ones.
  - Deep experience with concurrent programming—you should know
    how to use mutexes, atomics, and other concurrency
    primitives safely.
  - Experience designing APIs and writing documentation for
    publicly-available libraries or modules.
  - Strong technical communication skills—written and verbal—in
    English.
  - BS or MS in Computer Science (or a closely-related degree),
    or equivalent work experience writing production-grade
    software.
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Familiarity with Temporal’s programming model (e.g. you’ve
    written an app on Temporal).
  - Expedite building agents or other AI applications
  - Background in machine learning, model training, data
    science, or machine learning systems.
  - Experience contributing to the architecture and design of
    large-scale distributed systems.
  - Graduate degree in Computer Science.
  
  Compensation
  
  - The estimated pay range for this role is $196,000 -
    $245,000.
  - Additionally, this role is eligible to participate in
    Temporal's equity plan.
  
  Compensation ranges reflect salary and commission
  compensation (when applicable) across several geographic
  markets. Employment offers carefully consider multiple
  factors, including prior experience, knowledge, expertise,
  skillset, market location, and job level assessed during the
  interview process.
