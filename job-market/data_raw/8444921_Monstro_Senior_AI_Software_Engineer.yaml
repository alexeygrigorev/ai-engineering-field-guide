  About Monstro
  
  Monstro is the operating system for governed financial
  intelligence. We build governance and intelligence
  infrastructure that enables artificial intelligence to
  operate safely, explainably, and at institutional scale.
  
  We exist because the level of financial guidance
  historically available to a small group should be accessible
  to many more people. By combining AI with deep institutional
  infrastructure, we help financial institutions deliver more
  personalized, responsible, and life-changing financial
  support to millions of individuals.
  
  We’re building mission-critical systems in a highly
  regulated domain, and we care deeply about doing it right.
  If you’re motivated by meaningful problems, high standards,
  and shaping infrastructure that improves financial outcomes,
  you’ll feel at home here.
  
  About the Role
  
  We're looking for a Senior AI Engineer who is, first and
  foremost, a strong software engineer—someone who writes
  clean, well-tested, production-grade code and brings the
  same engineering rigor you'd expect from any senior engineer
  on our team. On top of that foundation, you'll bring deep
  expertise in AI systems: building agentic workflows,
  deploying both commercial and open-source models, and
  designing intelligent features that work reliably at scale.
  
  You'll build the AI-powered capabilities at the core of our
  platform—systems that can reason, plan, and act on behalf of
  users while remaining trustworthy, explainable, and aligned
  with user intent. Because we deploy within our partners'
  infrastructure, you'll work with both commercial model APIs
  (such as Anthropic's Claude) and self-hosted open-weight
  models, choosing the right tool for each use case based on
  performance, cost, security, and deployment constraints.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  Build Production Software
  
  Write clean, maintainable, well-tested code. Design APIs,
  services, and data models with the same rigor expected of
  any senior engineer. Participate in code reviews, contribute
  to architecture decisions, and uphold engineering best
  practices across the codebase. You'll own features end-to-
  end—from design through deployment and monitoring.
  
  Design and Build Agentic AI Systems
  
  Design and implement autonomous AI agents with planning,
  memory, and tool-use capabilities. Build orchestration
  layers that coordinate multi-step agent workflows, manage
  conversational context, and handle fallback behaviors
  gracefully. Integrate both commercial model APIs and self-
  hosted open-weight models depending on the requirements of
  each use case.
  
  Deploy and Operate AI Models
  
  Deploy and manage self-hosted open-weight LLMs within secure
  cloud environments. Optimize inference performance through
  quantization, batching strategies, and efficient serving
  frameworks (vLLM, TGI, or similar). Integrate commercial
  model APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) where appropriate,
  managing cost, latency, and reliability. Build systems that
  can operate in environments with limited or no external
  network access.
  
  Build RAG & Knowledge Systems
  
  Design retrieval-augmented generation pipelines that ground
  AI responses in authoritative, up-to-date information.
  Develop chunking, indexing, and retrieval strategies
  optimized for financial content. Integrate AI systems with
  structured knowledge bases and real-time data sources.
  
  Ensure AI Quality and Safety
  
  Develop evaluation frameworks that measure reliability,
  consistency, and safety—not just accuracy. Build automated
  testing pipelines for AI systems, including regression
  testing, adversarial testing, and edge case detection.
  Implement guardrails that prevent harmful, biased, or off-
  topic outputs. Design transparency mechanisms and audit
  trails that support compliance and debugging.
  
  Adapt and Fine-Tune Models
  
  Adapt open-weight foundation models for domain-specific
  tasks using techniques like instruction tuning, LoRA, QLoRA,
  and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Implement prompt
  engineering strategies and evaluate their effectiveness.
  Optimize model performance for latency, cost, and quality
  tradeoffs.
  
  Monitor and Improve Production AI
  
  Implement monitoring for model drift, latency, error rates,
  and output quality. Design for graceful degradation when
  models or services underperform. Create feedback loops that
  surface production issues and drive continuous improvement.
  Collaborate with Data Engineers and ML Engineers to ensure
  seamless integration with data pipelines and feature stores.
  
  Mentor and Collaborate
  
  Mentor junior engineers on AI development and software
  engineering best practices. Collaborate with product
  managers and domain experts to translate business needs into
  AI capabilities. Communicate complex AI concepts clearly to
  technical and non-technical stakeholders.
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  Core Engineering Experience
  
  - 7+ years of software engineering experience, with a track
    record of shipping production systems
  - Strong proficiency in Python and/or Go, with clean, well-
    structured code
  - Solid understanding of software engineering fundamentals:
    system design, API design, testing, code review, CI/CD,
    and version control
  - Experience with containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) and
    cloud infrastructure
  - Comfort owning features end-to-end, from design through
    deployment and observability
  
  AI & ML Expertise
  
  - 3+ years of hands-on experience building AI/ML-powered
    features or products
  - Experience building agentic AI systems—chat interfaces,
    multi-step workflows, tool-use patterns, and orchestration
    frameworks (LangChain, LangGraph, or similar)
  - Working experience with both commercial LLM APIs (Anthropic,
    OpenAI) and open-weight models (LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen, or
    similar)
  - Experience designing and implementing RAG pipelines with
    vector databases
  - Strong understanding of prompt engineering and LLM behavior
    optimization
  - Familiarity with model serving frameworks (vLLM, TGI,
    Triton, or similar) and inference optimization techniques
  - Experience with model adaptation techniques (LoRA, QLoRA,
    PEFT, instruction tuning)
  - Experience building evaluation and testing frameworks for AI
    systems
  
  Mindset & Approach
  
  - A problem solver at heart—you dig into complex problems,
    explore options, and find practical solutions rather than
    waiting for direction
  - Proactive and self-driven; you identify opportunities and
    risks before they become blockers
  - Innovative and curious; you keep up with a fast-moving field
    and bring new ideas to the team
  - Passionate about building AI systems that are both powerful
    and trustworthy
  - Excellent communicator who can explain AI behavior and
    limitations clearly to any audience
  
  Why Monstro?
  
  - Ownership & Impact: Shape the future of AI-powered
    finance—building a category-defining product used by
    consumers and institutions around the world.
  - Elite Team: Join a team with leadership that has a track
    record of scaling companies from early stage to major
    exits.
  - Principles-Driven Culture: Work in a culture that values
    speed, ownership, and impact—what most companies achieve
    in 90 days, we do in 45.
  - Comprehensive Compensation Package: Competitive salary,
    equity, and robust benefits package, including paid
    health, vision, dental, and disability coverage.
  
  Note: This role will be hybrid in office for those in the
  NYC metro or remote for those in the Denver metro area (but
  with the expectation of periodic travel to our NYC office)
  
  Base Compensation Range (New York City): $189,000 - $235,000
  Base Compensation Range (Denver Metro): $166,000 - $207,000
  
  *The posted range reflects the base salary for this role
  across the market ranges for each location. Final
  compensation will depend on a variety of factors, including
  experience, skills, internal leveling, and market
  conditions, and will be offered within the stated range in
  accordance with applicable pay transparency laws.
