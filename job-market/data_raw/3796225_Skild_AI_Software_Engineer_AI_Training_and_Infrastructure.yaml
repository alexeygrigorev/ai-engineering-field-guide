  Company Overview
  
  At Skild AI, we are building the world's first general
  purpose robotic intelligence that is robust and adapts to
  unseen scenarios without failing. We believe massive scale
  through data-driven machine learning is the key to unlocking
  these capabilities for the widespread deployment of robots
  within society. Our team consists of individuals with
  varying levels of experience and backgrounds, from new
  graduates to domain experts. Relevant industry experience is
  important, but ultimately less so than your demonstrated
  abilities and attitude. We are looking for passionate
  individuals who are eager to explore uncharted waters and
  contribute to our innovative projects.
  
  Position Overview
  
  We are looking for a Software Engineer to work at the
  forefront of developing and optimizing the software
  infrastructure and tools necessary for training cutting-edge
  AI models. You will focus on building robust, scalable, and
  efficient training pipelines and frameworks that support the
  entire machine learning lifecycle, from data preparation to
  model deployment. You will collaborate with researchers and
  machine learning engineers to ensure seamless integration
  and operation of training systems, pushing the boundaries of
  what AI can achieve in real-world robotics applications. You
  will explore new ways to efficiently make use of many types
  of data in our training pipeline.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Develop and maintain robust, scalable, and distributed
    training pipelines (data preprocessing, training
    orchestration, and model evaluation) and frameworks for
    large-scale AI models.
  - Optimize training processes for performance and resource
    utilization, ensuring scalability and reliability.
  - Collaborate with researchers and machine learning engineers
    to integrate state-of-the-art algorithms and techniques
    into training pipelines.
  - Monitor and analyze training, identifying bottlenecks and
    proposing solutions to improve efficiency and performance.
  - Ensure the robustness and reliability of the training
    infrastructure, including automated testing and continuous
    integration.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - BS, MS or higher degree in Computer Science, Robotics,
    Engineering or a related field, or equivalent practical
    experience.
  - Minimum of 3 years of industry experience.
  - Proficiency in Python, C++, or similar and at least one deep
    learning library such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, etc.
  - Strong background in distributed computing, parallel
    processing techniques, handling large-scale datasets and
    data preprocessing.
  - Deep understanding of state-of-the-art machine learning
    techniques and models.
  - Experience with cloud-based training environments (AWS,
    Google Cloud, Azure).
  - Experience in developing and maintaining software tooling
    and infrastructure for machine learning.
  - Deep understanding and practical experience with software
    engineering principles, including algorithms, data
    structures, and system design.
  - Experience with continuous integration and automated testing
    frameworks.
