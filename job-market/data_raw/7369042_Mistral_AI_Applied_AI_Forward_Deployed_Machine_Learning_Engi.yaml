  How We Work in Applied AI
  
  - We care about people and outputs.
  
  - What matters is what you ship, not the time you spend on it
  
  - Bureaucracy is where urgency goes to vanish. You talk to
    whoever you need to talk to. The best idea wins, whether
    it comes from a principal engineer or someone in their
    first week.
  
  - Always ask why. The best solutions come from deep
    understanding, not from copying what worked before
  
  - We say what we mean. Feedback is direct, timely, and given
    because we care.
  
  - No politics. Low ego, high standards.
  
  - We embrace an unstructured environment and find joy in it.
