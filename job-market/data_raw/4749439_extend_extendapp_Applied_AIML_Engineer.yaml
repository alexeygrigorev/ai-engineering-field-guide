description: |
  Extend is building a modern document processing platform,
  reimagined with LLMs. We're on a mission to transform how
  the world works with unstructured data.
  
  As an AI Engineer at Extend, you’ll be responsible for
  building state-of-the-art document processing infrastructure
  and applied AI product features. The work you do will impact
  every single customer across the millions of documents that
  our system ingests and processes every month.
  
  We’re looking to hire engineers who think creatively about
  problems, keep up to date on the latest in AI research, push
  for real-world customer impact (not only theory), and are
  excited about helping businesses tackle one of their most
  painful problems with AI.
  
  Why you should consider joining
  
  - We've grown revenue 400% last year to several million ARR,
    with our growth continuing to accelerate
  - We have a product loved by users and being used in mission-
    critical flows at enterprises (Square, Zillow, Chime) and
    startups (Brex, Mercury, Checkr), and many more
  - The market for document processing has expanded 1000x due to
    LLMs, and all existing solutions are low NPS
  - We're punching well above our weight, supporting customer
    and revenue metrics with half the team size of other
    startups — everyone joining at this stage will have
    outsized impact
  - We've raised our series A & de-risked the business, but
    there's tremendous upside ahead; now's the perfect time to
    join.
  - You'll be joining a talent dense team (e.g. former founders,
    world record holders) operating in a high performance
    culture, in-person in NYC, with high equity ownership
  - We're tackling novel, unsolved problems at the intersection
    of LLMs, complex data processing, and human ↔ AI
    interfaces
  - You'll get a front row seat to how a successful startup is
    built with plenty of leadership opportunities as we grow
    quickly
  
  We're a lean team, and our customer base is growing too fast
  for us to keep up. We're looking for talented engineers to
  join our team and execute on an ambitious roadmap.
  
  Impact
  
  We're powering mission-critical data processing at companies
  where if we get things wrong, there are real world impacts
  (e.g. missed payments, people can't move into homes on
  time).
  
  Here's a few of the complex problems you’ll be working on:
  
  - Building a QA Agent to flag low confidence results
  - Deploy an optimizer agent in a loop that improves document
    performance in the background
  - Creating multimodal models for document layout awareness
  - Novel chunking strategies for handling long documents
  - Building data pipelines and evaluating model performance
  - Building a self-correcting system that automatically gets
    better over time
  
  Role
  
  - Design novel LLM techniques for increasing the complexity of
    use cases and data streams that Extend can be applied to
  - Monitor existing models in production, understand what’s
    working well (and what isn’t), and run experiments to
    solve those issues
  - Have complete ownership over the work you do — as a founding
    team member, you’ll have the opportunity to truly own
    large areas of product and engineering and have direct
    relationship with customers.
  - Work directly with the CEO, CTO, and other founding members
    and help build out our team.
