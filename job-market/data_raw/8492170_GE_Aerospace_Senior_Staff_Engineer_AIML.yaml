  Job Description SummaryThe Senior Staff Engineer – AI/ML
  Projects is a senior technical and project leader
  responsible for shaping, leading, and delivering AI/ML
  solutions with local and global teams. This role also
  requires significant hands-on design, development, and
  deployment of AI/ML models. You will partner with customer
  and engineering teams to understand complex mechanical and
  aerospace problems, translate them into AI/ML use cases, and
  architect production-grade solutions that improve Safety,
  Quality, Delivery, and Cost. You will provide technical and
  team leadership for AI/ML initiatives within engineering
  design, leading a team of engineers to ensure timely
  delivery, high quality, and robust technical execution,
  while growing AI/ML capability through mentoring, best
  practices, and contribution to innovation and IP.Job
  Description
  
  Site Overview
  
  Established in 2000, the John F. Welch Technology Center
  (JFWTC) in Bengaluru is our multidisciplinary research and
  engineering center. Engineers and scientists at JFWTC have
  contributed to hundreds of aviation patents, pioneering
  breakthroughs in engine technologies, advanced materials,
  and additive manufacturing.
  
  Roles and Responsibilities
  
  Project Leadership & Delivery
  
  - Lead end-to-end AI/ML projects from problem framing and
    scoping through deployment and sustainment
  - Coordinate local and global, cross-functional teams to
    deliver robust, scalable solutions on time and within
    scope
  - Define project plans, milestones, risks, and mitigation
    strategies, tracking progress and resolving issues
  - Directly contribute to hands-on implementation, including
    building, testing, and deploying models as part of project
    delivery
  
  Problem Framing & Solution Design
  
  - Partner with aerospace engineering and customer teams to
    clarify requirements, constraints, and success criteria-
  - Translate engineering and business needs into clear AI/ML
    problem statements, data requirements, and technical
    approaches
  - Architect solutions, selecting appropriate models, methods,
    tools, and platforms
  
  Technical Leadership & Coaching
  
  - Provide expert guidance on AI/ML methods, including model
    development, validation, deployment, and monitoring in
    engineering workflows-
  - Solve complex technical challenges and drive root-cause
    analysis and continuous improvement
  - Mentor and coach engineers and data scientists; share
    lessons learned and best practices
  
  Innovation, IP & Communication
  
  - Foster a culture of innovation, experimentation, and
    learning within the AI/ML community
  - Identify opportunities for differentiation and contribute to
    IP (e.g., invention disclosures, patents)
  - Communicate technical concepts, findings, risks, and
    recommendations clearly to technical and non-technical
    stakeholders
  
  Education Qualification
  
  Bachelor of Science in Engineering, Physics, Chemistry,
  Mathematics, Computer Science, or equivalent technical
  discipline.
  
  AI/ML Experience
  
  - Total 12+ yrs experience, out of which 8+ years of hands-on
    experience in developing and deploying AI/ML solutions in
    engineering design environments (preferably aerospace or
    related industries)
  - Proven experience across the AI/ML lifecycle: data
    preparation, model development, validation, deployment,
    and monitoring
  
  Leadership Experience
  
  - 2+ years as a project or technical lead, managing
    multidisciplinary teams and delivering AI/ML solutions to
    production
  - Demonstrated ability to coordinate across global teams and
    stakeholders
  
  Technical Skills: Strong background in machine learning
  and/or deep learning methods relevant to engineering (e.g.,
  predictive modelling, optimization, anomaly detection,
  surrogate modelling, computer vision, physics-informed ML)
  Proficiency with common AI/ML ecosystems (e.g., Python and
  major ML libraries) and engineering data (simulation, test,
  sensor, design) Experience integrating AI/ML into
  engineering design tools or workflows is a plus
  
  
  Desired Characteristics
  
  - Strong oral and written communication skills
  - Strong interpersonal and leadership skills
  - Demonstrated ability to document, plan, market and manage
    programs that further the knowledge, understanding and
    capability of the business
  - Problem analysis and resolution skills
  - Demonstrated leadership in advancing AI/ML methods, along
    with the ability to teach others and set standard
    practices for their use in engineering design.
