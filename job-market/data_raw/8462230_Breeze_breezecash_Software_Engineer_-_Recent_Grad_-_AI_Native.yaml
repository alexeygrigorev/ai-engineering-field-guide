  Are you passionate about solving complex challenges in the
  fintech space? We’re looking for talented individuals to
  join our dynamic startup, backed by Sequoia Capital. We’re
  building the universal payment layer to unify all
  currencies—fiat and crypto—so businesses and consumers can
  transact seamlessly. If you're passionate about creating
  innovative solutions in a dynamic, fast-paced environment,
  we want to talk to you.
  
  We are hiring an AI-Native Fullstack Engineer
  
  Are you excited about building products at the intersection
  of fintech and AI? We’re looking for an AI-native Fullstack
  Engineer to join Breeze, a Sequoia-backed startup building
  the universal payment layer to unify all currencies — fiat
  and crypto — so businesses and consumers can transact
  seamlessly.
  
  In this role, you’ll work across the stack to design, build,
  and ship AI-powered, product-facing experiences end to end.
  You’ll partner closely with Product, Design, and Operations
  to turn complex financial workflows into intuitive,
  intelligent systems. This is a hands-on, product-centric
  role where engineering decisions — including how we apply AI
  — directly shape what our customers use every day.
  
  This position is hybrid in NYC, with regular in-office
  collaboration. This hire will be one of our first NYC-based
  engineers.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Build and scale user-facing fintech products that leverage
    AI as a core capability, not an afterthought.
  - Own features end-to-end — from technical design and
    implementation to iteration based on user and model
    feedback.
  - Develop in a fullstack environment using React.js and
    TypeScript on the frontend, and Node.js and TypeScript on
    the backend.
  - Design and integrate AI-driven workflows (e.g., intelligent
    automation, decision support, agentic flows, or LLM-
    powered features).
  - Partner closely with Product and Design to shape product
    requirements, UX decisions, and AI-driven interactions.
  - Stay up to date with emerging AI technologies, tools, and
    best practices, and apply them pragmatically to real
    product problems.
  - Design systems that are secure, scalable, and performant in
    a payments and financial context.
  - Collaborate with Risk, Compliance, and Operations teams to
    ensure AI-powered workflows meet regulatory and
    operational needs.
  - Communicate clearly with stakeholders and contribute to
    product planning and prioritization.
  - Thrive in a fast-paced startup environment where speed,
    ownership, and quality all matter.
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - 1+ years of professional software engineering experience,
    this includes internships, co-ops, etc.
  - Strong experience building product-driven, user-facing
    applications.
  - Solid fullstack experience with React.js, Node.js, and
    TypeScript (or similar modern frameworks).
  - Demonstrated experience building with AI-native tools or
    models (e.g., LLM APIs, embeddings, agents, prompt-driven
    workflows, model orchestration).
  - Curiosity and fluency with modern AI trends, tools, and
    platforms — you actively experiment and stay current.
  - Product mindset — you care deeply about usability, customer
    experience, and business impact.
  - Strong problem-solving skills and the ability to own
    features from concept to launch.
  - Excellent communication skills and comfort working cross-
    functionally with non-engineering partners.
  - Familiarity with building scalable, reliable systems and
    modern web architectures.
  - Bonus: experience applying AI in regulated environments
    (fintech, payments, risk, compliance) or working with
    financial APIs.

  Fast-paced and dynamic – We’re a growing startup that moves
  quickly. AI-forward – We embrace new technologies and expect
  engineers to push how products are built. Ownership and
  communication – We value people who take full ownership and
  communicate clearly across teams. Continuous learning –
