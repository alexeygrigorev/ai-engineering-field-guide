  Company Description
  
  We’re Checkout.com – you might not know our name, but
  companies like eBay, ASOS, Klarna, Uber Eats, and Sony do.
  That moment when you check out online? We make it happen.
  
  Checkout.com is where the world checks out. Our global
  network powers billions of transactions every year, making
  money move without making a fuss. We spent years perfecting
  a service most people will never notice. Because when
  digital payments just work, businesses grow, customers stay,
  and no one stops to think about why.
  
  With 19 offices spanning six continents, we feel at home
  everywhere – but London is our HQ. Wherever our people work
  their magic, they’re fast-moving, performance-obsessed, and
  driven by being better every day. Ideal. Because a role here
  isn’t just another job; it’s a career-defining opportunity
  to build the future of fintech.
