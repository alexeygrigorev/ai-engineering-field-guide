  About this role
  
  Do you enjoy solving complex engineering challenges,
  experimenting with new approaches, and working in an
  environment that combines the discipline of an enterprise
  platform with the curiosity and pace of a startup?
  
  At BlackRock, we look for engineers who are excited to push

  at global scale and evolve the foundations of our web
  platform. This includes building reliable, performant user
  experiences, shaping shared frameworks, and increasingly
  exploring how AI‑assisted workflows can accelerate how we
  design, code, and deliver value. We are evolving toward
  purpose driven, outcome oriented product engineering, where
  humans guide and validate AI generated output while taking
  full responsibility for product, engineering, and business
  outcomes.
  
  Our technology supports Portfolio Management teams
  overseeing over $14 trillion in assets, and the products you
  build will sit at the heart of tools used daily by investors
  making decisions that impact millions of people worldwide.
  It’s engineering work with real reach, real complexity, and
  real impact.
