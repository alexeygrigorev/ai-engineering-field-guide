  performing AI engineering team building and deploying real-
  world AI systems used by Fortune 500 customers. You will
  take technical ownership of critical ML components, lead
  model development and productionization efforts, and work
  closely with AI researchers, platform engineers, and product
  teams to deliver scalable, production-grade AI systems.
  
  This role is intended for experienced AI/ML engineers who
  have already built and deployed models in production
  environments and want to operate at the intersection of
  research-quality AI and real-world systems engineering.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Design, build, train, and optimize machine learning and deep
    learning models for production use
  - Lead the deployment of ML models into scalable, reliable
    production systems
  - Architect training, inference, and evaluation pipelines for
    structured and unstructured data
  - Own model performance, reliability, scalability, and
    lifecycle management
  - Drive experimentation, model iteration, and performance
    benchmarking
  - Implement and maintain high-quality ML codebases primarily
    in Python
  - Monitor, debug, and improve live production models
  - Collaborate with platform, backend, and infrastructure teams
    on system integration
  - Contribute to technical direction, architecture decisions,
    and AI roadmap planning
  - Mentor junior engineers and support team-level technical
    excellence
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD in Computer Science,
    Engineering, Mathematics, or a related field
  - 7+ years of professional experience in AI/ML, data science,
    or applied machine learning roles
  - Proven experience deploying ML systems into production
    environments
  - Strong understanding of ML fundamentals, evaluation
    methodologies, and model lifecycle management
  - Deep hands-on experience with ML frameworks such as PyTorch,
    TensorFlow, or scikit-learn
  - Strong proficiency in Python
  - Experience designing scalable ML systems and pipelines
  - Ability to operate independently and take technical
    ownership of complex systems
  - Strong problem-solving, architecture, and system-design
    skills
  
  Bonus Points
  
  - Experience with deep learning, LLMs, GenAI, or modern AI
    architectures
  - Experience building AI systems used by enterprise or large-
    scale customers
  - Strong experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
  - MLOps experience (CI/CD for ML, model deployment,
    monitoring, observability)
  - Research background, publications, or applied AI innovation
    projects
  - Experience leading AI initiatives or mentoring ML engineers
  
  Why This Role Is High-Impact
  
  - Work directly with MIT CSAIL–founded leadership
  - Build AI systems deployed to Fortune 500 customers
  - Operate at the intersection of cutting-edge AI and real-
    world production systems
  - High ownership and influence over technical direction
  - Join a well-funded, fast-growing AI startup with strong
