  We believe it takes great people to create a great product.
  That’s why our team lives our company values, and we hire
  based on them, too. Since 2010, Pipedrive has been on a
  mission to support sales and marketing teams with easy-to-
  use, powerful tools that make everyday work faster and
  easier. Today, our cloud-based software is trusted by over
  100,000 companies and used in 179 countries. We have grown
  from a five-person team to a truly international company of
  over 850+ people, representing more than 50 nationalities,
  with ten offices distributed across Europe and the US. In
  2020, Pipedrive received a majority investment from Vista
  Equity Partners, a global investment firm that invests
  exclusively in enterprise software, data and technology-
  enabled businesses, making Pipedrive the fifth unicorn from
  Estonia.
  
  We are looking for a Principal AI/ML Scientist & Engineer to
  lead a growing team of Applied Scientists and AI/ML
  Engineers. This is a role for a pragmatic "Builder-
  Scientist" - a technical leader who possesses deep
  scientific rigor but is fundamentally driven by the
  iterative shipping of data products that customers fall in
  love with. You will lead the technical strategy for AI/ML-
  based solutions designed to extract value from both
  structured and unstructured data, bridging the gap between
  advanced research and production-grade systems. Your impact
  will be measured through technical leadership, leverage, and
  the real-world business outcomes you enable.
  
  Your new adventure:
  
  - Lead and mentor a team of Applied Scientists and AI/ML
    Engineers, fostering a culture of technical excellence and
    scientific rigor
  - Lead the technical strategy for AI/ML-based solutions
    focused on extracting actionable value and insights from
    both structured CRM data and unstructured content
  - Build the intelligence within our AI-native CRM, including
    the design of autonomous agentic workflows and real-time
    reasoning engines that execute business actions safely at
    scale
  - Partner closely with the AI Platform team to drive the
    overarching strategy for large language model operations
    (LLMOps), ensuring infrastructure supports efficient
    experimentation and robust deployment
  - Apply deep scientific intuition to the design of AI systems,
    ensuring that models and data-intensive solutions are
    optimized for customer centricity and real-world
    performance
  - Act as a technical authority and multiplier across the AI/ML
    and data ecosystem, shaping the AI engineering roadmap and
    setting the bar for how we leverage the modern AI stack
  - Lead as a high-impact individual contributor on our most
    critical systems, balancing a deep love for building with
    the ability to delegate effectively and grow the team’s
    technical capabilities
  
  Does this sound like you?
  
  - 8+ years of applied science or engineering experience with a
    broad, practical understanding of the full ML and AI
    lifecycle in high-scale production environments
  - Proven ability to lead and scale a technical team, with
    experience mentoring senior talent and raising the
    technical bar of an organization
  - Deep expertise in modern AI engineering concepts and tech
    stacks, with hands-on experience in agentic system
    orchestration (e.g., LangGraph), RAG architectures, and
    vector databases
  - You are a deep scientist by training but a builder by
    choice; you prioritize shipping working, iterative
    solutions that solve real customer problems over chasing
    theoretical perfection
  - Proven track record of delivering customer and business
    value through simple and complex AI/ML-based solutions at
    scale
  - Broad exposure to ML, Deep Learning, and AI; you understand
    the practical trade-offs between different models and
    agentic frameworks
  - Excellent product sense and business awareness, with the
    ability to translate technical and scientific choices into
    tangible improvements for our users
  - Ability to lead through influence and technical authority,
    partnering with platform teams to influence strategy and
    raise the collective technical bar
  - Solid understanding of cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP),
    distributed systems, container orchestration, data
    engineering (batch pipeline, feature store, Kafka)
  
  Why Pipedrive?
  
  - People-first culture - Be part of a team that values
    authenticity, champions collaboration, and supports each
    other—no egos, just teamwork. Work alongside top talent
    from around the world in an inclusive space where
    different perspectives fuel our best ideas. Everyone is
