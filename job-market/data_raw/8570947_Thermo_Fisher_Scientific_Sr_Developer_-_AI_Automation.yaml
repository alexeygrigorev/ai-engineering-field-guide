  Job Description
  
  As part of the Thermo Fisher Scientific team, you’ll
  discover meaningful work that makes a positive impact on a
  global scale. Join our colleagues in bringing our Mission to
  life every single day to enable our customers to make the
  world healthier, cleaner and safer. We provide our global
  teams with the resources needed to achieve individual career
  goals while helping to take science a step beyond by
  developing solutions for some of the world’s toughest
  challenges, like protecting the environment, making sure our
  food is safe or helping find cures for cancer. DESCRIPTION:
  Join our innovative team as a Senior Developer and make a
  meaningful impact on global science and healthcare. In this
  role, you'll design and develop sophisticated AI &
  Automation solutions that contribute to improving health and
  environmental outcomes. You'll work with cutting-edge
  technologies across cloud platforms, data integration,
  AI/ML, and enterprise systems to deliver robust applications
  that power our essential operations. Working in an agile
  environment, you will operate as a hands-on software
  engineer within the intelligent automation and AI ecosystem,
  responsible for designing, developing, and scaling
  enterprise-grade agentic AI and automation solutions. This
  role blends Python-based AI development, agentic
  orchestration, and RPA technologies (UiPath) with Microsoft
  Power Platform, focusing on robust engineering practices
  rather than low-code configuration alone.
  
  You will design agentic systems that combine LLM-powered
  reasoning, autonomous decision-making, and Human-in-the-Loop
  (HITL) controls to deliver reliable, explainable, and
  compliant automation across complex business processes. The
  role requires deep coding expertise, system design thinking,
  reusable frameworks, and integration with enterprise
  platforms, data sources, and AI services.
  
  REQUIREMENTS:
  
  - Bachelor’s Degree plus 8+ years of experience, or Advanced
    Degree plus 6+ years of experience in software
    development, AI engineering, RPA, or intelligent
    automation
  - Strong hands-on experience designing, developing, and
    maintaining AI-driven and agentic automation solutions
    using Python, UiPath (REFramework, Orchestrator APIs,
    queues, assets), and Microsoft Power Platform
  - Proven experience building and orchestrating Agentic AI
    systems using Python-based frameworks such as LangChain,
    LangGraph, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, CrewAI, or equivalent
  - Demonstrated experience developing LLM-enabled agents,
    including prompt engineering, tool invocation, embeddings,
    vector stores, memory, planning, and decision
    orchestration
  - Expertise in designing goal-driven, event-driven, and
    stateful agent architectures, including exception
    recovery, fallback strategies, and decision routing
  - Strong experience implementing Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
    workflows using UiPath Action Center, approval mechanisms,
    and Python-based validation and feedback loops
  - Experience developing and maintaining reusable frameworks,
    libraries, and shared components using Python and .NET (C#
    and/or VB.NET) aligned with enterprise engineering
    standards
  - Hands-on experience building secure, API-first integrations
    using REST/SOAP services, JSON/XML, message queues, and
    enterprise authentication mechanisms
  - Strong experience integrating automation and AI solutions
    with enterprise platforms such as SFDC, SQL databases,
    SharePoint, cloud services, AI platforms, and legacy
    systems
  - Strong experience of Windows automation, attended and
    unattended bot execution models, and Citrix automation
    challenges
  - Experience implementing robust exception handling,
    structured logging, observability, retries, and
    performance optimization in distributed and semi-
    autonomous systems
  - Proficiency with Git-based version control and Azure DevOps,
    including branching strategies, pull requests, CI/CD
    pipelines, and automated deployments
  - Demonstrated ability to troubleshoot complex production
    issues, perform root-cause analysis, and drive continuous
    improvement in enterprise environments
  - Experience conducting peer code reviews, enforcing coding
    standards, and providing technical mentorship to other
    developers
  - Ability to collaborate effectively with architecture,
    security, data, and compliance teams to ensure solutions
    meet enterprise governance, security, and regulatory
    requirements
  
  PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS
  
  - Experience with UiPath AI Center, Document Understanding,
    Power Platform AI Builder, or equivalent AI/ML platforms
  - Familiarity with automated testing frameworks for AI, RPA,
    and agent-based systems
  - Experience working in regulated or validated enterprise
    environments (GxP, SOX, FDA, or equivalent)
  - UiPath Advanced Certification and/or Microsoft Power
    Platform certifications
  - Exposure to AI governance, model validation, explainability,
    and auditability in enterprise environments
