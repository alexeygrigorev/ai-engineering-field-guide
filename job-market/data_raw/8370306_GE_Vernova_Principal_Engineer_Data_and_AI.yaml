  Principal Engineer – Data & AI
  
  Job Description
  
  Consulting Services, a part of GE Vernova, has offices in
  multiple countries and offers our global clients (external &
  internal GE) a wide range of solutions across the entire
  spectrum of power generation, delivery, and utilization. Our
  Power Systems Engineering team utilizes their deep knowledge
  of connected power grid planning, design, operation, and
  life-cycle management, to offer customized solutions to our
  global clients. Our Power Economics team offers analyses
  focused on the understanding and the study of the financial
  and physical operation of the electric power systems
  including generation and grid planning, system optimization,
  asset valuation, competitive power markets and energy policy
  implications. Our software business plays a critical role in
  delivering these solutions by developing and maintaining
  cutting-edge analytics platforms for production cost
  modeling, capacity expansion, reliability assessment, market
  simulation and both steady-state and transient stability
  simulation. These tools are continuously enhanced based on
  feedback from consulting engagements and evolving industry
  needs. Over 700 entities worldwide use our suite of software
  tools to assess the economics, performance, and reliability
  of interconnected power systems. We also offer a full range
  of education courses through our Power Systems Engineering
  Course.
  
  GE Vernova’s Consulting Services business is advancing the
  future of power system planning, simulation, and decision
  support for utilities, system operators, and regulators
  worldwide. We are seeking a Principal Engineer – Data & AI
  to provide technical leadership across the data, reporting,
  and AI foundations of our planning platform PlanOS.
  
  In this role, you will own the end-to-end data strategy
  supporting long-term transmission and generation planning,
  capacity expansion, reliability assessment, and scenario
  analysis. You will drive the design of robust, auditable,
  and reproducible data models, ensure scalable execution of
  large multi-scenario planning studies, and lead the
  responsible adoption of AI to enhance insight,
  explainability, and decision-making—while maintaining the
  rigor required in regulated environments.
  
  You will operate at the intersection of software
  engineering, power system planning, data architecture, and
  applied AI, partnering closely with product teams, domain
  experts, and customer-facing organizations.
  
  Roles & Responsibilities
  
  - Own the end-to-end data architecture and reporting strategy
    for PlanOS planning platform.
  - Design and govern data models and schemas for planning
    inputs, intermediate results, and outputs.
  - Ensure data versioning, lineage, and reproducibility to
    support auditable and defensible planning results.
  - Optimize storage and data access patterns for large, multi-
    scenario and multi-year planning studies.
  - Enable clear, consistent reporting by translating complex
    planning results into dashboards, narratives, and
    interactive analysis tools for planners, executives, and
    regulators.
  - Identify and lead AI/ML use cases that add value to long-
    term grid planning.
  - Ensure AI methods are explainable, traceable, and
    appropriate for regulated planning environments.
  - Partner with engineering teams to integrate data and AI
    workflows into production-grade planning software.
  - Act as a technical bridge between software teams, power
    system experts, and customer-facing organizations.
  - Own data governance, quality assurance, and validation
    processes across the planning platform.
  - Balance innovation with rigor when introducing new data and
    AI capabilities into critical planning workflows.
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science,
    Electrical Engineering, Power Systems, Data Engineering,
    or a related discipline.
  - 10+ years of experience in data engineering, data
    architecture, platform engineering, or related roles.
  - Strong hands-on experience with Python and SQL in enterprise
    software systems.
  - Proven expertise in designing and maintaining robust data
    models and schemas for complex platforms.
  - Experience with large-scale analytical, simulation, or
    optimization-driven systems.
  - Demonstrated ability to provide technical leadership across
    teams without direct authority.
  - Strong written and verbal communication skills, with the
    ability to explain complex technical concepts to diverse
    audiences.
  
  Desired Characteristics
  
  - Experience with grid planning, power system simulation, or
    energy market tools (e.g., PSLF, PlanOS, or similar
    platforms).
  - Familiarity with optimization and planning frameworks such
    as Pyomo, CVXPY, OR-Tools, Gurobi, or CPLEX.
  - Experience designing enterprise-grade APIs and persistence
    layers, including ORM-based data access (e.g., SQLAlchemy)
    and long-lived service frameworks (e.g., Pyramid).
  - Hands-on experience with cloud-based data platforms (AWS or
    Azure), including data lakes and distributed compute.
  - Background in data versioning, lineage, and auditability for
    regulated or high-assurance environments.
  - Practical experience introducing AI/ML into production
    systems with a focus on explainability and governance.
  - Strong systems-thinking mindset with the ability to balance
    near-term delivery with long-term platform evolution.
  - Passion for building trusted, high-impact software that
    supports critical infrastructure planning.
