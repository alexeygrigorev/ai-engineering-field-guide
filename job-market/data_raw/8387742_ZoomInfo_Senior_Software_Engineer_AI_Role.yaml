  About the Role:
  
  We're seeking a Senior Software Engineer with strong Python
  skills and a passion for building intelligent agentic
  systems. This role is ideal for someone who thrives at
  building applications powered by LLMs, bringing both
  technical depth and entrepreneurial thinking to complex
  problems. You'll work on cutting-edge AI agent systems that
  leverage existing language models to solve real-world
  challenges.
  
  What You'll Do:
  
  - Design, develop, and deploy production-grade agentic AI
    systems powered by LLMs
  - Build scalable Python services and orchestration pipelines
    for complex multi-step agent workflows
  - Architect frameworks that enable agents to reason, plan, use
    tools, and execute autonomous tasks
  - Integrate LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) into robust,
    reliable production systems
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to translate
    business requirements into technical solutions
  - Optimize system performance, reliability, and cost-
    efficiency of LLM-powered applications
  - Evaluate and integrate emerging LLM technologies and agentic
    patterns into our product stack
  - Contribute to technical strategy and architectural decisions
    with an entrepreneurial mindset
  - Mentor other engineers and promote best practices in
    building AI-powered systems
  
  What you bring:
  
  - 7+ years of professional software engineering experience
  - Strong proficiency in Python with deep understanding of
    software design patterns and best practices
  - Understanding of machine learning concepts (how models work,
    their capabilities and limitations)
  - Hands-on experience working with Large Language Models
    (OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source models, etc.)
  - Proven track record building AI agents or agentic systems
    (tool use, reasoning, multi-step workflows, function
    calling)
  - Excellent analytical and problem-solving skills with ability
    to debug complex systems
  - Strong communication skills and ability to work
    collaboratively in a team environment
  - Entrepreneurial spirit - self-motivated, comfortable with
    ambiguity, and bias toward action
  
  Nice to Have:
  
  - Active contributions to open-source projects (especially in
    AI/agentic systems space)
  - Experience with prompt engineering, RAG systems, or
    embedding-based search
  - Familiarity with vector databases and semantic search
    technologies
  - Knowledge of LLM orchestration frameworks (LangChain,
    LlamaIndex, etc.)
  - Experience with modern workflow orchestration (Temporal,
    Airflow, etc.)
  - Background in distributed systems or high-scale applications
  - Experience with agent frameworks or MCP (Model Context
    Protocol)
  - Publications, blog posts, or technical talks in AI/agents
    domains
  - Experience building developer tools or platforms
