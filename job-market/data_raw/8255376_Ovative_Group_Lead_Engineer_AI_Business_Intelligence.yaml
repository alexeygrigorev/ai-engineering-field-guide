  About Ovative Group:
  
  Ovative Group is an independent, full-funnel media,
  measurement, and creative firm. Leveraging our deep industry
  expertise, we help brands like Best Buy, Domino's, American
  Eagle, The Home Depot, Post, Disney, Tumi, Michael Kors,
  Boost Mobile, and UnitedHealth Group transform their media
  and measurement programs. The result? Profitable growth that
  speaks for itself.
  
  
  
  At Ovative, we don't just track data, we redefine success.
  How do we do it? Our proprietary MarTech platform, EMRge
  helps businesses transform marketing into a driver of
  sustainable growth. Powered by Enterprise Marketing Return
  (EMR), our differentiated approach to holistic media buying,
  planning, and measurement, EMRge is the first MarTech
  platform to measure businesses holistically. We're all about
  raising the bar every day, and it shows. Our work has been
  recognized by organizations like Digiday, Google, Inc. 5000,
  USA Today, and Search Engine Land.
  
  About the Role:
  
  In this role, you will be the technical owner of Ovative’s
  AI Analytics Platform, leading the design and delivery of a
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system and the
  supporting services required to make it secure, scalable,
  and usable across the business.
  
  
  
  This role is intentionally hands-on and requires prior
  experience building RAG-style or AI-driven analytics
  systems. Ovative is early in this capability area, and this
  role is expected to bring proven architectural patterns and
  execution experience rather than learning them from scratch.
  
  
  
  You will lead the build of platform components that do not
  exist today, including document ingestion and storage,
  indexing and vector search, semantic modeling, and system
  integrations. Many of these capabilities will leverage
  Databricks-native services, while others will require
  thoughtful integration with enterprise systems such as
  Confluence, Slack, and SSO via Entra.
  
  
  
  Responsibilities of a Lead Engineer:
  
  - Serve as the technical owner of Ovative’s RAG-based AI
    Analytics Platform, leading the system from initial design
    through production use.
  
  - Partner closely with Product Management to translate
    ambiguous business questions into clear, feasible platform
    capabilities, framing options and tradeoffs (accuracy,
    latency, security, and cost) with clear connection to
    business outcomes
  
  - Design and build new platform components, including:
  
  - Document ingestion and storage services
  
  - Indexing and vector database capabilities
  
  - Semantic layer abstractions for governed analytics
  
  - Orchestration logic coordinating retrieval, SQL generation,
    and model interaction
  
  - Lead integrations with enterprise systems including:
  
  - Authentication and authorization (SSO, entitlements)
  
  - Knowledge sources (e.g., Confluence, internal file stores)
  
  - User interfaces and request channels (e.g., Slack, EMRge, BI
    tools)
  
  - Apply established RAG and AI analytics patterns to prevent
    hallucinations, enforce business logic, and ensure
    traceability of answers.
  
  - Leverage and extend native solutions where appropriate,
    while defining clear system boundaries.
  
  - Follow technical standards for AI safety, access control,
    observability, and cost management.
  
  - Translate business questions into platform capabilities by
    partnering with Product and domain stakeholders.
  
  - Break down complex platform initiatives into sequenced work
    that a small engineering team can execute effectively.
  
  - Mentor other engineers by transferring context and patterns
    as the platform matures.
  
  
  
  Experience Needed
  
  Requirements:
  
  - 8+ years of experience in software engineering, data
    engineering, or applied analytics roles.
  
  - Demonstrated experience designing and delivering RAG-based
    systems, search platforms, or AI-powered analytics
    applications in production.
  
  - Experience working with embeddings, vector databases, and
    retrieval pipelines.
  
  - Strong proficiency in Python and SQL, with experience
    building production data or platform services.
  
  - Experience integrating multiple systems and tools (data
    platforms, document systems, authentication, user
    interfaces).
  
  - Experience utilizing large complex datasets in advanced AI
    models to surface insights and recommendations.
  
  - Familiarity with cloud data platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure);
    experience with Databricks is strongly preferred.
  
  - Strong communication skills and comfort leading technical
    discussions across disciplines.
  
  - Experience partnering with Product Management and
    stakeholders to define platform capabilities, including
    communicating technical feasibility, constraints, and
    tradeoffs to non-technical audiences.
  
  
  
  Preferred:
  
  - Experience operating AI systems in governed or compliance-
    sensitive environments.
  
  - Experience building or extending semantic layers for
    analytics or BI.
  
  - Experience integrating enterprise tools such as Confluence,
    Slack, or similar collaboration platforms.
  
  - Exposure to recommendation systems, insight generation, or
    other applied AI use cases beyond Q&A.
