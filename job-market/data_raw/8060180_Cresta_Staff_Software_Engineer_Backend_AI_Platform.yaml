  Cresta is on a mission to turn every customer conversation
  into a competitive advantage by unlocking the true potential
  of the contact center. Our platform combines the best of AI
  and human intelligence to help contact centers discover
  customer insights and behavioral best practices, automate
  conversations and inefficient processes, and empower every

  prestigious Stanford AI lab, Cresta's co-founder and

  Waymo, Udacity, and more. Our leadership also includes CEO,

  Join us on this thrilling journey to revolutionize the
  workforce with AI. The future of work is here, and it's at
  Cresta.
  
  About the role:
  
  - Own model serving: Design, build, and maintain low-latency,
    highly-available serving stacks for in-house ML model
    serving and integrating with LLM serving partners.
  - Automate training pipelines: Orchestrate data prep,
    training, evaluation, and registry workflows on Kubernetes
    with solid MLOps practices.
  - Optimize at scale: Profile and tune throughput, memory, and
    cost; introduce caching, sharding, batching, and GPU/CPU
    autoscaling where it pays off.
  - Build platform primitives: Create reusable SDKs, templates,
    and CLI tools that let research and product teams ship
    models independently and safely.
  - Raise the bar: Instrument deep observability (tracing,
    metrics, alerts), drive blameless post-mortems, and mentor
    engineers on production ML best practices.

  - 5+ years writing production software; 2+ years focused on ML
    platform or infra.

  - Proven experience with one or more serving frameworks (e.g.,
    vLLM, Triton, TorchServe).
  - Kubernetes and cloud-native ops.
  - Solid grasp of distributed systems, networking, and
    container security.
  - Culture of rigorous testing, code review, and continuous
    delivery.
  
  Nice-to-haves
  
  - Hands-on with large language models or real-time streaming
    inference.
  - Terraform, Helm, or similar IaC tooling.
  - Experience in speech or conversational AI domains.

  Compensation at Cresta
  
  Cresta’s approach to compensation is simple: recognize
  impact, reward excellence, and invest in our people. We
  offer competitive, location-based pay that reflects the
  market and what each individual brings to the table.
  
  The posted base salary range represents what we expect to

  geography. In addition to base pay, total compensation

  the industry, where scammers attempt to access candidates'
  personal and financial information through fake interviews
  and offers. All Cresta recruiting email communications will
  always come from the @cresta.ai domain. Any outreach
  claiming to be from Cresta via other sources should be
  ignored.  If you are uncertain whether you have been
  contacted by an official Cresta employee, reach out to
