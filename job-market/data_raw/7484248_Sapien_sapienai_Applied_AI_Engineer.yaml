  Who we are
  
  Sapien is rethinking how finance teams operate in the age of
  AI. We’re building toward an autonomous CFO—systems that run
  company financials end-to-end. Our platform analyzes complex
  financial data in real time to increase decision cadence,
  prevent costly mistakes, and surface value. Sapien has
  caught multi-million-dollar errors, saved thousands of jobs,
  and returned significant dollars to customers’ bottom lines.
  
  We partner with traditional businesses—manufacturing,
  healthcare, restaurants, and large enterprises—to deeply
  understand and automate their financial workflows. We’re
  HQ’d by Madison Square Park in NYC and backed by General
  Catalyst, Neo, and top operators from Google, OpenAI,
  Microsoft, Ramp, and Stripe (over $9M raised).
  
  The role
  
  You'll build the AI agent capabilities that power Sapien's
  autonomous finance operations. This means designing novel
  architectures for reasoning over complex financial data,
  implementing verifiable and observable agent workflows, and
  building systems that learn and adapt to each company's
  unique operations.
  
  This is a research-meets-product role. You'll work on
  cutting-edge agent capabilities—from observability and
  library learning to semantic search and multi-modal
  parsing—and ship them directly into production for
  customers.
  
  What you'll do
  
  - Design and implement agent architectures that enable
    observability, human-in-the-loop verification, and precise
    context control across complex financial workflows.
  - Build library learning systems that reduce LLM dependencies
    by learning reusable patterns for planning, code
    generation, and data localization from customer
    interactions.
  - Create graph-based company representations and develop
    efficient search methods using embeddings, semantic
    clustering, and custom retrieval strategies.
  - Build multi-modal parsers that unify diverse financial data
    sources (Excel, ERPs, CRMs) into coherent, queryable
    schemas that agents can reason over.
  - Implement RL and fine-tuning pipelines based on user
    feedback, pairwise preferences, and implicit interaction
    signals to improve agent performance over time.
  - Design benchmarking and evaluation suites that quantify
    Sapien's accuracy, reliability, and business impact across
    different customer workflows.
  
  What we're looking for
  
  - Quality experience building production AI/ML
    systems—deploying models at scale, ideally in complex,
    data-intensive domains.
  - Strong algorithmic thinking. Demonstrated through ML
    research, competitive programming, mathematics, or
    building novel systems from scratch.
  - Deep experience with modern agent frameworks, LLMs, and AI
    systems: fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, tool use, or
    agentic architectures.
  - Comfort working end-to-end: from implementing research ideas
    and prototyping architectures to deploying production
    systems and iterating on real customer feedback.
  - Ability to move between abstraction levels—designing high-
    level agent workflows while debugging low-level
    implementation details.
  - CS, Math, or Engineering degree or equivalent experience. We
    care most about what you've built.
  
  How you work (values we care about)
  
  - Adaptability: You thrive on diverse, open-ended problems.
    One day you're implementing a new agent architecture, the
    next you're debugging a customer data issue—and you bring
    the same intensity to both.
  - Ownership: You take problems from research paper to
    production. You don't wait for direction—you identify what
    needs to happen and drive it to completion.
  - Opinionated: You have strong technical perspectives on what
    works and what doesn't. You push back on approaches you
    disagree with and make the team's thinking sharper.
  - Mission-driven: You're energized by building AI that
    transforms how businesses run. You connect technical
    decisions to real customer outcomes and care deeply about
    the impact.
  - Collaborative excellence: You share knowledge, give
    thoughtful feedback, and invest in making the team better.
    You bring new ideas from papers and discussions to elevate
    everyone's thinking.
