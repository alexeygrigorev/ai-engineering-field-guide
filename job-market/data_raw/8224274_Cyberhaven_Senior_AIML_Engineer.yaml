  About the role:
  
  We’re looking for an experienced Backend engineer to help
  drive and evolve our product, focusing on high-impact
  innovation projects as part of our Linea AI team. You will
  be working on cutting-edge technology and ideas and bringing
  AI prototypes to production. You will work closely with Labs
  team to operationalize and scale AI prototypes across many
  customers.
  
  What you’ll do:
  
  - Design and scale distributed systems: Architect, build, and
    optimize highly scalable and fault-tolerant systems that
    process large graph datasets at enterprise scale, handling
    billions of events in real time from tens of thousands of
    endpoints with sub-second latency.
  - Solve complex scaling challenges: Tackle real-world
    performance and reliability problems through deep
    analysis, profiling, and systematic troubleshooting in
    high-throughput distributed environments.
  - Build with modern infrastructure: Develop and evolve a
    microservices-based architecture using technologies such
    as Python, Kubernetes, Docker, and Redis, in a
    continuously improving production stack.
  - Engineer secure-by-design software: Write hardened,
    security-first code capable of safely processing untrusted
    data, resisting real-world attack vectors, and operating
    reliably across large-scale, internet-facing systems.
  - Productionize AI systems: Partner with research and product
    teams to operationalize AI prototypes, turning
    experimental models into robust, scalable, and production-
    ready services.
  
  Who you are:
  
  - Proven Backend Expertise: 6+ years of experience building
    and scaling backend systems, with strong proficiency in
    Python, powering production applications used at scale.
  - Full-Stack Impact: Demonstrated track record of designing
    and delivering full-stack applications that are actively
    used in real-world, high-traffic environments.
  - Generative AI & ML at Scale: Hands-on production experience
    with large-scale foundational models and transformer-based
    architectures, including deploying, monitoring, and
    iterating on GenAI systems.
  - Agent & Workflow Systems: At least 1 year of experience
    building AI agents and orchestration workflows using
    frameworks such as LangChain, LangGraph, Genkit, or
    similar technologies.
  - ML Systems & Data Pipelines: Experience delivering machine
    learning systems at scale, including robust model
    evaluation, continuous quality improvement pipelines, and
    data processing using columnar databases and large
    messaging systems (e.g., Pub/Sub, Kafka).
  - Ownership & Innovation Mindset: Comfortable working in
    remote, fast-paced environments, with an entrepreneurial
    mindset-driven to solve complex, real-world problems
    through innovation and breakthrough technology.
  
  Good to have:
  
  - Security & Product Domain Experience: Background building
    products in data security, DLP, or application security
    environments.
  - Cloud Data & AI Workflows: Experience with GCS and BigQuery,
    and familiarity with LangGraph or similar frameworks for
    AI agent orchestration.
  - LLM Evaluation & Quality Systems: Hands-on experience
    designing or operating LLM evaluation pipelines, including
    automated testing, monitoring, and continuous quality
    improvement.
  
  Joining Cyberhaven is a chance to revolutionize data
  security. Traditional tools fall short, but we’ve reimagined
  protection with AI-enabled data lineage that analyzes
  billions of workflows to understand data, detect risk, and
  stop threats. Backed by $250M from leading investors like
  Khosla and Redpoint, our team includes leaders who built
  industry-defining technologies at CrowdStrike, Palo Alto
  Networks, Meta, Google, and more. This role lets you shape
  the future of data security, alongside experts driven to
  help customers protect their most valuable information.
