  About the Role
  
  Join forces with Appnovation to deliver high-impact results
  for one of our key strategic partners - a global leader in
  their field. This engagement offers a unique vantage point
  into a world-class organization with exceptional
  opportunities for professional growth and long-term career
  advancement
  
  As a Senior AI Software Engineer, you'll transform business
  ideas into production-ready applications using cutting-edge
  AI design tools and modern full-stack frameworks. With a
  strong bias toward frontend development, you specialize in
  the critical early stages—from concept through pre-totype to
  prototype—where design systems meet AI-augmented
  development. You are a visionary technologist who sits at
  the intersection of engineering excellence and AI
  innovation. Your mission is to oversee the entire "concept-
  to-production" pipeline, ensuring our teams leverage
  cutting-edge AI tools to deliver enterprise-grade
  applications at unprecedented speeds.
  
  While you maintain a deep technical foundation in full-stack
  development, your primary focus is strategic leadership:
  defining design system standards, optimizing AI-augmented
  workflows, and mentoring a high-performance team of
  developers and AI builders.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Strategic AI Integration: Direct the adoption of AI design
    tools (v0.dev, bolt.new, Lovable) to compress the
    development lifecycle from weeks to days without
    sacrificing quality.
  - Architecture & Standards: Define and enforce the technical
    standards for production-ready full-stack applications,
    ensuring scalability, performance, and accessibility
    across all projects.
  - Design-Dev Synthesis: Lead the integration of Figma-based
    design systems with AI-driven development to create
    seamless, automated handoff processes.
  - Operational Excellence: Manage a ticket-driven workflow in
    Jira, optimizing team velocity and ensuring technical
    documentation meets enterprise-level requirements.
  - Cross-Functional Partnership: Act as a bridge between
    Strategy, Creative, and Technology departments to ensure
    AI-powered solutions meet complex business objectives.
  - Backend & Data Strategy: Oversee the implementation of
    robust backend services (Supabase, SQL/NoSQL) and secure
    authentication frameworks (OAuth, JWT) across the
    portfolio.
  - Design and implement RESTful APIs and backend services using
    platforms like Supabase to support frontend functionality.
  - Collaborate with UX Designers, AI Builders, and Innovation
    Leads throughout the development lifecycle.
  
  Qualification
  
  - 8–12+ years in full-stack development, with at least 3+
    years in a leadership or management capacity. Bonus points
    if you have experience working in a startup or rapid
    prototyping environment.
  - Proven track record of implementing AI design tools(such as
    v0.dev, bolt.new, Lovable, or similar platforms) and
    workflow automation (e.g., N8N) within a professional
    engineering team.
  - Deep expertise in modern frameworks (React, Vue, Nuxt),
    TypeScript, and multiple backend languages including
    Python, PHP, and NodeJS.
  - Expert-level knowledge of design systems, design tokens, and
    CSS frameworks (Tailwind) to ensure brand consistency at
    scale.
  - Comprehensive understanding of cloud platforms (AWS, Azure,
    GCP), deployment workflows, and enterprise security
    patterns.
  - Solid understanding of backend development, including API
    design (REST, GraphQL), server-side logic, and database
    management.
  - Proficiency with authentication mechanisms (OAuth, JWT) and
    security best practices.
  - Expert-level proficiency with Figma, including design system
    management and component libraries.
  - A portfolio demonstrating not just individual code, but the
    leadership of complex, full-stack applications built using
    AI-augmented methodologies.
  - Strong attention to detail and a passion for innovation.
  - Ability to work in a fast-paced and dynamic environment.
