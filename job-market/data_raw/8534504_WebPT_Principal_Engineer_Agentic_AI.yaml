title: Principal Engineer, Agentic AI
company: WebPT
location: USA

level: Expert/Leader
description: |
  Who We Are Looking For
  
  We are looking for  a technical leader and subject matter
  expert in Agentic AI, responsible for defining the
  architectural goals and implementation strategies for our
  AI-driven workflows. When designing agentic systems, this
  leader performs deep dives into clinical business needs—such
  as ambient listening, scheduling, and documentation—before
  selecting the appropriate LLM orchestration tools and
  strategies. This leader would work closely with product
  managers and data scientists to translate complex business
  problems into scalable, agentic solutions that enhance
  clinical efficiency and the patient experience.
  
  What You’ll Be Doing As A Part of Our Team
  
  Architectural Strategy & Agentic Design
  
  - Problem Decomposition: Excel at decomposing complex clinical
    workflows into discrete, reasoning-based AI agents,
    organizing the architectural strategies needed to
    implement them.
  - Agentic Orchestration: Define the root business problems and
    use that knowledge to design integrated AI solutions
    (e.g., ambient listening for documentation or automated
    waitlist management) across multiple applications.
  - Reference Architecture Alignment: Work with the company’s
    architecture team to ensure AI agents are built on shared
    services and systems, reducing waste and maintaining a
    cohesive software ecosystem.
  - Innovation & Competitiveness: Set goals around emerging AI
    standards and agentic frameworks to keep the business
    competitive in the rapidly evolving AI-native EMR market.
  
  Execution & Partnership
  
  - Collaborative Leadership: Partner with internal Data
    Scientists and third-party AI engineers to drive project
    execution, serving as the technical anchor for the team
    during the staff augmentation phase and beyond.
  - Agile AI Development: Apply agile and lean principles to AI
    development, timeboxing experiments and focusing on
    delivering immediate clinical value through iterative
    agent refinement.
  - Cross-Functional Alignment: Work with stakeholders outside
    of engineering to align AI capabilities with Product and
    UX goals, ensuring agents are streamlined and intuitive
    for healthcare providers.
  - Documentation & Evangelism: Maintain strong documentation
    practices to evangelize new AI development patterns and
    gain adoption of agentic practices across the department.
  
  What You Should Have to Qualify
  
  - Education & Experience: Bachelor’s degree in Computer
    Science, AI/ML, or a related technical field, with 10+
    years of professional engineering experience, including
    significant time spent in a Principal Engineer or Lead
    Architect capacity.
  - Agentic AI Architecture: Deep technical proficiency in
    designing multi-agent orchestration systems. You must have
    hands-on experience with frameworks (e.g., LangGraph,
    AutoGen, CrewAI) and a sophisticated understanding of
    agentic patterns like planning, tool-use, and self-
    reflection.
  - Hybrid Team Leadership: Proven ability to provide technical
    "anchor" leadership in a hybrid environment, effectively
    directing the work of third-party staff augmentation while
    maintaining absolute ownership of the internal quality and
    architectural standards.
  - System Decomposition & Modeling: Expert-level ability to
    take a messy clinical workflow (like a PT initial
    evaluation) and decompose it into a structured data model
    and a sequence of AI-driven reasoning steps.
  - Strategic Problem Solving: A track record of "Deep Dives"
    into complex business domains, translating nebulous
    clinical needs into precise technical requirements that
    align with a broader Reference Architecture.
  - Engineering Rigor in AI: Experience moving AI from
    "prototype/notebook" to "production-grade," including
    implementing evaluation frameworks (LLM-as-a-judge),
    monitoring for agent drift, and ensuring deterministic
    outcomes in non-deterministic systems.
  
  Ideally, You Would Also Have These
  
  - Healthcare Domain Knowledge: Familiarity with clinical
    documentation standards, HIPAA compliance, and the nuances
    of EMR data sets.
  - Vector Database Experience: High-level understanding of
    retrieval strategies (RAG) to support agentic reasoning
    and long-term memory.
  - Team Transition Experience: Previous experience leading a
    hybrid team of internal and external resources, with the
    ability to take full ownership of the technology stack
    post-vendor disengagement.
  
  Culture is at our Core
  
  - Service: Create Raving Fans
  - Accountability: F Up; Own Up
  - Attitude: Possess True Grit
  - Personality: Be Minty
  - Work Ethic: Be Rock Solid
  - Community Outreach: Give Back
  - Health and Wellness: Live Better
  - Resource Efficiency: Do Más With Menos
