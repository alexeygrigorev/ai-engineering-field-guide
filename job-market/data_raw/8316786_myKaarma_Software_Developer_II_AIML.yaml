  At myKaarma, we’re not just leading the way in fixed ops
  solutions for the automotive industry—we’re redefining
  what’s possible for dealership service centers.
  Headquartered in Long Beach, California, and powered by a
  global team, our industry-leading SaaS platform combines
  communication, scheduling, and payment tools in one seamless
  solution that keeps dealerships and vehicle owners
  connected. With myKaarma, every service interaction flows
  effortlessly, bringing good karma to customers and service
  teams.
  
  Rooted in the principles of the Toyota Production System, we
  operate with precision, efficiency, and a relentless focus
  on continuous improvement to deliver a better experience for
  all. We’re looking for innovators, problem-solvers, and tech
  enthusiasts passionate about building solutions that people
  love to use. If you’re ready to make an impact in an
  industry ripe for change, join us at myKaarma and help shape
  the future of automotive service.
  
  Role Description:  What Will You Do?
  
  - Design, develop, and test software components used by
    automotive dealerships to interact with their customers.
  - Lead the design, build, and integration of AI/ML solutions,
    including:
    - Developing and consuming LLM APIs.
    - Training, fine-tuning, and deploying models into production
      systems.
  - Collaborate directly with business stakeholders—including
    customers—to understand requirements and deliver impactful
    solutions.
  - Work across a variety of tech stacks (microservices, mobile
    development, cloud platforms, etc.) in a fast-moving,
    dynamic environment.
  - Mentor and review the work of SDE I engineers, helping them
    grow in technical expertise.
  - Take initiative to improve overall system architecture,
    scalability, and reliability.
  - Exercise ownership by challenging trade-offs between speed
    and reliability when building solutions (“pulling the
    Andon cord”).
  
  Education & Experience
  
  - 2–5 years of experience developing cloud-based software
    services with a strong understanding of design for
    scalability, performance, and reliability.
  - 2+ years of hands-on experience deploying and optimizing
    AI/ML solutions in production environments.
  - Education: BTech or Equivalent 4yr degree in Computer
    Science/Engineering (Tier 1/Tier 2 institutes such as
    IIT/NIT preferred, but not required).
  - Skills:
    - Proficiency in at least one modern programming language
      (Java, Python, or C#).
    - Understanding of data structures, algorithms, and design
      principles.
    - Strong communication skills for working with technical and
      non-technical teammates.
    - Curiosity and eagerness to learn new tools, frameworks, and
      architectures.
    - Operating system and networking fundas
    - AI/ML Fundas:
      - Data & ML Lifecycle
        - Core Concepts: Can clearly explain the purpose and
          importance of train/validation/test splits.
        - Data Intuition: Understands "garbage in, garbage out." Can
          discuss the conceptual importance of data cleaning,
          normalization, and augmentation.
        - Evaluation: Can explain the purpose of common metrics (e.g.,
          accuracy, precision/recall, loss). Can look at a
          training/validation loss curve and identify clear
          overfitting or underfitting.
      - Neural Networks (NNs)
        - Core Concepts: Can intuitively explain the basic components
          of a neural network (neurons, layers, weights,
          activation functions) and their purpose.
        - Training Dynamics: Understands, at a high level, how a
          network "learns" via loss functions, gradient
          descent, and backpropagation.
        - Practical Intuition: Can conceptually differentiate between
          training and inference and is familiar with core
          issues like overfitting and underfitting.
      - Transformers
        - Motivation: Understands the motivation for the Transformer
          architecture (e.g., the limitations of sequential
          models like RNNs/CNNs for long-range dependencies).
        - *Core Mechanics: Can intuitively explain the purpose of key
          components like self-attention, positional
          encodings, and the encoder-decoder structure.
        - *Attention Intuition: Grasps the basic idea of self-
          attention (how a model learns which words are
          important to each other) and multi-head attention
          (looking at a sequence in different "ways").
      - Large Language Models (LLMs)
        - *Architecture & Scaling: Understands the relationship
          between Transformers and LLMs and is aware of
          concepts like scaling laws and the pre-
          training/fine-tuning paradigm.
        - Practical Pipeline: Familiar with the concepts of
          tokenization (how text is processed) and prompt-
          based interaction.
        - Application Concepts: Aware of core application patterns
          like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and the
          idea of LLM-based agents.
        - Responsible AI: Recognizes model limitations (e.g.,
          hallucinations) and understands the importance of
          responsible AI, safety, and model interpretability.
  
                              * Nice to have
