  About the Role
  
  Cyberhaven’s lineage technology tracks billions of data
  events, and this role is focused on building the intelligent
  service layer that makes that data actionable at scale. You
  will develop backend systems that wrap massive lineage
  datasets in an agentic framework, enabling fleets of AI
  agents to perform work traditionally handled by security
  consultants. These agents will autonomously audit customer
  environments, generate intelligence-driven security
  policies, and diagnose complex data security incidents by
  tracing file activity across months of history in seconds.
  This role sits at the intersection of data engineering,
  distributed systems, and applied AI, with a strong focus on
  turning rich product data into scalable, automated security
  outcomes.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Build the service layer that enables AI agents to perform
    complex, multi-step security workflows as software
  - Develop backend services that allow agents to reason over
    lineage data, security logs, and customer context
  - Implement AI agents that leverage product data to generate
    audits, recommendations, and diagnostics
  - Write high-performance SQL and data extraction logic in
    BigQuery to surface structured, agent-ready context from
    billions of lineage events
  - Design and consume API-first integrations connecting
    Cyberhaven’s platform to LLM providers and downstream
    customer workflows
  - Build automated diagnostic flows where agents iteratively
    query data, interpret results, and produce human-readable
    explanations of security incidents
  - Partner with internal teams to ensure agent-driven outputs
    are reliable, scalable, and aligned with real customer use
    cases
  
  Who You Are
  
  - Strong experience building backend services using Python
    and/or Go
  - Familiarity with designing and implementing agentic
    workflows that manage state, tool usage, and multi-step
    reasoning
  - Comfortable writing and optimizing complex SQL over large,
    high-cardinality datasets in BigQuery
  - Experience modeling data for LLM consumption, including
    structured context windows, embeddings, or retrieval-based
    approaches
  - Hands-on experience designing and consuming RESTful APIs as
    part of distributed systems
  - Strong understanding of integrating external systems and
    services via APIs
  - Practical experience working with LLMs via APIs, including
    prompt design, structured outputs, and performance trade-
    offs
  - Experience building guardrails, validation layers, or
    verification mechanisms to ensure AI outputs are accurate
    and trustworthy
  
  Joining Cyberhaven is a chance to revolutionize data
  security. Traditional tools fall short, but we’ve reimagined
  protection with AI-enabled data lineage that analyzes
  billions of workflows to understand data, detect risk, and
  stop threats. Backed by $250M from leading investors like
  Khosla and Redpoint, our team includes leaders who built
  industry-defining technologies at CrowdStrike, Palo Alto
  Networks, Meta, Google, and more. This role lets you shape
  the future of data security, alongside experts driven to
  help customers protect their most valuable information.
  
  Cyberhaven is committed to creating a diverse environment
  and is an equal opportunity employer. All qualified
  applicants will receive consideration for employment without
