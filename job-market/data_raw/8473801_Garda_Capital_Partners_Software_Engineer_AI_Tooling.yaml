description: |
  Garda Capital Partners (Garda) is a multi-billion dollar
  alternative investment firm with over 22 years of experience
  deploying relative value strategies across fixed income
  markets for institutional investors. Garda's primary offices
  are located in Wayzata, New York City, West Palm Beach,
  Geneva, Zug, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Scottsdale.
  
  Garda is looking to hire a Software Engineer (AI Tooling) to
  be a part of our Research and Technology (R&T) group to
  design and build systems that integrate modern AI
  capabilities across the firm. The selected candidate will
  develop backend services, automation workflows, and
  integrations that help research, trading, and operations
  teams work more effectively with AI-powered tools.
  
  This is a hands-on engineering role focused on building
  practical, production-ready systems—not research or model
  training. You'll work with LLM APIs, build internal
  applications, create automation workflows, and integrate AI
  capabilities into existing systems. The ideal candidate is
  excited about the potential of AI tools but wants to focus
  on engineering and delivery rather than ML research.
  Experience in financial services or capital markets is
  strongly preferred.
  
  Position Responsibilities
  
  - Build internal applications and services that integrate LLM
    APIs and other AI capabilities into firm workflows
  - Develop backend infrastructure for AI-powered tools (API
    gateways, vector search, chat backends, monitoring)
  - Create automation workflows and integrations between AI
    platforms and internal systems
  - Implement data processing pipelines that prepare and route
    information to AI services
  - Work with stakeholders across trading, research, and
    operations to understand requirements and gather feedback
  - Build and maintain integrations with vendor AI platforms and
    third-party tools
  - Participate in design, development, testing, and deployment
    of new features and systems
  - Support and improve existing AI-powered applications and
    workflows
  - Collaborate with infrastructure teams to ensure solutions
    are secure, scalable, and well-monitored
  
  Qualifications & Desired Skills
  
  - Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Engineering,
    Mathematics, Finance, or related field
  - 2-5 years of software engineering experience
  - Strong programming skills in Python (primary language for
    this role) or ability to learn quickly
  - Experience building backend services, APIs, or internal
    applications
  - Comfortable working with REST APIs, databases, and data
    processing workflows
  - Interest in AI and modern development tools; no ML/deep
    learning experience required
  - Understanding of fixed income, trading operations, or
    investment management workflows is a plus
  - Capital markets experience strongly preferred
  - Strong problem-solving skills and ability to learn new
    technologies quickly
  - Clear communication skills and comfort working with both
    technical and non-technical stakeholders
  - Ability to work effectively in a fast-paced environment and
    manage multiple priorities
  - Self-motivated with interest in building practical tools
    that people actually use
  
  This role is also eligible for other forms of compensation
  and benefits, such as a discretionary bonus, healthcare
  plan, 401(k) matching program, etc. Within the range,
  individual pay is determined by work location and additional
  factors, such as job-related skills, experience, and
  relevant education.
  
  Base Salary for this role is expected to be between:
  
  $150,000—$200,000 USD
