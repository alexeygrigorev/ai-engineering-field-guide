  Job Summary:
  
  Drata is advancing the frontier of compliance automation by
  integrating intelligent AI capabilities into its platform.
  We are seeking a Senior AI Engineer to help design, build,
  and scale robust, high-impact AI systems that improve
  operational efficiency, enhance decision-making, and support
  trust-critical enterprise workflows.
  
  This role focuses on solving complex, real-world problems
  with agentic AI, LLMs, and intelligent reasoning systems,
  including automating questionnaire answering and other
  compliance-related workflows. You will work on creating
  generalizable AI solutions that can be applied across
  multiple products and domains, collaborating with cross-
  functional teams to bring cutting-edge research into
  production-ready systems.
  
  As a Senior AI Engineer, you will own the end-to-end design,
  implementation, and evolution of AI-driven systems embedded
  directly into Drata’s core platform. Your work will focus on
  building generalizable, reusable AI capabilities rather than
  one-off features, enabling multiple product surfaces and
  workflows across compliance and security.
  
  What you'll do:
  
  Build Agentic & Intelligent AI Systems
  
  - Design and implement LLM-powered systems capable of multi-
    step reasoning, evidence grounding, and decision support
    in high-trust domains.
  - Develop agentic workflows that combine retrieval, tool use,
    structured reasoning, and human oversight.
  - Create interactive AI experiences that allow users to engage
    naturally with complex compliance and risk data.
  
  Automated Reasoning Over Regulations & Evidence
  
  - Build AI systems that reason over structured and
    unstructured data to support regulatory interpretation,
    control alignment, and evidence validation.
  - Ensure AI outputs are traceable, explainable, and auditable,
    meeting the expectations of enterprise customers and
    auditors.
  
  Production-Grade AI Architecture
  
  - Architect and deploy scalable LLM + retrieval + agent
    systems in production environments.
  - Optimize for latency, cost, reliability, and evaluation in
    real-world enterprise workloads.
  - Partner with platform, security, product teams, and other
    application development teams with diverse skill sets to
    operationalize AI safely and effectively.
  
  Responsible & Trustworthy AI
  
  - Embed human-in-the-loop workflows, confidence thresholds,
    and safety guardrails into AI systems.
  - Ensure privacy-preserving data handling, robust failure
    modes, and transparent behavior aligned with Drata’s trust
    principles.
  
  What you'll bring:
  
  - Experience: 7+ years of hands-on software engineering
    experience; 2+ years specifically in ML/AI engineering.
  - Programming Languages: Proficiency in Python; TypeScript
    experience is a plus, especially for production AI system
    integrations.
  - Retrieval & Vector Stores: Familiarity with vector databases
    (Pinecone, Chroma, FAISS, etc.) and RAG system design.
  - LLM & AI Systems: Proven experience building and shipping
    LLM-based applications in production, including
    embeddings, RAG, agent frameworks, prompt engineering, and
    evaluation.
  - Production Expertise: Track record of taking AI systems from
    concept to production, designing scalable, maintainable
    solutions.
  - Problem Solving: Ability to decompose complex tasks into
    agentic workflows and reason over high-stakes, structured,
    and unstructured data.
  - Collaboration: Experience working cross-functionally with
    product, compliance, security, engineering teams, and
    partnering with other application development teams with
    diverse skill sets.
  
  Bonus Qualifications:
  
  - Experience in compliance, security, risk, or audit domains.
  - Familiarity with Snowflake-based analytics, knowledge
    graphs, or enterprise data platforms.
  - Experience partnering with non-technical stakeholders such
    as compliance or GRC teams.
  
  This role defines how AI is responsibly embedded into a
  trust-critical enterprise platform. Your work will:
  
  - Establish foundational agentic AI capabilities that power
    multiple present and future product experiences.
  - Enable customers to derive accurate, explainable insights
    from complex compliance and security data.
  - Set the technical and ethical standard for applying modern
    AI in regulated, high-stakes environments.

  advantage—and we prove it with support that exceeds industry
  standards. Our total rewards package is designed to power
  your well-being, accelerate your growth, and keep your work-
  life balance thriving.
