  Overview
  
  We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer with a passion
  for AI to join us in our mission of bringing the ION Factory
  OS to next-generation hardware builders around the globe.
  This role is based in Los Angeles, CA (HQ in El Segundo).
  
  Are you excited by the opportunity to build AI-powered
  software that accelerates the development of eVTOLs,
  rockets, robots, and autonomous vehicles?
  
  Responsibilities & Duties
  
  - Lead the design, implementation, and optimization of
    production-ready AI systems within the ION Factory OS.
  - Ship customer-facing features that directly impact
    manufacturing workflows, including AI-driven functionality
    (e.g., generative procedure creation, anomaly detection,
    recommendations) and core product features not reliant on
    AI.
  - Architect and maintain scalable software systems, including
    AI/ML pipelines and broader product infrastructure.
  - Design and implement AI features using retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG) pipelines to deliver context-aware
    insights and recommendations.
  - Leverage Model Context Protocol (MCP) and similar frameworks
    to connect AI models seamlessly with
    structured/unstructured data sources and external tools.
  - Collaborate with product managers and customers to translate
    real-world challenges into robust software solutions.
  - Partner with data engineering to process and transform
    structured and unstructured manufacturing data into usable
    formats.
  - Ensure reliability, scalability, and maintainability of all
    systems in production, leveraging CI/CD and cloud-native
    workflows.
  - Stay ahead of advancements in software engineering and AI,
    bringing the best practices into shipped product features.
  - Mentor junior engineers and help raise the technical bar
    across the team.
  
  Minimum Qualifications & Skills
  
  - 7+ years of professional software engineering experience,
    including 3+ years shipping AI/ML-powered products into
    production.
  - Proven track record of building and shipping customer-facing
    applications (AI and non-AI) that deliver measurable
    business value.
  - Experience architecting scalable systems on cloud platforms
    (AWS, Azure, GCP).
  - Expertise in data modeling, preprocessing, and model
    evaluation at scale.
  - Familiarity with generative AI models (LLMs, diffusion
    models, GANs) and their real-world applications.
  - Strong knowledge of APIs and modern software design patterns
    for integrating AI into SaaS products.
  - Excellent problem-solving, communication, and cross-
    functional collaboration skills.
  - Passion for AI innovation paired with the ability to deliver
    non-AI product functionality when needed.
  
  Desired Qualifications
  
  - Experience building AI systems for real-time, low-latency,
    or edge deployments.
  - Familiarity with modern data governance, privacy, and
    compliance standards (SOC2, GDPR, ITAR).
  - Hands-on experience with retrieval-augmented generation
    (RAG) for building AI systems that combine large language
    models with external knowledge sources.
  - Understanding of and/or experience with Model Context
    Protocol (MCP) or similar emerging standards for
    connecting AI systems with data and tools.
  - Customer-facing experience gathering requirements,
    presenting solutions, and demonstrating value.
  - Contributions to open-source projects or published research
    in applied AI/ML.
  - Experience mentoring engineers and contributing to
    engineering best practices.
  
  Benefits & Perks
  
  - Health Insurance; medical, vision, dental, & life insurance.
  - Paid Parental Leave.
  - Employee Stock Option Plan.
  - Team outings, group lunches, open office, happy hours.
  - Paid holidays, sick days.
  - Flexible Friday and PTO.
  - 401K.
