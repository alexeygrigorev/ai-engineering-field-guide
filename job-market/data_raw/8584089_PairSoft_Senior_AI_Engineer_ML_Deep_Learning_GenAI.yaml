  Senior AI Engineer (ML / Deep Learning / GenAI) Location:
  India Job Type: Full-time, Remote Experience Level:
  4+yrs(Hands-on IC) About the Role We are looking for a
  Senior AI Engineer to help us turn complex, time-consuming
  workflows into AI capabilities that customers can trust and
  use in day-to-day operations. The work spans classical
  machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI. You’ll
  be hands-on across the full lifecycle: shaping the solution,
  building or configuring models, deploying and keeping them
  healthy through retraining and strong observability as data
  and usage evolve. What makes this role especially
  interesting is the “last mile”: taking AI features beyond a
  single implementation and making them work repeatedly across
  customers. You’ll help harden the patterns that enable
  secure, reliable, and measurable multi-customer deployments,
  backed by practical guardrails and evaluation so quality
  holds up as usage grows. This role is supported by and
  collaborates closely with DevOps/MLOps and Data/AI
  Architecture to deliver production outcomes and establish
  repeatable standards as the team scales significantly over
  time. Most of this runs on Azure today, with room to explore
  OCI as our platform evolves. Key Responsibilities
  
  - Build and deliver AI solutions using ML/DL and GenAI
    services based on problem needs.
  - Develop and maintain pipelines for training, evaluation,
    deployment, monitoring, and retraining.
  - Build GenAI applications (e.g., RAG/agents) with strong
    evaluation and guardrails.
  - Deploy AI workloads for real-time inference and/or batch
    processing.
  - Implement automated retraining (scheduling/triggers,
    validation, versioning, rollout).
  - Scale GenAI-enabled solutions so multiple customers can use
    them safely and reliably, with multi-tenant controls,
    guardrails, evaluation, and tuning
  - Set up model observability: performance metrics, drift
    detection, data quality checks, alerting, and production
    troubleshooting.
  - Partner with engineering and platform teams to integrate
    solutions into production and CI/CD workflows.
  
  Requirements
  
  - 5+ years overall experience in AI/ML engineering, including
    2+ years with GenAI/LLM systems.
  - Strong proficiency in Python for model development,
    automation, and production-grade services.
  - Experience building GenAI applications (e.g., RAG/agents)
    with evaluation and guardrails.
  - Proven experience running models in production with
    monitoring, retraining, and observability practices.
  - Hands-on experience with Azure (Azure ML preferred); OCI
    exposure is a plus.
  - Experience with MLOps practices/tools such as MLflow and
    CI/CD pipelines.
  - Hands-on experience deploying AI services on Azure using
    Azure App Service and Azure Container Apps, with
    monitoring via Application Insights.
  - Experience containerizing services using Docker in
    production environments.
  - Hands-on experience with orchestration using Apache Airflow
    (open-source) or Azure-native alternatives (Azure Data
    Factory / Azure ML pipelines).
  - Working knowledge of scalable service design (latency/cost
    optimization, caching, batching, rate limiting).
  - Experience with deep learning frameworks (PyTorch or
    TensorFlow) is a plus.
  
  Strong communication skills and ability to work effectively
  in a collaborative environment. What We Offer
  
  
  - Opportunity to grow your career with a rapidly growing
    organisation.
  - Exposure to working with a Microsoft gold partner
    organization with the latest technologies.
  - People first organisation culture
  - Company Paid Group Mediclaim Insurance for employee, spouse
    and up to 2 Kids of INR 400,000 per annum
  - Company Paid Group Personal accidental insurance for
    employees of INR 1,000,000 per annum.
  - Company Paid & Manager approved Career Advancement
    Opportunities
  - Best in the Industry referral bonus policy.
