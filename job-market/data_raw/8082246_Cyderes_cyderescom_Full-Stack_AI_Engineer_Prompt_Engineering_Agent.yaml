  - Build and maintain embeddings, feature pipelines, telemetry,
    and drift detection.
  - Perform data analysis and experimentation using KQL and
    Splunk SPL.
  - Support model selection, fine-tuning strategies, safety
    constraints, and evaluation frameworks.
  - Translate ambiguous business needs into measurable AI
    workflows.
  - Partner with security, engineering, and product teams.
  - Produce clear documentation (architecture, prompts,
    runbooks).
  - Act as an internal SME for agentic systems and modern AI
    development patterns.
