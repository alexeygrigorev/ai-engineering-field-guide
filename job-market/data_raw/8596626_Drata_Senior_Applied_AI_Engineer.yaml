  Job Summary:
  
  Drata, at the vanguard of compliance software innovation and
  renowned for its commitment to trust and security across the
  internet, is on an ambitious path to redefine how AI and
  General AI technologies bolster compliance automation.
  
  Drata is seeking an Applied AI Engineer to drive the quality
  and effectiveness of our AI systems through rigorous
  research, experimentation, and evaluation. In this role, you
  will optimize retrieval strategies, build evaluation
  frameworks, and establish the scientific foundation that
  enables our AI features to deliver accurate, trustworthy
  results.
  
  This is a research-focused role emphasizing experimentation
  and rigor over production engineering. You'll work closely
  with AI Engineers handing off validated approaches for them
  to productionize while owning the quality metrics and
  evaluation systems that ensure our AI delivers on its
  promises.
  
  Drata's compliance platform is document-heavy: VRM Agent,
  AIQA, Trust Agent, policy-to-control mappers, and regulatory
  summarization all depend on retrieving the right information
  from large document sets. Your work will directly impact how
  well our AI understands and navigates compliance artifacts.
  
  Location: While we’re ideally looking for someone who can
  join us in a hybrid capacity from our San Francisco office,
  we know great talent isn’t limited by zip code. We’ll
  consider remote candidates across the U.S. who are a strong
  match for the role.
  
  What you'll do:
  
  - Design and evaluate information access + reasoning
    strategies across RAG, agents, and classic ML: chunking,
    embedding models, hybrid search, metadata filtering,
    structured retrieval, tool use, and multi-step workflows
  - Prototype GenAI workflows (including agentic systems) that
    map and reason over compliance objects (controls ↔ risks ↔
    requirements)
  - Explore ML + probabilistic approaches where GenAI is not the
    best fit: classifiers, ranking models, graph/link
    prediction, calibration, and weak supervision
  - Build and maintain evaluation frameworks: golden datasets,
    automated quality metrics, regression detection
  - Implement and tune ranking/reranking systems: cross-
    encoders, LLM-based rerankers, learning-to-rank, custom
    scoring functions
  - Run experiments to validate hypotheses and quantify
    improvements before production rollout
  - Debug failure modes and build error taxonomies across
    retrieval, reasoning, and generation
  - Collaborate with AI and Software Engineers to hand off
    validated approaches for productionization
  - Stay current on applied research in RAG, agents, LLM
    evaluation, and relevance modeling; bring innovations into
    the product
  
  What you'll bring:
  
  - 6+ years of experience in applied research, data science, or
    ML with a focus on NLP, information retrieval, or
    knowledge systems
  - 2+ years of hands-on experience building or contributing to
    production AI/ML systems
  - Strong foundation in information retrieval: dense and sparse
    retrieval, embedding models, search relevance
  - Experience with RAG systems: chunking strategies, vector
    databases, retrieval optimization
  - Proficiency in evaluation methodology: metrics design,
    golden dataset creation, A/B testing, statistical analysis
  - Strong Python skills and comfort with notebook-driven
    research workflows
  - Experience communicating research findings to engineering
    teams and translating insights into actionable
    recommendations
  - Bonus: Experience with compliance, legal, or document-heavy
    domains
  - Bonus: Publications or contributions in IR, NLP, or RAG
    evaluation
  
  Your contributions at Drata will not only shape the future
  of compliance and security automation but also solidify our
  standing as an innovator in the space, driving forward our
  mission with cutting-edge technology.
  
  How we support you: At Drata, our people are our strongest
  advantage—and we prove it with support that exceeds industry
  standards. Our total rewards package is designed to power
  your well-being, accelerate your growth, and keep your work-
  life balance thriving.

  - Shared Success: We provide stock equity to ensure that as
    the company grows, you share directly in that success.
    Equity gives every employee a sense of ownership and the
    opportunity to celebrate our wins together—because your
    contributions don’t just support our progress; they help
    drive our collective success.
  - Health & Wellness: Up to 100% employer-paid premiums for
    medical, dental, and vision coverage for employees and
    their dependents, along with comprehensive wellness

    work, you should get the time you need for rest,
    rejuvenation and recovery. Drata offers a flexible
    vacation policy, paid holidays, and other perks to
    recharge.
