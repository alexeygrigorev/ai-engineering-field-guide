  About the role:
  
  Forter is looking for a Senior Software AI Engineer to join
  a strong and dynamic AI Engineering team. We are the focal
  point for AI initiatives in Forter, striving to constantly
  bring innovation and leverage AI capabilities across all
  company teams and products.
  
  Today, AI is central to how Forter operates, across the
  entire organization. It allows us to move fast and release
  features at a rapid pace, empowers non-technical Forterians
  to utilize AI tools for increased efficiency, and provides
  the backdrop for much of the innovation currently occurring
  in the company.
  
  If this kind of working environment sounds exciting to you,
  if you understand that Engineering is about building the
  most effective and elegant solution within a given set of
  constraints - consider applying for this position.
  
  Why should you join us?
  
  This is a great opportunity to be at the cutting edge of the
  AI revolution, helping to shape and build the AI platform
  for the future. Together, we’ll build infrastructure for
  autonomous and interactive agents, enact AI guardrails and
  evaluation frameworks to ensure performance and safety, and
  implement state-of-the-art AI and Agentic patterns.
  
  This role presents a unique opportunity to enter the AI
  domain. For those with some experience in AI infrastructure,
  it offers the chance to grow within a team that is evolving
  Forter from the AI experimentation phase to building and
  leveraging AI-powered products.
  
  What you will be doing:
  
  - Design, build, and maintain reusable AI capabilities -
    including models, tools, APIs, and platforms that power
    both internal and customer-facing solutions.
  - Develop and maintain our internal MCP server that easily and
    securely exposes Forter’s vast data stores to AI agents.
  - Create and implement robust evaluation frameworks and AI
    guardrails to safeguard Forter’s value and ensure model
    reliability.
  - Establish deep expertise and sustainable AI engineering
    practices.
  - Promote AI readiness and track adoption across the company
    to build lasting impact.
  - Build and optimize RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
    systems.
  - Take full ownership of projects: from gathering requirements
    from non-technical internal users to development,
    deployment, and operation.
  - Act as a consultant and advocate for AI engineering, helping
    other teams leverage the platforms and tools you build.
  - Partner with teams across Forter to accelerate AI adoption
    and productization efforts.
  
  Who are you?
  
  - 5+ years of strong backend and server-side development
    experience, building complex, highly scalable systems.
  - Proven experience with at least one general-purpose language
    (preferably Python, but not a must).
  - Strong product management skills, with the ability to gather
    and refine requirements from non-technical internal users.
  - A strong sense of ownership, with some DevOps experience and
    a willingness to develop, deploy, and run projects end-to-
    end.
  - Strong familiarity with AI coding tools like Copilot,
    Cursor, or similar.
  - Experience working with public clouds (AWS / GCP / Azure).
  - Fluent in written and spoken English.
  
  It’d be really cool if you also:
  
  - Are familiar with agentic coding tools like Claude code or
    Copilot CLI.
  - Have familiarity with Strands Agents (or similar agentic
    technologies), RAGs, and Bedrock.
  - Have experience with MCP (Model Context Protocol).
  - Are comfortable in a containerized environment.
  
  Benefits include:
  
  - Competitive salary and bonus plan
  - Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)
  - Private health insurance, including vision and dental
    coverage
  - Generous PTO policy
  - Half day Fridays, every Friday
