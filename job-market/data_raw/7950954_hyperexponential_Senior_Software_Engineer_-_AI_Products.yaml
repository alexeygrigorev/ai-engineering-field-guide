  About hyperexponential (hx)
  
  At hyperexponential, we’re building the AI-powered platform
  that enables the world’s most critical decisions in a $7
  trillion industry, which risks to take, and how to price
  them. These are the decisions that shape real-world
  outcomes: whether rockets successfully launch into space,
  autonomous vehicles make it to market, or communities
  recover after major storms.
  
  Until now, insurance has been making billion-dollar
  decisions using outdated tools. We’re changing that. Our
  platform brings together data, AI, and human expertise to
  give insurers the fastest path from submission to decision -
  helping them move faster, act smarter, and take on more risk
  with confidence.
  
  Backed by a16z, Highland Europe, and Battery Ventures, we’re
  scaling globally - already trusted by nearly 50 of the
  world’s largest insurers, with zero churn and billions in
  premiums flowing through hx.
  
  What began as a single product in one market has rapidly
  evolved into a multi-product, multi-territory platform
  powering every stage of pricing and underwriting. AI is at
  the core of what we do - from building the world’s first
  domain-specific AI peer programmer for insurance (think
  GitHub Copilot with a PhD in actuarial science) to shaping
  agentic workflows that reinvent how this industry operates.
  
  What makes hx different is the people who build it. Here,
  impact isn’t tied to title or tenure; it’s defined by the
  challenges you take on and the discipline you bring.
  Surrounded by peers who stretch you, you’ll do the best,
  hardest work of your life in a company engineered to endure.
  
  If that sounds like you, join us in building what comes
  next.
  
  About the hxAI team
  
  At hx, AI is not an add-on, it is central to our mission. We
  are redefining how the insurance industry builds software
  and makes decisions, powered by generative AI. Our team
  combines state-of-the-art LLM technology with deep insurance
  domain expertise to solve problems no one else is tackling.
  
  We’re currently focused on two flagship products. The first
  is a powerful ingestion engine that transforms unstructured
  insurance documents into structured insights. The second is
  our crown jewel: a domain-specific AI peer-programmer
  embedded inside a custom IDE, designed to reshape how
  actuaries and underwriters code, model risk, and make
  billion-dollar decisions.
  
  This is applied AI with teeth. Our team moves fast,
  experiments often, and ships real value into the hands of
  customers. You’ll join a small, high-ownership group with
  the autonomy to drive innovation and directly influence how
  AI transforms an entire industry.
  
  What you’ll be doing
  
  - Architect and scale advanced AI and ML systems that power
    hx’s next generation of products - solving problems where
    no off-the-shelf solution exists.
  - Lead the design and deployment of cutting-edge model
    capabilities, from LLM-driven workflows to domain-specific
    ML pipelines optimised for messy, high-value real-world
    data.
  - Drive foundational decisions across data, modelling, and
    production infrastructure to ensure performance,
    robustness, and long-term scalability of our AI platform.
  - Rapidly prototype novel ideas, validate them in live
    environments, and evolve successful experiments into
    production-grade systems used by customers at scale.
  - Advance hx’s broader AI strategy: shaping technical
    direction, embedding best practices, and raising the bar
    for how we build, test, and ship ML-powered features.
  - Act as a technical multiplier: mentoring engineers,
    cultivating deep ML craftsmanship, and fostering a culture
    anchored in curiosity, speed, and scientific rigor.
  
  What you’ll need to have done
  
  - Built and operated production-grade ML products in Python,
    with deep expertise across software development, model
    development, data processing, evaluation, and
    optimisation.
  - Designed and scaled distributed, cloud-native pipelines -
    bringing clarity and structure to ambiguous real-world
    data challenges.
  - Taken full ownership of impactful AI initiatives: from
    identifying the opportunity, to modelling, to deploying
    and measuring value in production.
  - Communicated complex ML concepts clearly and persuasively
    across engineering, product, and business teams.
  - Influenced technical direction and culture, translating
    local wins into durable engineering practices.
  - Delivered AI/ML-powered products end-to-end, balancing rapid
    experimentation with the demands of high-reliability
    production systems.
  - (Nice to have) Brought LLMs into production, especially for
    NLP-heavy or retrieval-augmented use cases.
  
  You’re unlikely to thrive here if
  
  - You prefer predefined playbooks and predictable projects
    over ambiguous, exploratory work.
  - You see your contribution as limited to code, rather than
    shaping products and systems end-to-end.
  - You’re uncomfortable with rapid iteration and
    experimentation in live environments.
  
  If reading our Culture Document leaves you feeling neutral
  rather than energised, hx may not be the place where you’ll
  do your best work. We’re building something that asks for
  commitment and conviction, and we want you to feel excited
  by the opportunity to grow with us.
  
  Compensation
  
  At hx, we’re committed to salary transparency. You’ll always
  have clarity on pay early in the process - our Talent
  Partner will share details with you during initial
  conversations - and we’re working towards publishing salary
  information for all roles globally.
  
  Because we’re building at the intersection of
  technology/SaaS and insurance, our roles don’t always map
  neatly onto traditional benchmarks. Our approach is to
  design compensation that’s competitive in the market, fair
  across teams, and aligned with the impact our people make.
  
  Equity: We offer equity across all roles at hx, making it a
  significant component of total compensation. Your talent
  partner will be able to share more details about this.
