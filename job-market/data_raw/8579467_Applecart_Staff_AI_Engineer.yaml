description: |
  Applecart is the leading technology company that C-suites
  rely on to reach business-critical decision makers. The most
  important decisions are made by the hardest people to reach
  and influence. Historically, C-suite leaders have lacked the
  tools to reach the stakeholders who matter most to their
  business. The C-suites of hundreds of Fortune 500 companies,
  major agencies, trade associations, nonprofits, and
  governments use Applecart to put their best content in front
  of business-critical decision makers and those they trust —
  from policymakers and investors to CEOs, key employees,
  members of the media and more. Decision makers are informed
  by what they read, learn from advisors, hear from
  colleagues, and discuss with family and friends. To break
  through to them, you must reach them through the only
  channel that really moves them: those they know and trust.
  Applecart’s platform uses publicly available data to map
  billions of social relationships between nearly every
  American adult and enable clients to deliver content
  directly to decision makers and those who matter most to
  them.
