description: |
  At Arctic Wolf, we're redefining the cybersecurity
  landscape. With our employee Pack members spread across the
  globe, we’re committed to setting new industry standards.
  Our accomplishments speak for themselves — from recognition
  in the Forbes Cloud 100, CNBC Disruptor 50, Fortune Future
  50, and Fortune Cyber 60, to winning the 2024 CRN Products
  of the Year award. We’re proud to be named a Leader in the
  IDC MarketScape for Worldwide Managed Detection and Response
  Services and to have earned a Customers' Choice distinction
  from Gartner Peer Insights. Join a company that’s not only
  leading, but also shaping the future of security operations
  and customer engagement.
  
  Our mission is simple: End Cyber Risk.
  
  About the Role
  
  We are building a next-generation integration authoring
  platform to scale ingestion development for a rapidly
  growing customer base. As integration demand continues to
  increase, developing new integrations today requires
  significant end-to-end effort. This role is part of a
  strategic initiative to reduce integration development time
  through declarative, schema-driven authoring for REST-based
  ingestions. The long-term vision is to enable customers to
  self-author ingestions for bespoke or unsupported
  integrations, with system design guided by future LLM-driven
  automation.
  
  We’re looking for a Senior Software Developer – AI
  Integrations who will work on Python-based backend systems,
  design declarative schemas, and help lay the foundation for
  LLM-assisted integration generation.
  
  About the Role
  
  - Develop, test, and deploy backend automation systems that
    enhance SOC workflows using cloud-native, data-intensive,
    and AI-driven architectures.
  - Design, develop, and maintain backend services and
    microservices using Python, Go, and scalable cloud-native
    patterns.
  - Build secure, high-availability systems leveraging AWS
    services including RDS, DynamoDB, Lambda, and
    Kubernetes/EKS.
  - Build and maintain detection pipelines, incident response
    playbooks, enrichment services, and agentic automation
    systems.
  - Integrate software components into robust, production-ready
    systems with strong observability, documentation, and
    maintainability.
  - Collaborate closely with threat detection, incident
    response, data science, and platform engineering teams to
    deliver secure, reliable, and context-aware automation
    capabilities.
  - Apply test-driven development and CI/CD practices using Git,
    Jenkins, Terraform, Docker, and infrastructure-as-code
    workflows.
  - Contribute to architectural discussions on integrating LLMs,
    reasoning agents, and autonomous task execution frameworks
    into SOC tooling.
  - Solve complex problems creatively using advanced analytical
    and debugging techniques across distributed systems.
  - Explore and prototype innovative uses of AI in detection,
    triage, automation, and response workflows.
  - Mentor junior developers and contribute to team growth
    through knowledge sharing and technical leadership.
  
  About You
  
  - 5+ years of experience in backend software development,
    infrastructure engineering, or security-focused systems.
  - Strong understanding of automation design patterns,
    distributed systems, and cloud-native application design.
  - Experience building large-scale, production-grade backend
    systems using Python, Go, or similar languages.
  - Familiarity with AWS (preferred), GCP, or Azure, along with
    strong knowledge of CI/CD pipelines and DevOps tooling.
  - Hands-on experience with Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and
    microservices architectures.
  - Experience integrating or building systems with AI/ML
    components and automation in production environments.
  - Strong understanding of data pipelines, streaming systems,
    or detection workflows.
  - Proven ability to work independently on large features and
    contribute to architectural decisions.
  - Strong problem-solving mindset with the ability to translate
    SOC and security goals into scalable technical solutions.
  - Passion for working in fast-moving, mission-driven
    environments where security, AI, and engineering
    excellence meet.
