  About FLORA
  
  We build creative tools for the new creative class—an
  intelligent canvas where the best AI models enable
  professional craft. We're a team of ~20, backed by
  exceptional investors like Hanabi Capital, Menlo Ventures,
  Justin Kan, and Gabe Whaley (founder of MSCHF). Our
  customers span a variety of creative industries and include
  Pentagram, Lionsgate, and Nike.
  
  We’re looking to bring on an Applied AI Engineer who will
  architect and build the agentic systems powering FLORA.
  
  As part of the founding team, you will work closely with the
  founders to invent how creative professionals interact with
  AI in a generative age. This is a first-principles role:
  you’ll design, implement, and scale the backbone of agentic
  workflows that let creatives orchestrate text, image, and
  video models seamlessly on FLORA’s infinite canvas.
  
  What You’ll Do As an Applied AI Engineer, you’ll design and
  build the intelligence layer of FLORA — systems that make
  multi-modal creative workflows powerful, reliable, and
  intuitive. You’ll work on problems at the intersection of
  AI, orchestration, and interaction design: bringing together
  text, image, and video models into seamless workflows that
  creatives can actually trust and enjoy using.
  
  You’ll collaborate across product, infra, and design to
  build agentic features that let creatives speak their idea
  into existence while maintaining control.
  
  Requirements
  
  - Hands-on experience building agentic systems — e.g. multi-
    step pipelines, tool-using agents, assistants with memory,
    or similar.
  - Familiarity with evaluation frameworks (automated checks,
    regression testing, human-in-the-loop scoring) to ensure
    system reliability.
  - Experience with memory and retrieval (vector DBs,
    embeddings, summarization, context management).
  - Strong background in orchestration across models, APIs, and
    tools — including handling retries, fallbacks, and edge
    cases.
  - Comfortable reasoning about multi-modal workflows (text,
    image, video) and their integration in a user-facing
    product.
  - Ability to work across the stack (frontend, backend, infra)
    and collaborate closely with product and design.
  - Product-minded — you care as much about usability and
    creative control as you do about technical novelty.
  - 3+ years of engineering experience
  - Bonus: experience with creative tools, generative models, or
    node-based interfaces.
