description: |
  Axiad is an identity security company tackling the critical
  threats posed by compromised credentials, which account for
  over 70% of enterprise breaches.  As human and non-human
  identities multiply across disparate systems, traditional
  IAM tools fall short, leaving organizations with fragmented
  visibility and significant security gaps.
  
  Axiad bridges this divide by uncovering hidden identity
  risks and credential vulnerabilities, providing actionable
  insights to strengthen security—without requiring a complete
  system overhaul.  Our solutions integrate seamlessly with
  existing IAM infrastructures, enabling organizations to
  shrink their attack surface and adopt phishing-resistant,
  strong authentication methods.
  
  At Axiad, we make identity security simple, effective, and
  real for a passwordless, more secure world.  Discover more
