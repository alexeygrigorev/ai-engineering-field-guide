  Senior AI/ML Engineer
  
  Remote US | Full-Time
  
  We’re looking for an exceptional Senior AI Engineer with 4+
  years of software engineering experience and a proven track
  record delivering Generative AI solutions to join Modus’s
  Engineering Consulting team.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  No two days look the same in this role. You might spend one
  day whiteboarding an architecture with a client, the next
  drafting a proposal for a new engagement, and the next deep
  in code shipping an LLM-powered feature. As a senior
  engineer on our consulting team, you'll move fluidly
  between:
  
  - Designing and building AI solutions: scoping, architecting,
    and implementing applications powered by generative AI,
    from proof of concept to production deployment.
  - Working directly with clients: understanding their problems,
    proposing solutions, and translating business needs into
    technical plans. You're the trusted technical advisor in
    the room.
  - Hands-on engineering: writing production-quality code,
    integrating LLMs and ML models into real systems, and
    deploying them to the cloud.
  - Collaborating across disciplines:  partnering with cloud
    architects, DevOps specialists, and front-end developers
    to deliver end-to-end solutions.
  - Supporting business development — contributing to proposals,
    scoping engagements, and supporting sales and marketing
    efforts when needed.
  
  About You
  
  You're an engineer who thrives in client-facing environments
  and can own problems end-to-end, from a vague business need
  to a working system in production.
  
  Your core strength is deploying and operationalizing AI. You
  have hands-on experience deploying large and small language
  models (LLMs/SLMs) in the cloud and on-premises, and you're
  comfortable with techniques like prompt engineering,
  retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), fine-tuning, and
  agentic architectures (tool use, multi-agent orchestration,
  human-in-the-loop workflows). You understand how to evaluate
  model outputs and build reliable systems around inherently
  probabilistic components.
  
  Familiarity with classical ML (prediction, classification)
  and data science fundamentals is a desirable plus. A
  background in cloud services for machine learning, text
  extraction, speech recognition, or computer vision will
  broaden the engagements you can contribute to.
  
  Proficiency in Python is a must. Experience with other
  programming languages like Java, Scala, Rust or R is highly
  desirable, as it will enable you to work on a broader range
  of engagements.
  
  You’ll work side by side with cloud architects, DevOps
  specialists and front-end developers, so some knowledge and
  experience in any of these would help in collaboration.
  
  You should be comfortable presenting work to both technical
  and non-technical audiences, driving alignment with
  stakeholders and between technical and business outcomes,
  leading technical teams and cross-collaborating with teams
  in adjacent domains. Experience in supporting sales and
  marketing efforts is a desirable plus.
  
  Requirements
  
  - LLM deployment and agentic AI: experience with LLM
    orchestration frameworks (e.g., LangChain, LangGraph,
    Google ADK), agent tooling and protocols (e.g., MCP,
    function calling), and evaluation/observability libraries.
    Cloud deployment of LLM-based applications
  - Cloud AI services: experience with managed AI services such
    as Amazon Bedrock, SageMaker, Rekognition, etc. or
    equivalents on other platforms
  - Machine learning frameworks: familiarity with frameworks
    like TensorFlow or PyTorch is a plus
  - AI-assisted development tools: experience with AI-powered
    coding assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude
    Code) and agentic coding workflows
  - Cloud platforms: solid experience with at least one major
    cloud provider (AWS preferred); infrastructure as code
    (e.g., Terraform) is a plus
  - Version control and DevOps: Git, GitHub/GitLab; DevOps and
    CI/CD experience is a big plus
  - Programming and scripting languages: Python, Bash; knowledge
    of other languages is a plus
  - Data storage and querying: SQL and NoSQL databases
  
  Above all, AI is a rapidly-evolving field so the curiosity
  and drive to keep learning matter as much as what you
  already know.
