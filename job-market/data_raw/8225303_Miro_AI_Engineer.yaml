  About the Team
  
  Miro is on a mission to empower teams to create the next big
  thing, and our teams are at the forefront of making that
  vision a reality. Our teams drive AI-powered innovation
  across Miro's platform by building robust technical
  foundations, delightful product features, and intelligent
  capabilities that transform how users interact with content
  on the canvas. Whether developing structured widget
  capabilities that help users visualize and interact with
  complex information, building AI platform infrastructure, or
  creating intelligent features that anticipate user needs,
  our work is foundational to Miro's evolution.
  
  About the Role
  
  As an AI Engineer, you'll design and build AI-driven
  capabilities that enhance how users create, transform, and
  collaborate on canvas. You'll bridge AI innovation and
  product delivery - shipping delightful, safe, and reliable
  experiences that leverage cutting-edge LLMs while
  maintaining the performance and polish users expect from
  Miro's collaborative canvas.
  
  What you’ll do
  
  - Design, develop, and ship AI-driven capabilities—including
    agents, intelligent assistants, context-aware prediction,
    and generative AI—using Python, top-tier LLMs, TypeScript,
    React, Canvas, and WebGL
  - Engineer high-performing AI workflows leveraging LLMs
    (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini), prompt
    engineering, and generative techniques—ensuring
    reliability, scalability, and maintainability
  - Execute end-to-end AI projects from conceptualization and
    prototyping to production code, collaborating closely with
    product managers, designers, and engineers
  - Experiment and iterate on AI capabilities within your team
    domain, staying ahead of emerging AI tools, frameworks,
    and techniques
  - Champion best practices in AI system development—including
    evaluations, LLMOps, CI/CD, observability, and ethical AI
    principles
  - Measure and optimize AI performance, establishing benchmarks
    for user engagement, model accuracy, latency, error rate,
    and drift
  - Write clean, well-tested, maintainable code, participating
    in code reviews and® technical discussions across the
    stream
  - Troubleshoot and resolve production issues, ensuring high
    availability and performance
  
  What you’ll need
  
  - 3+ years of professional experience with a proven track
    record delivering AI-first capabilities in customer-facing
    products—driving value through features users directly
    interact with
  - Excellent communication skills, able to translate complex
    technical concepts for non-technical stakeholders
  - Strong Python skills and familiarity with FE technologies
    (e.g. Typescript, React etc)
  - Demonstrated expertise in prompt engineering and context
    engineering using top-tier LLMs (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic
    Claude, Google Gemini)
  - Ability to develop high-quality, production-ready code
    within complex codebases
  - Experience with LLM evaluation frameworks and a track record
    of building evals that meaningfully inform model
    selection, prompt iteration, or feature quality.
  - Solid understanding of ML fundamentals, including
    probabilistic modeling, evaluation techniques, and deep
    neural networks
  - Experience with LLMOps and cloud services (AWS, Azure,
    Amazon Bedrock, etc.)
  - AI-First Proficiency. We’re building for an AI-first future,
    and we’re looking for graduates who aren’t just using
    AI—they’re mastering it. We’re excited to meet early-
    career engineers who have moved beyond simple chat prompts
    and have truly integrated AI into their development flow.
    Whether it’s using AI agents for autonomous debugging,
    analyzing logs, or rapidly prototyping and shipping
    features to production, we value the ability to "pilot"
    these tools to deliver high-quality code at an ambitious
    pace.
  - Nice-to-have: Experience with rendering technologies like
    WebGL, Canvas API, or 2D graphics libraries (PixiJS, Skia)
  - Nice-to-have: Real-time technologies experience (WebSocket)
  - Nice-to-have: Vector databases, RAG pipelines, LangChain, or
    agent frameworks
  - Nice-to-have: Multi-modal AI or long-context handling
  - Nice-to-have: ML frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging
    Face Transformers
