title: "GTM Systems & AI Engineer"
company: Confluent
location: USA
work_type: FULL_TIME
level: Senior level
description: |
  We’re not just building better tech. We’re rewriting how
  data moves and what the world can do with it. With
  Confluent, data doesn’t sit still. Our platform puts
  information in motion, streaming in near real-time so
  companies can react faster, build smarter, and deliver
  experiences as dynamic as the world around them.
  
  It takes a certain kind of person to join this team. Those
  who ask hard questions, give honest feedback, and show up
  for each other. No egos, no solo acts. Just smart, curious
  humans pushing toward something bigger, together.
  
  One Confluent. One Team. One Data Streaming Platform.
  
  About the Role:
  
  You’ll drive our shift to an AI-first GTM operating model
  across Sales and Customer Success. This role focuses on
  improving GTM execution by removing friction from the
  customer journey, from pipeline generation and deal
  execution through onboarding, adoption, expansion, and
  renewal. You will take real workflow pain from the field and
  translate it into practical, measurable improvements using
  AI agents, automation, and better data flow across systems.
  
  You’ll design and ship solutions using tools like Relevance
  AI, Momentum, Clay, and LLM tooling. You’ll influence GTM AI
  strategy by shipping what works, setting a high bar for
  quality and operational rigor, and creating reusable
  patterns that scale. You’ll own outcomes end-to-end. That
  means turning ambiguous asks into a clear plan, making
  tradeoffs quickly, and shipping measurable improvements on a
  steady cadence. Act as the internal GTM AI Subject Matter
  Expert (SME), promoting responsible AI adoption and
  automation across GTM teams by recommending effective
  patterns, tooling, and best practices.
  
  What You Will Do:
  
  - Own AI intake and delivery across Sales and CSG: run intake,
    clarify business problems, define requirements and success
    metrics, prioritize the backlog, and drive initiatives
    from 0 to 1 through release and iteration.
  - Build and ship AI workflows end-to-end: map current-state
    processes, identify friction, design future-state
    workflows, and implement agents and automations that teams
    can rely on day to day.
  - Partner cross-functionally to unblock delivery: work day-to-
    day with Sales, Customer Success, Marketing Ops, Business
    Technology, Data Science, Finance, and Legal to align on
    requirements, data usage, governance, and measurable
    outcomes.
  - Build with guardrails: embed permissioning, auditability,
    and compliance requirements into workflows from day one.
  - Launch what you build: drive rollout with lightweight
    enablement (training assets, office hours, comms), gather
    feedback, and continuously improve workflows after
    release.
  - Own quality and operational rigor: create test plans, run
    QA, manage prompt and workflow versioning, and maintain
    documentation, runbooks, and release notes so delivery is
    safe and repeatable.
  - Measure impact and iterate: track adoption and performance,
    validate results in partnership with Ops and Analytics,
    and continuously improve workflows based on usage and
    outcomes.
  
  What You Will Bring:
  
  - 3 to 7+ years in Revenue Operations, GTM Systems, Sales Ops,
    CS Ops, Business Systems, or similar roles improving GTM
    execution through process, systems, and automation.
  - A pattern of taking ambiguous GTM problems, getting to the
    root cause fast, and shipping improvements that teams
    actually adopt.
  - Strong judgment and follow-through: you surface tradeoffs
    early, close open loops, and keep work moving from idea to
    rollout to iteration.
  - Comfort with the technical basics that power modern GTM
    automation, including APIs/webhooks, JSON payloads, and
    SQL for validation or analysis (BigQuery preferred).
  - Salesforce fluency and comfort working across pipeline,
    lifecycle, and post-sales workflows.
  
  What Gives You an Edge:
  
  - Hands-on experience with Relevance AI, Momentum, Clay,
    Gemini, or Claude.
  - Familiarity with GTM Systems like Salesloft, Zoominfo,
    Clari, D&B, DemandTools and common Sales and CSG
    workflows.
  - Experience building AI workflows with governance patterns
    (access controls, auditability, feedback loops).
