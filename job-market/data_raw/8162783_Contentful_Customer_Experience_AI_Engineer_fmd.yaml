  About the Opportunity
  
  Contentful is seeking a CX AI Strategist to join the
  Customer Experience team to lead the identification,
  adoption and integration of AI solutions that materially
  improve how our teams work. This is a hands-on builder role
  for a process-oriented, strategic doer who turns AI
  potential into practical, high-impact outcomes by automating
  manual workflows, unlocking new capabilities, and embedding
  AI into day-to-day CX operations.
  
  The ideal candidate brings a strong passion for the applied
  use of modern AI technologies, including large language
  models and agent-based frameworks, combined with CX domain
  knowledge, business acumen, and technical fluency. This role
  goes beyond experimentation. You will identify high return
  use cases, prototype and iterate rapidly with internal
  stakeholders, and integrate AI tools directly into frontline
  workflows in a secure, scalable, and sustainable way.
  
  As a cross-functional operator, you will work closely with
  the Technical Support Leader and wider CX leaders to drive
  clarity and accelerate responsible AI adoption. You will not
  only build solutions, but also enable teams by training them
  on practical tools, fostering confidence in how AI is used
  and ensuring innovation is rooted in real business value.
  Your work will bridge the gap between AI strategy and
  execution, delivering measurable productivity gains while
  aligning with Contentful’s standards and long-term goals.
  
  What to expect?
  
  - Identify and prioritise high-impact AI-driven opportunities
    with Technical Support and across Customer Experience by
    analysing existing workflows, tools, and pain points with
    an AI-first mindset. Translate operational challenges into
    scalable, value-led solutions that improve efficiency and
    effectiveness across CX.
  - Design, build, and implement AI-powered tools and workflows
    that automate repetitive tasks, improve accuracy, and
    expand team capacity, ensuring all solutions deliver
    measurable and demonstrable business outcomes.
  - Independently develop and deploy workflow automations and
    lightweight integrations using APIs, scripting, or low-
    code tooling, taking ideas from concept through to
    production-ready solutions.
  - Leverage low-code and no-code platforms to design, pilot,
    and validate innovative AI-enabled tools and processes.
    Rapidly prototype and test new use cases in close
    partnership with internal stakeholders, iterating based on
    feedback, adoption, and tangible impact.
  - Act as a catalyst for experimentation within Customer
    Experience, fostering a culture of responsible innovation.
    Serve as an AI mentor and coach to raise AI literacy,
    confidence, and day-to-day adoption of AI tools across CX
    teams.
  - Partner closely with Governance and Security teams to ensure
    all AI solutions align with acceptable use policies, legal
    requirements and security standards.
  - Collaborate with teams across the organisation to share best
    practices, playbooks and frameworks, enabling successful
    AI initiatives to scale beyond Customer Experience.
    Identify and deliver opportunities for cross-functional AI
    solutions where they create shared value.
  - Remain actively engaged with internal and external AI
    communities, staying informed on emerging technologies,
    trends and practices, and assessing their relevance and
    potential application within Contentful.
  
  What you need to be successful
  
  - At least five years of experience in operations, internal
    consulting, enablement or strategic process improvement
    roles, ideally within Customer Experience or a closely
    related operational environment.
  - Strong familiarity with SaaS platforms and tooling, with the
    ability to integrate APIs or design and build custom
    workflows.
  - Demonstrated experience launching AI-powered tools or
    solutions that deliver clear and measurable business
    value.
  - A solid understanding of core AI concepts, including prompt
    design, model limitations, data privacy considerations,
    and the underlying structure of AI-enabled systems.
  - Hands-on technical capability to build, deploy, and maintain
    workflow automations or working prototypes using
    scripting, connectors, or automation frameworks, rather
    than operating solely at a conceptual or advisory level.
  - Proven ability to align technology initiatives with business
    needs and to lead cross-functional initiatives from idea
    through to delivery.
  - Strong collaboration skills, with the ability to influence
    and drive outcomes without formal authority in a team-
    focused and solutions-oriented manner.
  - Demonstrated experience designing, launching, and measuring
    process-driven experimentation, using data and feedback to
    iterate and improve outcomes.
