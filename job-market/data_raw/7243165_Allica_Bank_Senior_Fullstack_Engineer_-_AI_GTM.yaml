  About Allica Bank
  
  Allica is the UK’s fastest growing company - and the
  fastest-growing financial technology (Fintech) firm ever.
  Our purpose is to help established SMEs, one of the last
  major underserved opportunities in Fintech.
  
  Established SMEs are the backbone of local communities -
  representing over a third of our economy - yet have been
  largely neglected both by traditional high street banks and
  modern fintech providers.
  
  Department Description
  
  Growth is a critical function at Allica, sitting at the
  intersection of marketing, product, sales, and data. Our
  team is responsible for driving sustainable and scalable
  customer acquisition, engagement, and retention—ensuring our
  banking solutions reach and resonate with the right SMEs at
  the right time. Growth is both a science and an art. We
  blend commercial strategy with deep customer understanding,
  leveraging data to uncover new opportunities while ensuring
  every touchpoint aligns with Allica’s mission to empower
  established SMEs with the banking they deserve.
  
  Role Description
  
  The Senior Fullstack Engineer will be a founding member of
  our AI capability within the Growth Squad, responsible for
  applying advanced large language models (LLMs) to solve
  complex customer and operational challenges. This role will
  create significant value for Allica by building agentic AI
  systems that either eliminate manual effort or transform the
  customer experience — through intelligent automation,
  smarter interfaces, and proactive service.
  
  Working closely with growth, data, product, and operations
  teams, this role will scope, design, and deploy real-world
  AI use cases across marketing, onboarding, and customer
  lifecycle journeys (including initiatives in advertising
  platforms and our CRM, HubSpot). You will bring deep
  expertise in LLMs, prompt engineering, agent frameworks, and
  systems thinking to build scalable, explainable, and
  impactful solutions.
  
  This is a high-impact technical role with clear business
  outcomes. You’ll own the end-to-end delivery of AI solutions
  — from idea to production deployment and monitoring — and
  play a pivotal role in shaping how we scale Allica using AI.
  You will continuously fine-tune and optimize models for
  performance, manage their versioning, and establish robust
  evaluation and monitoring processes to ensure each solution
  remains reliable, efficient, and safe in production.
  
  
  
  Principal Accountabilities
  
  - LLM Application Development: Design and build agentic LLM
    systems that automate manual processes or transform
    customer interactions across key stages of the growth
    funnel.
  - AI Solution Delivery: Lead the end-to-end development of AI
    tools and agents using frameworks like LangChain or
    Semantic Kernel, ensuring scalable and maintainable
    deployment, including fine-tuning models and optimizing
    performance to meet latency and cost constraints
  - Model Deployment & Monitoring: Ensure robust deployment of
    AI models to production, including proper versioning and
    continuous monitoring, leveraging tools like MLflow,
    FastAPI, and Kubernetes (or other cloud-native services)
    to maintain high reliability and performance
  - Workflow Automation & Experience Design: Identify high-
    impact use cases with operations, product, and lifecycle
    teams, creating AI-driven solutions that improve
    efficiency or elevate customer experience.
  - Experimentation & Iteration: Rapidly prototype AI
    applications, run experiments to test impact, and iterate
    based on usage data and feedback.
  - Cross-Functional Collaboration: Partner with growth,
    marketing, engineering, and data teams to prioritize AI
    initiatives, align on business goals, and integrate
    solutions into operational systems.
  - AI Safety & Explainability: Apply best practices in
    responsible AI deployment, ensuring explainability,
    compliance, and ethical use of LLMs in production
    environments.
  - Evaluation & Optimization: Design and implement rigorous
    evaluation frameworks (including custom pipelines) to test
    model performance, quality, and safety. Compare vendor-
    provided models vs. open-source alternatives for overall
    quality, bias, and compliance, ensuring we deploy the
    optimal solutions
  - Innovation & Strategic Impact: Drive innovation through
    continuous learning and experimentation, ensuring AI
    solutions align with Allica’s long-term growth strategy
    and customer-centric values.
  
  Personal Attributes & Experience
  
  Personal Attributes:
  
  - Deeply curious, proactive, and impact-driven with a strong
    bias for action and experimentation.
  - Comfortable operating in ambiguous, fast-paced environments
    where the problem is as novel as the solution.
  - Collaborative and communicative, able to translate technical
    ideas into business language and influence stakeholders.
  - Passionate about the potential of AI to change how
    businesses work and how customers interact with products.
  
  Experience & Technical Skills:
  
  - 3+ years’ professional software engineering experience in
    one or more programming languages (preferably Python and
    Kotlin).
  
  - Proven experience building and deploying LLM-powered tools
    or agents (e.g., using OpenAI, Claude, or open-source
    models).
  
  - Hands-on expertise in Python, LLM frameworks (LangChain,
    Semantic Kernel, etc.), prompt engineering, and
    orchestration.
  
  - Knowledge of model deployment, versioning, and monitoring in
    production (e.g., using MLflow, FastAPI, Kubernetes, or
    similar cloud-native tools)
  
  - Experience integrating AI solutions into real-world systems
    (e.g., CRM platforms like HubSpot, advertising platforms,
    ticketing systems, or internal tools).
  
  - Experience fine-tuning and optimizing LLMs, including
    building efficient embeddings or vector memory stores,
    while managing latency and cost constraints
  
  - Understanding of privacy, bias, and safety considerations
    when applying LLMs in production.
  
  - Strong understanding of vector databases, RAG (retrieval
    augmented generation), and agent workflows.
  
  - Understanding of privacy, bias, and safety considerations
    when applying LLMs in production.
  
  - Experience evaluating AI models for quality and fairness,
    including comparing vendor models vs. open-source
    alternatives and building custom evaluation pipelines to
    validate model performance.
  
  - Comfortable with full-stack development (e.g., building web
    interfaces or APIs) to integrate AI solutions end-to-end.
  
  - Exposure to business domains like growth, marketing
    automation, or customer service is a plus.
  
  This is a unique opportunity to shape how AI drives growth
  at Allica—designing powerful, intelligent systems that scale
  what our teams can do and reimagine how customers experience
  business banking.
