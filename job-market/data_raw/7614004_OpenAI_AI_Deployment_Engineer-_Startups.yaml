  to established global enterprises.
  
  About the Role
  
  We are seeking a technically proficient, business-minded AI
  Deployment Engineer to help push the frontier of advanced AI
  with our strategic startup customers. You'll work with some
  of the most exciting AI startups in the world, guiding them
  through ideation, development, delivery, and scaling to
  accelerate and maximize the value of what they build on our
  platform. You will have the opportunity to work on the most
  novel and creative use cases being built on our API, serving
  as a critical partner in collecting and delivering high-
  fidelity product and model feedback internally. You will
  collaborate closely with Sales, Solutions Engineering,
  Applied Research, and Product teams, and you will report to
  the Startups Solutions Architecture Lead.
  
  This role is based in our NYC HQ. We use a hybrid work model
  of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation
  assistance to new employees.
  
  In this role, you will:
  
  - Partner closely with strategic startup customers as their
    technical thought partner to build novel applications on
    our API, helping them rapidly move from ideation to scale.
  - Provide proactive guidance to maximize business impact and
    accelerate application development.
  - Experiment and prototype alongside customers, demonstrating
    practical use cases.
  - Contribute to open-source resources and scale the function
    by sharing knowledge, codifying best practices, and
    publishing useful resources.
  - Synthesize and deliver valuable feedback to the Product and
    Research teams.
  - Build relationships within the startup ecosystem, serving as
    a technical partner to both individual customers and the
    broader community.
  
  You’ll thrive in this role if you:
  
  - Have 5+ years of experience as a software engineer, ML
    engineer or equivalent, ideally in a startup environment;
    experience as a founder or founding engineer is highly
    valued.
  - Have passion for startups and a belief in their potential to
    become future large enterprises.
  - Are proficient in Python, JavaScript, and a strong grasp of
    AI/LLM best practices.
  - Built and/or delivered prototypes on top of our API
    platform.
  - Can proactively identify opportunities for maximizing our
    customers’ business value through leveraging the OpenAI
    API.
  - Own problems end-to-end and are willing to pick up whatever
    knowledge you're missing to get the job done.
  - Have a humble attitude, an eagerness to help your
    colleagues, and a desire to do whatever it takes to make
    the team succeed.
  - Are an effective, high throughput operator who can drive
    multiple concurrent projects and prioritize ruthlessly.
