  The Mission: Build the OS for Access to Justice
  
  Every year, 400,000 Americans are injured in accidents and
  struggle to access legal representation because the system
  is broken. We believe this is not a legal problem—it's an
  engineering problem. SimpleCITI is seeking a Lead AI
  Architect for one of its portfolio companies to build the
  operating system for the modern law firm: a fully autonomous
  personal injury pre-litigation back office that runs on a
  sophisticated multi-agent system.
  
  This is a pure systems architecture and engineering
  challenge. We are looking for a world-class builder who
  understands that the future of AI is in the sophisticated
  software architecture that harnesses the power of existing
  models. If you are an expert in building reliable, high-
  impact AI systems, this is your opportunity to build
  something that matters.
  
  The Core Challenge: Architecting the Agentic Harness
  
  This is not a research or model-tuning role. Your mission is
  to architect and build the "agentic harness"—the production-
  grade software system that orchestrates foundational models
  to perform complex, real-world work. This requires deep
  expertise in three key areas of systems design:
  
  1. Deep Architecture (Orchestration & Tooling): You will
  design the core framework that allows multiple specialized
  agents to coordinate on long-running tasks. This includes
  building a robust library of tools (APIs), managing state
  across a distributed system, and implementing sophisticated
  error recovery.
  
  2. Advanced Memory Systems (High-Fidelity RAG): You will
  architect a high-fidelity memory system that gives agents
  the precise context they need to reason over thousands of
  pages of unstructured, domain-specific documents. This goes
  beyond simple RAG to include complex data ingestion,
  chunking, and retrieval strategies.
  
  3. Reliability & Validation Frameworks (Reasoning Loops):
  You will build the systems that ensure 99.9%+ accuracy. This
  involves implementing multi-agent validation loops (e.g., a
  "reviewer" agent that critiques a "drafter" agent),
  confidence scoring, and human-in-the-loop escalation paths
  for high-stakes decisions.
  
  Example Agent Architectures You Will Build
  
  You will apply your expertise in agentic harnessing to build
  a suite of specialized AI agents. Examples include:
  
  Medical Record Intelligence Agent: This is more than just
  OCR. You will architect a multi-step agent that ingests
  thousands of pages of unstructured medical records (faxes,
  handwritten notes, EMR exports), builds a structured
  timeline, and performs causation analysis to distinguish
  pre-existing conditions from accident-related injuries. This
  requires a high-fidelity RAG system with medical domain-
  specific chunking and a validation loop where a secondary
  agent reviews the primary agent's findings for accuracy
  before finalizing the output.
  
  Demand Package Generation Agent: This is not a simple text
  generator. You will build a multi-agent system where a
  "researcher" agent gathers relevant case law and medical
  data, a "drafter" agent writes a persuasive legal argument,
  and a "validator" agent checks citations and ensures the
  argument aligns with jurisdiction-specific rules. This
  requires sophisticated agent coordination and tool
  integration with legal research APIs.
  
  RequirementsTechnical Requirements
  
  - Demonstrable experience architecting and deploying
    production-grade, multi-agent AI systems (3+ specialized,
    coordinating agents) serving real, external users.
  - Deep, hands-on expertise with agentic AI frameworks (e.g.,
    LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI) and the architectural
    patterns that make them reliable at scale.
  - Expert-level Python and a strong background in designing
    complex, distributed systems (e.g., microservices, APIs,
    data orchestration).
  - Experience building AI systems in regulated industries
    (healthcare, legal, finance) with HIPAA or SOC 2
    compliance.
