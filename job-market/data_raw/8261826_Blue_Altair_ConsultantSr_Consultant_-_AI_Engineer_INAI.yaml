    quantitative discipline, e.g., Computer Science,
    Mathematics, Statistics, Artificial Intelligence.
  - Hands-on experience with statistical software tools. We
    prefer experience in Python and Python statistical
    libraries. Experience in R is also accepted, as is SAS,
    SPSS, Strata, and MATLAB.
  - Deep conceptual understanding of probability & statistics,
    ML algorithm intuition, and computer science fundamentals.
  - Deep experience in statistical and machine learning
    techniques such as classification, regression, feature
    selection and feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning,
    unsupervised learning methods, time series analysis,
    forecasting etc.
  - Deep understanding of GenAI Models training and fine tuning
    of them.
  - Proven experience in Generative AI (GenAI) including model

  - Experience implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
    pipelines using Vector Databases (e.g., Pinecone,
    Weaviate, Milvus, FAISS).
  - Strong knowledge of Embeddings (text, image, multimodal) and
    their application in semantic search, personalization, and
    recommendation systems.
  - Familiarity with Agentic AI frameworks (LangChain,
