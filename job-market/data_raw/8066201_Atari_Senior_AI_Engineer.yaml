  About the Role
  
  We're seeking a Senior AI Engineer to lead cutting-edge
  AI/ML solutions across multiple initiatives. You'll combine
  hands-on development with strategic thinking, working on
  projects from intelligent automation to predictive analytics
  while shaping our AI strategy.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Design, develop, and deploy production AI/ML models for
    intelligent automation, predictive systems, pattern
    recognition, and decision support
  - Research and experiment with state-of-the-art AI techniques
    (deep learning, NLP, computer vision, RL) to identify new
    opportunities
  - Build and optimize ML infrastructure including training
    pipelines, model serving, data preprocessing, and
    monitoring frameworks
  - Develop transformation systems that process structured data,
    understand patterns, and enable intelligent cross-platform
    automation
  - Integrate LLMs using LangChain, LlamaIndex, and similar
    frameworks to create conversational systems, document
    processing, and automated workflows
  - Design agentic AI systems that autonomously interact with
    tools, APIs, and services to accomplish multi-step tasks
  - Build integrations between AI systems and third-party
    applications via RESTful APIs, webhooks, and event-driven
    architectures
  - Collaborate with product, engineering, and data science
    teams to identify AI opportunities and integrate
    capabilities
  - Establish ML best practices including versioning, A/B
    testing, monitoring, and continuous improvement processes
  - Stay current with AI research, evaluate emerging
    technologies, and recommend strategic investments
  - Mentor junior engineers, conduct code reviews, and build
    strong AI engineering culture
  
  Requirements
  
  - 5+ in AI/ML engineering with proven track record deploying
    production AI systems, especially LLM-based applications
    and intelligent automation
  - Deep expertise in LangChain, LlamaIndex, or similar LLM
    frameworks, with strong understanding of prompt
    engineering, RAG, and AI orchestration
  - Strong software engineering skills in Python,
    JavaScript/TypeScript, RESTful APIs, microservices, and
    cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP)
  - Production experience with LLMs including prompt
    engineering, fine-tuning, RAG implementation, and managing
    API limits/costs
  - Experience building agentic AI systems and orchestrating
    workflows that integrate multiple AI models and external
    services
  - Excellent problem-solving, communication skills, and ability
    to work in cross-functional teams
  
  Bonus Points
  
  - Experience with major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic,
    Google, Azure OpenAI) and vector databases (Pinecone,
    Weaviate, ChromaDB) for RAG
  - Open-source contributions to LLM frameworks, autonomous
    agents, or AI orchestration tools
  - Production-scale conversational AI, chatbots, or assistants
    with error handling and context management
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Master's or Bachelor’s in Computer Science, AI, or related
    field with focus on ML, NLP, or software engineering
  - Experience with ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-
    learn) for custom model development and fine-tuning
  
  Working Hours: Standard business hours with flexibility for
  global team collaboration. Some overlap with North American
  hours may be required for critical phases.
