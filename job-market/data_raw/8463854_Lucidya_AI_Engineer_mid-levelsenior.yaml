  machine learning, deep learning, and production AI, turning
  advanced models into reliable, scalable systems used by
  enterprise customers.
  
  This role goes beyond experimentation - you will help take
  AI from concept to production, ensuring performance, ethical
  compliance, and real-world impact.
  
  You will have the opportunity to showcase your ability to
  build from 0 to a real solution that drives value
  
  What You’ll Do

  - Design, develop, and optimize AI Agents
  - Build evaluation for AI Agent performance, ensuring that AI
    Agents are working as expected
  - Research and optimise the way we do things
  - Contribute to the development of the Lucidya AI Agent
    platform
  
  Production & Scalability
  
  - Deploy AI models into production environments with a focus
    on scalability, performance, and reliability.
  - Collaborate on MLOps practices to support continuous
    integration, monitoring, and improvement.
  - Ensure AI systems integrate smoothly with existing platforms
    and workflows.
  
  Cross-Functional Collaboration
  
  - Work closely with software engineers, product managers, and
    domain experts
  - Translate business problems into effective AI solutions with
    measurable outcomes.
  - Contribute to solution design for enterprise solutions and
    long-term deployments.
  
  Governance & Quality
  
  - Ensure AI solutions comply with ethical standards, data

  Technical Skills
  
  - 3+ years of hands-on experience building and deploying AI-

  - Strong programming skills in Python (Java is a plus).
  - Hands-on experience with machine learning and deep learning
    techniques.
  - Practical experience using TensorFlow, OpenAISDK or similar

    AI-driven solutions.
  - Strong systems thinking, understanding how models behave in
    real-world environments.
  - Curiosity and commitment to continuous learning in a fast-
    evolving AI landscape.
  - Proactivity is key - not just a task doer

  - Comfortable working in cross-functional, product-driven
    teams.
  - Able to clearly document and explain technical concepts to
    diverse stakeholders.
  
  Nice to Have

    experiments.
  - Shape a new business unit from the ground up.
  - Solve meaningful CX and operational challenges across the
    MENA region.
  - Collaborate with a highly skilled AI, data, and product
    team.
