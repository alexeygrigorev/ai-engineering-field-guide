description: |
  About the Role
  
  We are building agentic workflows that operate directly
  inside our GTM and revenue stack. As a Principal AI /
  Automation Engineer, you will own the architecture, data and
  intelligence layer, and execution quality of autonomous and
  semi-autonomous agents that power GTM use cases such as
  event-based personalized communications, churn prevention,
  expansion, deal acceleration, and GTM intelligence.
  
  This role sits at the intersection of LLM-powered agents,
  Model Context Protocols (MCPs), Data warehouse, CRM systems,
  and GTM stack.
  
  You will work as an execution partner to the Global Head of
  GTM Systems, translating GTM goals into scalable,
  production-grade agentic systems with measurable revenue
  impact.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  Agentic Systems Architecture
  
  - Design event-driven, multi-step agent workflows with
    reasoning, memory, and tools.
  - Define standards for autonomy, guardrails, and human-in-the-
    loop escalation.
  - Build reusable agent frameworks across churn, expansion,
    pipeline, and ops etc.
  
  Data Architecture & Pipeline Engineering
  
  - Design, build, and maintain scalable ELT/ETL pipelines that
    centralize data from disparate GTM sources into our data
    warehouse.
  - Own the "Reverse ETL" process to push actionable insights
    from the warehouse back into frontline tools (e.g.,
    pushing lead scores into Salesforce or churn alerts into
    Slack).
  
  Model Context Protocols (MCPs) and Data warehouse
  integration
  
  - Design and implement reusable MCPs that govern how agents
    request data, receive structured context, write back
    actions and outcomes for account & lifecycle context,
    product usage and adoption, pipeline, deal, and forecast
    context and customer health and revenue risk etc.
  - Build secure connectors to data warehouses (Snowflake,
    BigQuery, Redshift, etc.), CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot),
    Product, billing, and support systems etc.
  - Design agent-optimized query patterns.
  - Ensure data freshness, correctness, and permission-aware
    access.
  
  LLM & Intelligence Layer
  
  - Implement prompt strategies, tool calling, and RAG
    pipelines.
  - Optimize agents for accuracy, latency, and cost.
  - Build feedback loops to continuously improve agent
    decisions.
  
  Reliability, Governance & Trust
  
  - Implement observability across MCP calls, data access, and
    agent decisions.
  - Enforce role-based access control, PII handling, and
    auditability.
  - Reduce hallucinations and ensure consistent revenue
    definitions.
  
  Preferred Experience and Qualifications:
  
  - Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering,
    Data Science, Mathematics, or a related STEM field.
  - A course providing deeper knowledge in AI/ML is preferred.
  - 5+ years of data/AI engineering experience.
  - Proven ownership of large-scale automation or AI systems.
  - Hands-on with LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic etc) and experience
    shipping LLM-powered applications or agents.
  - Strong in Python and/or TypeScript.
  - Experience with agent frameworks (LangGraph, AutoGen,
    CrewAI, etc.).
  - Deep experience with SQL, data modeling, and warehouses.
  - Familiar with event-driven architectures and workflow
    orchestration.
  - Comfortable operating with high ambiguity and high
    ownership.
