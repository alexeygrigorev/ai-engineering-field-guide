  About Onebrief
  
  Onebrief is collaboration and AI-powered workflow software
  designed specifically for military staffs. By transforming
  this work, Onebrief makes the staff as a whole superhuman -
  meaning faster, smarter, and more efficient.
  
  We take ownership, seek excellence, and play to win with the
  seriousness and camaraderie of an Olympic team. Onebrief
  operates as an all-remote company, though many of our
  employees work alongside our customers at military commands
  around the world.
  
  Founded in 2019 by a group of experienced planners, today,
  Onebrief’s team spans veterans from all forces and global
  organizations, and technologists from leading-edge software
  companies. We’ve raised $320m+ from top-tier investors,
  including Battery Ventures, General Catalyst, Sapphire
  Ventures, Insight Partners, and Human Capital, and today,
  Onebrief is valued at $2.15B. With this continued growth,
  Onebrief is able to make an impact where it matters most.
  
  About the Role
  
  We're hiring a Principal AI/ML Engineer to lead the design
  and implementation of enterprise-grade AI systems that power
  mission-critical operations. In this role, you will
  architect scalable AI infrastructure, deliver practical AI
  solutions that solve real operational challenges, and drive
  technical strategy for our AI-powered products.
  
  You'll apply cutting edge AI to transform complex military
  requirements for planning critical operations into robust
  production-ready systems. You will have the opportunity to
  redefine distributed human-AI collaboration at scale with
  the use of multi modal foundation models, multi-agent
  orchestration and knowledge graph driven reasoning.
  
  Expect to lead cross-functional technical initiatives,
  mentor engineers, and establish technical standards that
  enable rapid innovation while ensuring reliability. The
  solutions you design must be robust, scalable, and able to
  support thousands of users in regulated, offline-capable
  environments.
  
  What You'll Do
  
  - Partner with product, domain experts, and leadership to
    translate operational needs into technical roadmaps.
  - Define system-level standards for model development,
    evaluation, and deployment, while mentoring senior and
    staff level engineers through collaboration.
  - Drive long term AI/ML architecture at Onebrief.
  - Agent Orchestration: Design systems that coordinate multiple
    AI agents, tools, and workflows to accomplish complex
    operational tasks.
  - Design and implement enterprise-scale AI infrastructure
    supporting retrieval, generation, and multi-modal
    reasoning.
  - Build and scale graph-based systems for structured
    representation, reasoning, and integration with generative
    models.
  - Apply LLM practices like RAG & prompt engineering to deliver
    grounded & reliable outputs for mission planning
  - Establish evaluation frameworks and SLO's for RAG quality,
    agent reliability, and system performance in production
  - Collaborate with infrastructure teams to ensure high quality
    data pipelines to power AI applications
  
  What We Look For
  
  - M.S. in Computer Science, Engineering, or equivalent
    practical experience
  - 10+ years in large scale distributed systems, ideally
    supporting more than 100k concurrent users
  - Proven experience designing and deploying AI systems at
    scale in distributed, production environments
  - Strong background in integrating LLMs with retrieval systems
    for real-world use cases
  - Understanding of data governance, model safety evaluations,
    red-teaming, and secure ML practices for regulated domains
  - Experience with building systems with information retrieval
    (relevance & ranking), natural language processing
    techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Background in defense, national security, or other mission-
    critical domains
  - Experience with orchestrating systems that combine text,
    structured data, and domain-specific signals
