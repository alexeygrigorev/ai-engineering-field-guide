description: |
  Legal teams are drowning in repetitive work. The rest of the
  business is stuck waiting. Flank is changing that.
  
  We are operating at the cutting edge of AI development,
  building the future of autonomous agents for the enterprise.
  We have raised a $10M Series A led by Insight Partners (US),
  with continued support from Gradient Ventures (Google’s AI
  fund), HV Capital, and Speedinvest (EU).
  
  This isn't a "nice-to-have" tool for small startups. We are
  already deploying Flank agents to multinational enterprises
  with 100,000+ employees, completely automating workflows
  that were previously impossible to solve. Our agents work
  24/7, operating under supervision and within guardrails
  customers define, and routing only exceptions to legal for
  review. Every request and action is transparent & auditable,
  ensuring customers have full visibility over their automated
  workforce.
  
  We’re seeking an experienced AI Engineer to drive our
  applied AI initiatives.
  
  We’re a fast-moving start-up where you’ll work closely with
  product, design, and commercial teams to ship real AI into
  production — not just research experiments.
  
  You will be tasked with leveraging emerging technologies and
  a team of legal experts to improve the intelligence and
  autonomy of our agents.
  
  This might start with building an evals framework in
  collaboration with our team of lawyers, it might spawn a
  hypervisor that governs every step of our agentic system and
  that “knows what good looks like”, and it might end with us
  building the first alignment program for legal AI systems.
  
  What you’ll be doing:
  
  - Drive Applied Research: Drive applied research into LLMs and
    agentic systems, rapidly prototyping, validating, and
    shipping production-ready capabilities.
  - Stay Ahead of the Curve: Stay hands-on with the latest
    advances in foundation models, LLM-as-a-judge, agentic
    frameworks & tools (e.g. MCP), and move fast to bring them
    into the product.
  
  Who you are:
  
  - Demonstrated Experience: A strong track record of leading
    and delivering cutting-edge AI initiatives that have
    driven meaningful product and business impact. Hands-on
    experience building and deploying ML/AI products is
    essential.
  - Technical Expertise:
    - Strong programming skills in Python (and familiarity with
      TypeScript/Go a plus).
    - Experience with deep learning frameworks (PyTorch,
      TensorFlow, Hugging Face).
    - Hands-on experience deploying ML/LLM models in production
      environments.
    - Solid understanding of data pipelines, APIs, and distributed
      systems.
    - Knowledge of prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning, and
      embeddings for LLMs.
    - Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and
      containerization (Docker, Kubernetes
  - Thought Leadership: Ph.D. or Master’s in Computer Science,
    Machine Learning, or a related field from a leading
    academic institution.
  - Cross-Functional Collaboration: Proven ability to build
    strong partnerships across product, engineering, and
    research teams to drive innovation.
  
  What’s In It for You
  
  - Innovative Work: Be part of a team making bold bets to
    create a new paradigm in AI-enhanced legal services.
  - High Standards Culture: Join a team that demands excellence
    and accountability through direct and candid
    communication.
  - Empowered Environment: Operate in a high-agency culture
    where you can lead yourself and make a real impact.
  - Global Team: Remote-first, collaborate with a diverse,
    talented team across the globe.
  - Competitive, Benchmarked Salary
industries:
  - Artificial Intelligence
  - Legal Tech
  - Software
  - Generative AI
