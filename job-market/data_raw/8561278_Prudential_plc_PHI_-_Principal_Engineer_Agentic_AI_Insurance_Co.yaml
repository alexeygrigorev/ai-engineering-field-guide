  Job Title: Principal Engineer – Agentic AI Insurance Core
  
  Location: India (Remote / Location-Agnostic) Travel: ~1 week
  per month to Mumbai HQ Reporting to: CTIO or Enterprise
  Architect
  
  1. Mission: Achieve Total Technology Sovereignty
  
  Lead the engineering of a fully proprietary, Agentic AI-
  powered insurance core that eliminates dependency on
  third‑party SaaS systems. You will drive a multi-phase
  “SaaS‑replacement roadmap” built on Vertex AI, Gemini 1.5
  Pro, BigQuery ML, GKE, and Apigee.
  
  Phase 1 — AI Product & Pricing Engine (Current Priority)
  
  - Build the Agentic Product Engine to configure complex health
    insurance products and dynamic pricing logic.
  - Replace rigid SaaS rating engines by architecting an Agentic
    Quotation System capable of multi-variant, real‑time
    quoting.
  
  Phase 2 — Agentic Sales & Proposal Stack
  
  - Develop the Agentic Proposal System for automated data
    capture, form understanding, and intent
    recognition—replacing traditional CRM modules.
  - Engineer the Agentic Underwriting Engine using LLMs and
    Document AI to automate medical and financial scrutiny,
    replacing SaaS underwriting workbenches.
  
  Phase 3 — Financial Core (Policy, Accounting, Compliance)
  
  - Build the Agentic Policy Issuance & Premium Accounting Core
    for real-time ledgering, GST compliance, receivables, and
    policy document generation.
  - Deliver native integrations with:
    - National Health Claims Exchange (NHCX)
    - Bima Sugam—without relying on middleware vendors.
  
  2. Technical Requirements (GCP‑First, AI‑Native)
  
  Agentic Orchestration (Core Skill)
  
  - Expert-level capability in Vertex AI Agent Builder,
    LangGraph, or CrewAI.
  - Ability to design multi-agent pipelines across pricing →
    underwriting → issuance with safe, deterministic
    execution.
  
  Generative AI Expertise
  
  - Mastery of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines.
  - Experience fine-tuning Gemini models for:
    - Clinical document parsing
    - Regulatory adherence (IRDAI)
    - Complex reasoning in medical & financial decisioning
  
  “SaaS‑Killer Stack” (Backend + Platform)
  
  - Deep experience with:
    - GKE (high-scale microservices)
    - BigQuery ML (risk scoring, FWA models)
    - Apigee for hospital network APIs via HL7 FHIR
  - Ability to design systems where AI agents safely trigger
    financial operations (SPDI-sensitive).
  
  Infrastructure & Data Standards
  
  - Experience with secure architectures handling PHI/SPDI.
  - Comfort building for high auditability and traceability.
  
  3. Domain & Regulatory Expertise
  
  - Understanding of the Indian Health Insurance ecosystem and
    ABDM protocols.
  - Familiarity with medical coding frameworks: ICD‑10 / ICD‑11.
  - Experience migrating off SaaS platforms such as Salesforce,
    Duck Creek, Guidewire, or equivalent.
  
  4. Why This Role?
  
  Full IP Ownership
  
  Every system you build directly replaces a SaaS
  license—increasing valuation, autonomy, and long-term
  defensibility.
  
  Cloud-Agnostic Talent, GCP-Native Execution
  
  Flexible work location, but leveraging the full capabilities
  of Google Cloud’s AI-first ecosystem.
  
  Strategic, High-Impact Engineering
  
  You will design and own the “Nervous System” of the company
  while working closely with the CTIO, architecture, and
  business leadership.
  
  Candidate Profile
  
  The ideal candidate is a Builder who views SaaS as technical
  debt and believes in first‑principles engineering.
  
  You should have:
  
  - 8+ years of high-scale backend engineering experience.
  - 2+ years building or deploying production-grade AI agents.
  - The mindset and discipline to operate in a Day‑1, high-
    intensity, IP‑first environment.
  - A bias toward creating proprietary systems over stitching
    SaaS components.
