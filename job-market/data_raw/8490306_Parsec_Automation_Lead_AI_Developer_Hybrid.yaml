  Parsec Automation, LLC is a global leader in manufacturing
  operations management software. Recognized by Gartner, IDC,
  and numerous industry awards, Parsec’s flagship MES
  platform, TrakSYS™, powers efficiency, quality, and
  compliance improvements at over 11,000 plants across 140+
  countries. Manufacturers such as Johnson & Johnson, Merck,
  Toyota, Procter & Gamble, Hershey, Siemens, and DuPont rely
  on TrakSYS to manage complex operations with clarity and
  precision.
  
  Parsec is backed by BVP Forge, part of the $20B Bessemer
  platform, known for supporting category-defining companies
  such as LinkedIn, Procore, Shopify, and Toast.
  
  About the Role
  
  The Lead AI Developer will architect and implement advanced
  AI capabilities inside our Microsoft-based, customer-network
  (on-prem) platform. A primary focus of this role is building
  production-grade agentic AI functionality, including an MCP-
  based tool ecosystem and secure integrations with hosted LLM
  providers.
  
  This role goes beyond experimentation. You will design AI
  systems that are safe, observable, scalable, and supportable
  in regulated manufacturing environments. You will be hands-
  on in architecture and development while also providing
  technical leadership, mentorship, and design oversight
  across AI-related initiatives within the platform.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  AI Architecture & Implementation (80%)
  
  - Define the reference architecture for AI capabilities within
    an on-prem Microsoft stack (ASP.NET, .NET services, SQL
    Server).
  - Design and implement a production-grade agent runtime
    integrated into web and service layers with clear
    boundaries, policy controls, and auditability.
  - Build agent/orchestrator services to manage:
    - Conversation and task state
    - Tool routing and execution
    - Retries, timeouts, and step limits
  - Integrate with hosted LLM providers (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI,
    others) using function/tool calling patterns and response
    quality guardrails.
  - Establish patterns for MCP servers/clients, tool contracts
    (schemas, semantics), versioning, and backward
    compatibility.
  - Build and maintain locally hosted MCP tool servers to
    securely access:
    - SQL Server (stored procedures, parameterized queries, row
      limiting)
    - Internal REST APIs and service endpoints
    - File/report generation subsystems
  - Implement safety boundaries (read-only vs. gated write
    tools), validation layers, and consistent error handling.
  - Design and implement human-in-the-loop workflows for
    sensitive actions, including confirmations, approvals, and
    UI transparency.
  - Ensure secure-by-design principles including:
    - Least privilege access
    - Data minimization
    - Secrets management
    - Environment configuration standards
    - Audit logging of tool calls and outputs
  - Build comprehensive observability (structured logging,
    tracing, metrics, dashboards).
  - Develop and maintain a strong testing strategy (unit,
    integration, contract testing, simulated tool failures)
  
  Technical Leadership & Collaboration (20%)
  
  - Provide technical leadership and mentorship across AI
    development initiatives.
  - Lead architecture discussions, conduct design/code reviews,
    and drive implementation to completion.
  - Partner with Product Management to translate prioritized use
    cases into an actionable AI roadmap aligned to platform
    constraints and release cadence.
  - Create developer documentation and “golden path” templates
    for building new agents and tools.
  - Support on-prem deployment design (upgrade paths, rollback
    strategies, diagnostics).
  - Assist implementation and support teams in troubleshooting
    AI-related issues.
  - Continue expanding expertise in relevant technologies, the
    TrakSYS™ platform, and manufacturing domain concepts.
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering,
    Information Technology, or related field.
  - 7+ years of professional software development experience,
    including production distributed systems.
  - Strong .NET experience (C#, ASP.NET, Windows Services and/or
    .NET Worker Services).
  - Microsoft SQL Server experience (schema design, safe query
    patterns, stored procedures/views, performance
    fundamentals).
  - Experience integrating with LLM APIs and implementing
    production-grade tool/function calling patterns.
  - Experience designing API/tool contracts (schemas,
    versioning, error handling, idempotency,
    pagination/limits).
  - Solid understanding of security fundamentals
    (authentication, authorization, least privilege, secrets
    management, threat modeling).
  - Ability to lead architecture discussions and produce clear
    technical designs.
  - Familiarity with Windows client/server environments and on-
    prem deployment considerations.
  
  
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Experience with MCP (Model Context Protocol) or similar
    plugin/tool ecosystems.
  - Experience with Semantic Kernel and/or
    Microsoft.Extensions.AI in .NET applications.
  - Experience deploying enterprise software.
  - Familiarity with manufacturing/MES concepts (ISA-95
    hierarchies, production events, downtime, quality
    workflows).
  - Experience with Azure (identity, networking, OpenAI service
    integration, monitoring).
  - Experience implementing policy and guardrail layers
    (approval flows, content filtering, RAG constraints).

  - Flexible schedule
  - Variable Bonus based on company and individual performance
  - 401(k) with company match
