  - Build scalable APIs, frameworks, and reusable components
    that enable teams to rapidly create and deploy secure AI
    agents.
  - Contribute to monitoring, evaluation, and governance
    features that make AI adoption safe, reliable, and
    enterprise-ready.
  - Partner with Applied AI engineers, product managers, and
    designers to ensure the platform supports real-world use
    cases.
  - Mentor engineers within the India team, raising the bar on
    technical craftsmanship and platform design.
  - Stay current with advances in agentic AI, orchestration
    frameworks, and enterprise AI infrastructure.
  
  What we are looking for:
  
  - 8+ years of software engineering experience, with at least
    3+ years in AI/ML platforms or intelligent automation.
  - 5+ years in Python preferred, Java, Node.js, or Go.
  - 3+ years with modern front-end frameworks (e.g., React, Vue,
    Angular), principles of accessibility (a11y), and an
    ability to collaborate effectively with Product & Design.
  - Expertise in AI agent frameworks (LangGraph preferred),
    orchestration systems, vector databases, RAG pipelines,
    and monitoring/observability.
  - Strong background in distributed systems, APIs,
    microservices, container orchestration (ECS/EKS), and
    cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure).
  - Experience building secure, enterprise-grade infrastructure
    for AI or ML workloads.
  - Ability to influence architecture decisions, align with a
    global team, and set technical direction locally.
  - Strong communication and collaboration skills to work
    effectively across time zones and global teams.
