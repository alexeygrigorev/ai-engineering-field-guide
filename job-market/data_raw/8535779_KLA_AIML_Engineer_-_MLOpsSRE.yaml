  Job Description/Preferred Qualifications
  
  We are seeking a hands-on AI/ML Engineer specializing in
  MLOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) to build,
  operate, and continuously improve production-grade machine
  learning systems. In this role, you will partner with data
  scientists, data engineers, and software teams to
  standardize the ML lifecycle, improve reliability and
  performance, and enable rapid, safe delivery of models and
  AI services at scale.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Production ML Platform & Tooling
  
  - Design and implement reusable MLOps platform capabilities
    for training, deployment, and monitoring of ML/LLM
    systems.
  
  - Build standardized pipelines for data validation, feature
    generation, training, evaluation, model packaging, and
    release.
  
  - Own model registry, artifact storage, and metadata lineage
    to ensure reproducibility and auditability.
  
  - Deployment Engineering & Release Safety
  
  - Deploy models and AI services using containers and
    orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) with robust rollout
    strategies (blue/green, canary, A/B).
  
  - Create CI/CD workflows for ML code and pipelines, including
    automated tests, quality gates, and approval controls.
  
  - Harden inference services for low latency and high
    throughput using caching, batching, autoscaling, and
    efficient model serving patterns.
  
  - Reliability, Observability & Incident Response (SRE)
  
  - Define and track service-level indicators (SLIs) and
    service-level objectives (SLOs) for ML services,
    pipelines, and data dependencies.
  
  - Implement end-to-end observability: structured logging,
    metrics, tracing, dashboards, and alerting for both
    infrastructure and model behavior.
  
  - Lead incident response and post-incident reviews; drive
    systemic fixes through runbooks, automation, and
    reliability engineering practices.
  
  - Model & Data Monitoring
  
  - Implement monitoring for model quality and data health:
    drift, bias, performance degradation, and data pipeline
    anomalies.
  
  - Build automated feedback loops to trigger investigations,
    retraining workflows, and safe rollback when quality
    thresholds are breached.
  
  - Security, Compliance & Governance
  
  - Integrate security best practices: secrets management,
    least-privilege access (RBAC), network controls, and
    vulnerability scanning.
  
  - Support compliance and governance requirements for model
    usage, data access, retention, and responsible AI
    practices.
  
  - Collaboration & Enablement
  
  - Partner with data science and engineering teams to translate
    business requirements into reliable, scalable ML
    solutions.
  
  - Create developer-friendly documentation, templates, and
    internal best practices; mentor teams on MLOps and
    reliability standards.
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  - Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Data
    Science, or a related field with 5+ years of relevant
    experience; OR a Master's/PhD with 3+ years of relevant
    experience.
  
  - Proven experience deploying and operating ML models or AI
    services in production environments.
  
  - Strong programming skills in Python and experience with
    common ML libraries and frameworks (e.g., PyTorch,
    TensorFlow, scikit-learn).
  
  - Hands-on DevOps/SRE experience: CI/CD, infrastructure as
    code, containerization, and operational excellence.
  
  - Experience with cloud platforms and managed services (Azure,
    AWS, or GCP) and building scalable, secure systems.
  
  - Experience with Kubernetes and modern model serving patterns
    (REST/gRPC, async workers, batch/stream inference).
  
  - Strong understanding of monitoring and observability
    (metrics, logs, traces) and incident management processes.
  
  - Ability to communicate clearly with both technical and non-
    technical stakeholders, and to operate effectively in
    cross-functional teams.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Experience with ML platform tools such as MLflow, Kubeflow,
    Airflow, SageMaker, Vertex AI, or Azure Machine Learning.
  
  - Experience with feature stores, data quality frameworks, and
    dataset/versioning tools (e.g., Feast, Great Expectations,
    DVC).
  
  - Experience with distributed systems performance tuning
    (autoscaling, queueing, caching, load shedding).
  
  - Experience implementing model monitoring for drift, bias,
    and quality (e.g., Evidently, whylogs, custom statistical
    checks).
  
  - Knowledge of security and compliance patterns for enterprise
    AI (data classification, encryption, audit logging).
  
  - Contributions to open-source projects, publications, or
    demonstrated technical leadership through talks/blogs.
  
  What Success Looks Like (First 6-12 Months)
  
  - Standardized CI/CD and deployment patterns for ML services
    that reduce time-to-production while improving safety and
    reliability.
  
  - Clear SLOs, dashboards, and alerts for critical AI services
    with measurable improvements in uptime, latency, and
    incident response.
  
  - Automated monitoring and quality checks that detect drift
    and data issues early, with repeatable remediation
    workflows.
  
  - Improved reproducibility and governance through consistent
    artifact tracking, lineage, and documentation.
  
  
  
  Note: Technology choices may vary by team needs; candidates
  should be comfortable learning and adapting to new tools.
  
  Minimum Qualifications
  
  Doctorate (Academic) Degree and 0 years related work
  experience; Master's Level Degree and related work
  experience of 3 years; Bachelor's Level Degree and related
  work experience of 5 years
