  reliability of backend infrastructure and the quality of
  Generative AI features powering our agentic applications.
  This role combines deep technical expertise in automated
  testing & AI/ ML focused quality engineering, enabling you
  to establish quality standards that span from microservices
  architecture to AI/ML models. You'll be instrumental in
  building the testing frameworks and quality processes that
  ensure our products are robust, reliable, and production-
  ready.
  
  What You Will Do
  
  - Design and execute comprehensive test plans for backend
    services, APIs, and microservices architectures.

    Pytest, Playwright, unittest, and integration testing
    libraries.
  - Build end-to-end test suites that validate the integration
    between backend systems, AI agents, databases & services.
  - Advocate for quality-first practices, influencing
    architectural decisions and embedding testing into the
    development lifecycle.
  
  - Design and implement automated evaluation frameworks for
    Generative AI features, including LLM / SLM model testing,
    prompt/ output validation, and behavioral assessment of
    agentic workflows.
  - Develop quality metrics and evaluation methodologies for
    LLM-based applications, assessing accuracy, consistency,
    reliability, quality of AI/ML models.
  - Create and maintain curated evaluation datasets and
    synthetic test data that cover edge cases, adversarial
    scenarios, and real-world variability.
  - Leverage AI evaluation tools and frameworks & establish
    observability and monitoring requirements to quality
    assessment.
  
  - Establish observability and monitoring requirements
    including structured logging, metrics collection, and
    tracing for both backend services and AI agent behavior.
  - Implement quality gates and acceptance criteria and create
    test documentation including test plans, automation
    architecture, quality reports, and runbooks.
  - Build strategies for testing in cloud environments &
    containerized execution.
  - Implement performance testing, load testing, and reliability
    testing for production backend services and AI inference
    pipelines.
  - Define and champion quality standards, best practices, and
