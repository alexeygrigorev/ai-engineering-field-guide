  Our Mission
  
  Healthcare should work for patients, but it doesn’t. In
  their time of need, they call down outdated insurance
  directories. Then wait on hold. Then wait weeks for the
  privilege of a visit. Then wait in a room solely designed
  for waiting. Then wait for a surprise bill. In any other
  consumer industry, the companies delivering such a poor
  customer experience would not survive. But in healthcare,
  patients lack market power. Which means they are expected to
  accept the unacceptable.
  
  Zocdoc’s mission is to give power to the patient. To do
  that, we’ve built the leading healthcare marketplace that
  makes it easy to find and book in-person or virtual care in
  all 50 states, across +200 specialties and +12k insurance
  plans. By giving patients the ability to see and choose, we
  give them power. In doing so, we can make healthcare work
  like every other consumer sector, where businesses compete
  for customers, not the other way around. In time, this will
  drive quality up and prices down.
  
  We’re 18 years old and the leader in our space, but we are
  still just getting started. If you like solving important,
  complex problems alongside deeply thoughtful, driven, and
  collaborative teammates, read on.
  
  Your Impact on Our Mission
  
  Help shape the future of healthcare communication by
  building Zocdoc’s AI Phone Assistant Zo, an intelligent
  voice agent that answers inbound calls for hospitals and
  doctor’s offices. This is a high-impact, high-growth
  initiative where you’ll help design, build, and scale AI
  systems that are redefining how patients and providers
  connect.
  
  This team builds with emerging tools and approaches,
  continuously researching, experimenting, and evaluating how
  AI systems behave in production. Our focus is on designing
  intelligent flows, orchestration, and decision-making — not
  just individual model calls.
  
  Engineers on this team take ideas from early exploration
  through production and continue evolving them based on real
  usage.
  
  Your Day to Day
  
  - Architect, build, and maintain high-quality, scalable
    software systems that power Zocdoc’s AI Phone Assistant.
  - Design and implement AI-driven workflows, integrating large
    language models (LLMs) and conversational AI into
    production systems.
  - Lead prompt engineering, model integration, and system
    optimization to improve accuracy, responsiveness, and
    reliability.
  - Collaborate cross-functionally with product, design, and
    data science teams to deliver production-grade AI
    capabilities.
  - Drive the evolution of our AI platform — from
    experimentation and rapid prototyping to scalable,
    reliable systems in production.
  - Ensure system scalability, observability, and performance as
    the product grows rapidly.
  - Stay ahead of the curve on emerging GenAI tools and
    technologies, and apply them to solve real-world user
    problems.
  
  You'll Be Successful in This Role If You Have...
  
  - 7+ years of professional software development experience,
    with at least 2+ years building or integrating AI/ML
    systems in production environments
