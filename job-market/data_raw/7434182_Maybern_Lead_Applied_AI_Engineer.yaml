  Who We Are
  
  Maybern is transforming the way private fund managers
  effectively manage their funds through cutting edge
  technology. Maybern is founded by top engineering experts
  with deep knowledge of the fund management space.
  
  Private funds manage $15T in capital and are growing at 20%
  YoY, but with increasing regulatory scrutiny and investor
  demands for transparency, the need for world class software
  to help private fund CFOs is crucial.
  
  This is where Maybern comes in.
  
  We are equipping fund managers with intuitive, flexible fund
  management software, enabling private investment managers to
  focus on what they do best: driving returns for their
  investors. We are backed by leading venture capital firms
  and a large number of strategic investors.
  
  Maybern is an NYC based company with a strong in-office
  culture to drive collaboration, and we are looking to make
  strong additions to our team.
  
  What We're Looking For
  
  We are looking for a Senior or Staff Applied AI Engineer to
  build our implementation engineering function from the
  ground up. This role requires independence, cross-functional
  collaboration, and creativity through experimentation and
  applied AI. You’ll work closely with our internal
  implementations team to understand the systems through which
  they process years of customer data to onboard new customers
  to the Maybern platform. You’ll dig through complex problems
  and deliver elegant technical solutions and automation.
  
  This role is critical to Maybern’s success and highly
  quantifiable: faster, smoother implementations mean faster
  value for our customers and faster revenue capture for us.
  Depending on seniority and fit, this role can offer a clear
  path to team management.
  
  What You'll Do
  
  - Build and lead the Implementation Engineering team, setting
    technical vision and standards for high-impact client
    deployments.
  - Collaborate directly with our clients to understand their
    most pressing operational challenges, then design and
    build tailored solutions that address them.
  - Architect scalable systems that integrate client data,
    deeply leverage AI, and drive measurable business
    outcomes.
  - Partner closely with Product and Engineering leadership to
    influence Maybern’s roadmap based on field insights.
  - Own the end-to-end delivery of complex implementations,
    ensuring technical excellence, client satisfaction, and
    long-term success.
  
  This Could Be a Great Fit If You…
  
  - Have 6+ years of experience in software engineering with at
    least 1+ years in a technical leadership role.
  - Are curious about or open to managing a team in the future.
  - Have led in early-stage or high-growth environments, and
    know how to scale both systems and teams.
  - Have experience building internal tools for operations-heavy
    businesses.
  - Have experience influencing team and product roadmaps
    through thoughtful prioritization.
  - Are comfortable working with server-side languages and
    frameworks (we’re tech agnostic in interviews, but use
    Python and Django in practice).
  - Have experience designing and deploying large-scale systems
    that integrate data, AI/ML, or advanced analytics.
  - Bring a track record of success working directly with
    customers, executives, and technical stakeholders to
    deliver solutions.
  - Are excited to work in-office with a great team!
  
  Benefits
  
  - We offer a competitive salary + equity package,
    comprehensive benefits, and a flexible family-friendly
    work environment. Some of our perks include:
    - Comprehensive healthcare benefits
      - Maybern covers 100% of medical, dental, and vision premiums
      - HSA & FSA plans
    - Family-Friendly policies
      - Paid parental leave
