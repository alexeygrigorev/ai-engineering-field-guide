  About Netskope
  
  Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise
  than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to
  dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that
  is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever
  it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network
  and Data Security.
  
  Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security
  company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of
  employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis,
  Bangalore, London, Paris, Melbourne, Taipei, and Tokyo. Our
  core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we
  purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting
  spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration,
  and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations
  to employee recognition events and social professional
  groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we
  strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.  Visit
  us at Netskope Careers. Please follow us on LinkedIn and
  Twitter@Netskope.
  
  About the role:
  
  Please note, this team is hiring across all levels and
  candidates are individually assessed and appropriately
  leveled based upon their skills and experience.
  
  As a DevOps Engineer, you will be critical to designing,
  provisioning, and managing scalable cloud infrastructure and
  environments for our Agenti AI platform. You will
  collaborate closely with application teams to build robust
  CI/CD pipelines, ensure reliable deployments, and maintain
  highly available Kubernetes clusters. Your expertise will
  extend to Infrastructure as Code (IaC), observability,
  cluster scaling, and release management across multiple
  environments. You will ensure production environments are
  secure, scalable, and efficiently managed while continuously
  improving automation and operational excellence.
  
  What’s in it for you
  
  You will be critical to deploying and managing core
  infrastructure and platform systems that power our products.
  This means you won't just maintain existing systems; you
  will be building and standardizing foundational environments
  using Infrastructure as Code. Your role is crucial in
  enabling engineering teams to ship reliably and at scale. If
  you thrive on solving complex distributed systems
  challenges, improving deployment velocity, and operating
  large-scale Kubernetes clusters, this is the environment for
  you.
  
  What you will be doing
  
  - Work closely with the engineering team, AI/ML engineers to
    design and architect scalable, secure cloud environments
    for Agentic Applications using Infrastructure as Code
    (Terraform).
  - Design, implement, and manage CI/CD pipelines to ensure
    safe, repeatable, and reliable deployments across
    environments.
  - Manage and improve release processes including versioning,
    rollback strategies, blue/green and canary deployments.
  - Provision and manage Kubernetes clusters across multiple
    environments, ensuring high availability and scalability.
  - Implement auto-scaling strategies for infrastructure and
    workloads to optimize performance and cost.
  - Set up and manage monitoring, logging, and alerting systems
    for infrastructure and application workloads.
  - Operate and oversee large Kubernetes clusters supporting
    production workloads.
  - Improve reliability, quality, and time-to-market of our
    software delivery lifecycle.
  - Measure and optimize system performance, proactively
    identifying bottlenecks and implementing improvements.
  - Provide primary operational support and engineering for
    multiple large-scale distributed systems and cloud
    environments.
  - Operate and oversee large Kubernetes clusters with GPU
    workloads.
  
  Required skills and experience
  
  - 8+ years of professional experience building and operating
    core infrastructure systems.
  - Strong hands-on experience with Infrastructure as Code tools
    such as Terraform.
  - Deep experience with Kubernetes and container orchestration
    at scale.
  - Experience with major cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, or
    Azure).
  - Experience designing and managing CI/CD pipelines (GitHub
    Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or similar).
  - Strong scripting skills using languages like Python or Bash,
    and experience with Git and GitHub workflows.
  - Experience implementing monitoring and observability
    solutions using tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, or
    similar.
  - Proven track record of building and operating scalable,
    reliable, and secure production systems.
  - Strong troubleshooting skills across distributed systems and
    cloud-native architectures.
  - Proactive attitude in identifying reliability risks,
    performance bottlenecks, and automation opportunities.
  - Comfortable working with ambiguity and rapid change in a
    dynamic environment.
  
  - Familiarity with LLM development, deployment, and
    optimization techniques
  - Familiarity with high-performance, large-scale ML systems
    and their unique infrastructure needs.
  
  Education
  
  - BSCS or equivalent required, MSCS or equivalent strongly
    preferred
