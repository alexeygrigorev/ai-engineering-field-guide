  We are looking for an AI QA Automation Engineer (L5) to
  ensure the quality, reliability, and performance of AI-
  powered systems, including APIs, agentic workflows, and
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.
  
  This role goes beyond traditional QA automation. You will
  work at the intersection of quality engineering and AI
  systems, building automated validation frameworks for LLM-
  driven behavior and partnering closely with ML and full-
  stack teams to ship reliable AI features to production.
  
  At Proximity, you won’t just test software - you’ll help
  define how AI systems are validated, evaluated, and trusted
  at scale.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Build and maintain automation test suites for AI APIs,
    agentic workflows, and RAG-based systems.
  - Implement LLM evaluation tests, covering accuracy,
    consistency, determinism, and performance characteristics.
  - Collaborate closely with ML, backend, and full-stack
    engineering teams to validate releases and ensure
    production readiness.
  - Contribute to regression, reliability, and performance
    testing across AI and platform services.
  - Design test strategies for non-deterministic AI behavior,
    including guardrails, fallback paths, and quality
    thresholds.
  - Continuously improve test coverage, tooling, and automation
    frameworks for AI-driven systems.
  
  Requirements
  
  - 5+ years of experience in QA automation or quality
    engineering roles.
  - Strong hands-on experience with Python and/or JavaScript,
    and modern testing frameworks.
  - Experience building and maintaining API-level and
    integration test suites.
  - Ability to design robust tests for complex, distributed
    systems.
  - Familiarity with LLM- or ML-based systems and their unique
    testing challenges is strongly preferred.
  - Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with attention
    to detail.
  - Ability to work independently while collaborating
    effectively with cross-functional teams.
  
  Desired Skills:
  
  - Experience testing RAG pipelines, vector search, or AI agent
    workflows.
  - Exposure to evaluation frameworks for LLMs or ML models.
  - Familiarity with CI/CD integration for automated test
    execution.
  - Understanding of performance and load testing for backend
    services.
  
  Benefits
  
  - Best in class compensation: We hire only the best, and we
    pay accordingly.
  
  - High-impact role: Help define quality standards for
    production AI systems.
  - Proximity Talks: Learn from experts across AI, engineering,
    and product.
  
  Continuous learning: Grow your skills at the intersection of
  QA, automation, and AI.
