  About Lucidya
  
  Lucidya is a fast-growing SaaS company building AI-powered
  customer experience solutions for enterprises across the
  MENA region. Known for our deep expertise in Arabic-first
  AI, we help organizations understand, serve, and engage
  their customers at scale.
  
  We are now launching a new AI Agents business unit, focused
  on building AI Agent platforms and solutions to solve
  critical pain-points in Customer Experience - securely,
  responsibly, and at scale.
  
  About the Role
  
  As an AI Engineer specialising in Voice Agents, you will be
  responsible for designing, building, and deploying
  intelligent Voice Agents that solve real business problems.
  The Voice Agents is a key strategic pillar for the Agent AI
  business unit.
  
  This role goes beyond experimentation - you will help take
  Voice Agents from concept to production, ensuring
  performance, reliability, and business impact.
  
  You will have the opportunity to showcase your ability to
  build from 0 to a real solution that drives value
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  AI & Agent Development
  
  - Design and implement real-time voice agents using ASR, TTS,
    and LLM-based reasoning.
  - Evaluate Voice Agent providers, focussing on reliability and
    stress testing
  - Build multi-turn, stateful voice conversations with
    interruption handling (barge-in), retries, tool-use and
    fallbacks.
  - Build evaluation for AI Agent performance, ensuring that AI
    Agents are working as expected
  - Finetune and adapt STT (Speech to Text), TTS (Text to
    speech) and LLMs for different dialects
  - Contribute to the development of the Lucidya AI Agent
    platform, ensuring that Voice capability is embedded in
    the platform
  
  Production & Scalability
  
  - Deploy AI models into production environments with a focus
    on scalability, performance, and reliability.
  - Collaborate on MLOps practices to support continuous
    integration, monitoring, and improvement.
  - Work with streaming architectures (WebSockets, gRPC,
    SIP/WebRTC).
  - Analyse call logs and transcripts to continuously improve
    performance.
  - Cross-Functional Collaboration
  - Work closely with software engineers, product managers, and
    domain experts
  - Translate business problems into effective AI solutions with
    measurable outcomes.
  
  Governance & Quality
  
  - Ensure AI solutions comply with ethical standards, data
    privacy requirements, and legal regulations.
  - Document models, algorithms, workflows, and decisions
    clearly for internal and external stakeholders.
  - Stay up to date with the latest AI research, tools, and best
    practices; and apply them where valuable.
  
  RequirementsWhat we’re looking for

  - 3+ years of hands-on experience building and deploying Voice
    Agents, with a proven track-record of achieving business
    value
  - Strong programming skills in Python (Java is a plus)
  - Solid understanding of LLMs, prompt engineering, and agent
    frameworks.
  - Hands-on experience with voice systems (ASR, TTS, or
    conversational IVR).
  - Practical experience with likekit and similar
  - Experience deploying AI models into production or
    production-like environments.
  - Familiarity with speech concepts: WER, phonemes, prosody,

    AI-driven solutions.
  - Strong systems thinking, understanding how models behave in
    real-world environments.
