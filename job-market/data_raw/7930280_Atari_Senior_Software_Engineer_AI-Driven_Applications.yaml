  - Position: Senior Software Engineer (AI-Driven Applications)
  - Experience: 5+ Years
  - Location: Netaji Subhash Place, Pitampura, Delhi.
  - Employment Type: Full-Time
  
  About the Role
  
  We are seeking an exceptional Full Stack Developer (AI
  Applications) to build and scale the next generation of AI-
  driven products at Atari. This role requires deep expertise
  across the entire application stack, with a strong focus on
  integrating and optimizing Generative AI and Machine
  Learning models as core product components.
  
  The ideal candidate will bridge the gap between data science
  and product engineering — transforming data models into
  intelligent, user-facing features that enhance product
  performance, usability, and value.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Full Stack Application Development
    - Architecture & Design: Design and implement scalable, high-
      performance architectures for front-end interfaces
      (React, Vue, or Angular) and back-end microservices
      (Python/Node.js).
    - API Development: Build, document, and secure efficient
      RESTful or GraphQL APIs to enable seamless data and
      model communication across systems.
    - Data Persistence: Configure and optimize data models in
      relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and non-relational Vector
      Databases to support AI workloads.
    - Testing & CI/CD: Develop unit, integration, and end-to-end
      tests; manage deployment pipelines ensuring quality,
      stability, and reliability.
  - AI Product Integration and MLOps Focus
    - Model Implementation: Integrate Large Language Models (LLMs)
      and machine learning artifacts into production
      environments with an emphasis on latency, reliability,
      and cost efficiency.
    - RAG System Engineering: Lead the design and development of
      Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems — managing
      data chunking, embedding, indexing, and retrieval for
      contextual responses.
    - Performance Optimization: Improve AI application
      responsiveness via prompt engineering, caching, and
      inference optimization.
    - Cross-Functional Collaboration: Work closely with Data
      Scientists and MLOps Engineers to deploy, monitor, and
      continuously improve AI systems in production.
  
  Requirements
  
  - 5+ years of experience as a Full Stack Software Engineer,
    including at least 1 year of hands-on AI/ML integration
    experience.
  - Strong front-end development skills in TypeScript/JavaScript
    and frameworks like React or Next.js.
  - Advanced back-end development experience in Python
    (preferred) or Node.js, with proven ability to build
    scalable APIs.
  - Proficiency with LLM APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and
    frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex.
  - Experience with containerization (Docker) and deployment on
    major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP).
  
  Bonus Points
  
  - Hands-on experience building or maintaining RAG pipelines.
  - Exposure to vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma).
  - Familiarity with CI/CD automation for ML-integrated
    applications.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Data
    Science, or a related technical field.
  - Strong understanding of MLOps principles and AI model
    lifecycle management.
  - Familiarity with cloud-based orchestration (Kubernetes) and
    infrastructure-as-code concepts.
