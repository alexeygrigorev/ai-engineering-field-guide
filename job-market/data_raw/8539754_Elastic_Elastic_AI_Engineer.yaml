  Elastic, the Search AI Company, enables everyone to find the
  answers they need in real time, using all their data, at
  scale — unleashing the potential of businesses and people.

  At Elastic, we have a simple goal: to solve the world's data
  problems with products that delight and inspire. As the
  company behind the popular open-source projects —
  Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats — we help people
  around the world do great things with their data. From stock
  quotes to Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs,
  our products are extending what's possible with data,
  delivering on the promise that good things come from
  connecting the dots. The Elastic family unites employees
  across 40+ countries into one coherent team, while the
  broader community spans across over 100 countries.
  
  What is The Role
  
  The Elastic IT team is moving beyond simple chat to the next
  frontier: Agentic Workflows. We are looking for an
  innovative Elastic AI Engineer to join our team to build
  autonomous, enterprise-grounded agents that don't just
  answer questions—they complete complex business tasks to
  accelerate productivity across the entire organization.
  
  The ideal candidate is an Elastic product expert (including
  but not limited to Agent Builder and Workflows), using the
  full power of the Elastic Stack to provide the "brain" and
  "memory" for our agentic ecosystem.
  
  Are you ready to build the agents that supercharge
  enterprise efficiency? Join us to enable agentic workflows
  that turn collective knowledge into instant action,
  empowering everyone at Elastic to achieve more.
  
  What You Will Be Doing:
  
  - Agentic Strategy & Design: Invent and implement
    sophisticated agentic workflows that use reasoning and
    tools to complete end-to-end business processes.
  - Enterprise Grounding: Apply Retrieval Augmented Generation
    (RAG) and the Elasticsearch Relevance Engine (ESRE) to
    ensure agents are deeply grounded in enterprise knowledge
    for high-accuracy task completion.
  - AI Model & Tool Integration: Develop and fine-tune LLMs and
    integrate them with internal APIs and third-party SaaS
    tools to enable autonomous action.
  - Scalable Infrastructure: Firm understanding of cloud-based
    environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) in order to support the
    high-concurrency demands of enterprise agents.
  - Lifecycle Management: Oversee the training, deployment, and
    performance optimization of agents, ensuring they remain
    secure, reliable, and compliant.
  - Technical Leadership: Act as a domain expert on the Elastic
    Stack, making technical recommendations that push the
    boundaries of AI-driven productivity.
  - Documentation: Maintain comprehensive documentation of AI
    workflows, cloud infrastructure, and deployment processes.
  - Security: Implement standards for security and data privacy
    to protect sensitive information and ensure compliance
    with relevant regulations.
  
  What you bring:
  
  - 3-5 years of work experience in a relevant field.
  - Minimum 1 year experience building with the Elastic Stack.
  - Knowledge of Elasticsearch Relevance Engine (ESRE), Jina AI,
    and advanced RAG patterns is critical.
  - Proven success in delivering independent GenAI projects,
    specifically those involving autonomous task completion or
    complex workflow automation.
  - Agentic Frameworks: Familiarity with LangGraph, LangChain,
    and LangSmith for building and debugging multi-agent
    systems.
  - Expertise in Enterprise Agentic & Workflow Platforms: Deep
    familiarity with leading agentic AI and workflow
    automation platforms (such as Microsoft Copilot Studio,
    Salesforce Agentforce, ServiceNow AI Agents.)
  - Market Trend Integration: Proven ability to apply emerging
    market trends—such as Multi-Agent Orchestration and Model
    Context Protocol (MCP)—to build high-impact, cost-
    optimized solutions that scale across the enterprise.
  - Programming: Experience with Python or TypeScript for
    backend logic and agent orchestration.
  - Cloud & Orchestration: Familiarity with Kubernetes
    (Operators/Controllers), Docker, and Terraform for
    automated deployment.
  - Model Expertise: Hands-on experience with LLM providers.
  
  Bonus Points
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science or a
    related engineering field.
  - Strong communication skills with the ability to translate
    business requirements into technical agent architectures.
  - A commitment to Ethical AI and responsible development
    practices.
  - Experience with containerization and orchestration (e.g.,
    Docker, Kubernetes).
  - Knowledge of DevOps practices for model deployment and
    automation.
