  Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?
  
  At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in
  the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that
  demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging
  onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial
  system.
  
  To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific
  candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our
  mission and who believes in the power of crypto and
  blockchain technology to update the financial system. We
  want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world,
  who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high
  caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep
  leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away
  from, solving the company’s hardest problems.
  
  Our work culture is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if
  you want to build the future alongside others who excel in
  their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no
  better place to be.
  
  While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not
  remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout
  the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple
  times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and
  alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.
  
  We are looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer to
  join our Risk AI/ML team. We are dedicated to building the
  sophisticated models that protect our customers and make
  Coinbase the most trusted platform in crypto. Your work will
  directly prevent fraud, account takeovers, and scams, while
  enabling future products like instant guest checkout and
  Coinbase Cards.
  
  This is a hands-on technical role where you will leverage
  our cutting-edge, self-service ML platform to rapidly
  design, deploy, and iterate on the models that defend
  millions of users.
  
  What you’ll be doing (ie. job duties):
  
  - Own a Critical Risk Domain: Take full technical ownership of
    a core problem space, such as Scams or Account Takeover.
    You will design, build, and lead the strategy for all
    models in this domain.
  - Architect and Design Systems: Lead the system design and
    architecture for new, complex risk detection models. This
    includes everything from feature pipeline design to model
    selection (e.g., GNNs, LSTMs, LLMs) and high-performance
    serving.
  - Drive the Technical Roadmap: Work with Product, Ops, and
    other stakeholders to translate ambiguous business needs
    into a clear technical roadmap. You will be the primary
    technical voice defining the "how."
  - Mentor and Lead: Act as a technical leader and mentor for
    mid-level and junior engineers on the team. You will lead
    by example through code reviews, design docs, and
    coaching.
  - Apply Advanced ML: Apply modern methodologies (e.g., deep
    learning, NLP, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), sequence
    modeling, and LLMs for NLP and conversational agents) to
    solve complex, crypto-native challenges.
  - Build Context-Aware Risk Systems: Architect the adaptive
    logic that decides which friction (a quiz, an LLM agent, a
    human review) to apply to which user, balancing security
    with user experience.
  
  What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):
  
  - 5+ years of working experience in software engineering
    and/or AI/ML, with experience deploying AI/ML systems into
    production.
  - Proven track record of technical leadership, including
    designing and deploying large-scale ML systems from
    scratch.
  - A commitment to building an open financial system and a
    strong desire to protect users from fraud and scams. You
    embody our core cultural values: add positive energy,
    communicate clearly, be curious, and be a builder.
  - Deep expertise in applied AI/ML techniques (e.g., Risk ML,
    deep learning, NLP, recommender systems, anomaly
    detection).
  - Expert-level coding skills (e.g., Python) and deep
    experience with AI/ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
    Experience in building backend systems with a focus on
    data processing or analytics is a plus.
  - Ability to work collaboratively on technical initiatives and
    contribute to impactful AI/ML solutions.
  - Strong communication skills, with the ability to convey
    technical concepts to both technical and non-technical
    audiences.
  
  Nice to haves:
  
  - Master’s / Ph.D in Computer Science, AI/ML, Data Science, or
    a related field.
  - Familiarity with modern data and AI/ML infrastructure (e.g.,
    Feature Stores like Tecton, Model Serving like RayServe,
    Apache Airflow, Spark, Kafka).
  - Experience with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or Sequential
    Models (like LSTMs).
  - Experience with LLMs (NLP, fine-tuning, agentic systems) or
    Reinforcement Learning.
  - Understanding of MLOps best practices, including monitoring
    and improving production models.
  - Experience with data analysis and visualization tools.
