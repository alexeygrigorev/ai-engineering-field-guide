  Who We Are
  
  At RelationalAI, we’re solving one of the most important
  challenges in artificial intelligence: how to teach large
  language models the logic, semantics, and business context
  of the modern enterprise.
  
  Frontier models are trained almost entirely on public data —
  they can speak about the world, but they don’t understand
  your business. We fix that.
  
  RelationalAI has pioneered a breakthrough called
  Superalignment — technology that enables LLMs to learn
  natively from private, structured enterprise data inside the
  data cloud.
  
  By combining this with relational knowledge graphs and our
  proprietary neuro/symbolic-relational reasoners, we deliver
  trustworthy decision intelligence: systems that use semantic
  models to truly understand how a business operates and can
  reason across its data to drive better outcomes.
  
  We’re a globally distributed team of engineers, scientists,
  and builders redefining how AI learns from data. We believe
  that high-stakes decisions deserve frontier intelligence —
  intelligence that’s explainable, aligned, and grounded in
  reality.
  
  If you’re driven by curiosity, thrive in complexity, and
  want to help build the system that brings true understanding
  to enterprise AI, you’ll feel right at home here.
