  surface. We are committed to a remote first culture.
  
  QA Lead Engineer (AI-First Engineering Organization)Overview
  
  We are seeking an experienced QA Lead Engineer to drive
  quality strategy and execution within an AI-first
  development organization. This is not a traditional QA lead
  role — we are looking for a hands-on technical leader who
  can architect and implement an automated, AI-first quality
  framework that scales with modern software development.
  
  In our environment, AI is a first-class partner in software
  creation. The QA Lead Engineer will define how quality is
  engineered into the product using automation, AI agents, and
  deep collaboration with Product and Engineering.
  
  If you have over a decade of QA automation experience and
  are excited about redefining what quality means in an AI-
  native development lifecycle, we want to talk to you.
  
  What You’ll DoQuality Strategy & Technical Leadership
  
  - Define and own the end-to-end QA strategy for an AI-first
    engineering team.
  - Architect scalable, fully automated testing frameworks
    across backend, frontend, APIs, and AI-powered features.
  - Lead the transition from traditional QA practices to AI-
    driven quality engineering.
  - Establish quality metrics, SLAs, and measurable standards
    across the product lifecycle.
  - Serve as the technical authority on testing architecture,
    tooling, and best practices.
  
  AI-Driven QA & Automation
  
  - Design and implement AI-agent-driven QA workflows (e.g.,
    autonomous test generation, regression validation,
    autonomous testing agents).
  - Integrate LLM-based or AI-assisted tooling into CI/CD
    pipelines.
  - Leverage AI to improve test coverage, defect detection, root
    cause analysis, and release confidence.
  - Evaluate and introduce emerging AI QA tooling and
    frameworks.
  - Develop strategies for testing AI-based product features
    (e.g., model behavior validation, output consistency,
    guardrail enforcement).
  
  Cross-Functional Quality Ownership
  
  - Partner closely with Product to define acceptance criteria,
    quality gates, and risk assessments.
  - Work with Engineering leadership to embed quality earlier in
    the development lifecycle.
  - Drive a culture where developers co-own quality and
    automation.
  - Lead post-incident quality reviews and implement systemic
    improvements.
  - Define and standardize quality processes across squads.
  
  Hands-On Execution
  
  - Leverage AI to build autonomous QA systems that understand
    the context of product decisions, and use that context to
    drive the highest quality
  - Build frameworks and reusable testing infrastructure.
  - Mentor engineers on best practices in automation and AI-
    driven testing.
  
  What We’re Looking ForRequired Experience
  
  - 10+ years of experience in QA engineering, with deep
    expertise in automation.
  - Demonstrated thought leadership and hands on implementation
    experience with creating AI-driven Agentic quality
    systems.
  - Proven experience designing and implementing automated test
    frameworks at scale.
  - Strong programming skills (e.g., Python,
    JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, or similar).
  - Experience with Cloud based CI/CD systems and modern DevOps
    practices.
  - Demonstrated technical leadership in cross-functional teams.
  
  AI & Modern QA Experience
  
  - Experience using AI tools and agents in development
    workflows.
  - Deep experience with AI Agents and LLMs and how to test AI-
    driven systems.
  - Experience with autonomous test generation or AI-assisted
    test maintenance is highly desirable.
  - Understanding of challenges specific to testing AI systems
    (non-determinism, hallucination, evaluation frameworks).
  
  Leadership & Influence
  
  - Strong communication skills with the ability to influence
    Product and Engineering leaders.
  - Experience driving process improvements across teams.
  - Ability to operate strategically while remaining hands-on.
  - A mindset focused on systems thinking, scalability, and
    continuous improvement.
  
  What Success Looks Like
  
  - QA is largely automated and AI-driven.
  - Quality metrics are visible, measurable, and improving.
  - Developers rely on AI-driven test systems as part of daily
    workflows.
  - Release confidence is high with reduced regression rates.
  - Quality is embedded into the product lifecycle, not bolted
    on.
  
  Why This Role Is Unique
  
  You will help define what QA looks like in an AI-first
  organization. This role goes beyond writing tests — it is
  about designing a quality system where AI agents collaborate
  with engineers to proactively identify, prevent, and fix
  defects.
  
  This is an opportunity to lead the evolution of quality
  engineering.
  
  Compensation
  
  Our salary ranges are categorized into two tiers based on
  geographic location:
  
  - Tier 1 (San Francisco, New York, Seattle): $140,000 -
    $160,000
  - Tier 2 (All Other Locations): $120,000 - $150,000
  
  The final base salary will be determined by experience,
  skill set, and specific location. In addition to base pay,
  this role is eligible for equity and benefits.
