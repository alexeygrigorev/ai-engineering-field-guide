  law.
  
  About us
  
  Founded in 2017, Wayve is the leading developer of Embodied
  AI technology.  Our advanced AI software and foundation
  models enable vehicles to perceive, understand, and navigate
  any complex environment, enhancing the usability and safety
  of automated driving systems.
  
  Our vision is to create autonomy that propels the world
  forward.  Our intelligent, mapless, and hardware-agnostic AI
  products are designed for automakers, accelerating the
  transition from assisted to automated driving.   In our
  fast-paced environment big problems ignite us—we embrace
  uncertainty, leaning into complex challenges to unlock
  groundbreaking solutions. We aim high and stay humble in our
  pursuit of excellence, constantly learning and evolving as
  we pave the way for a smarter, safer future.
  
  At Wayve, your contributions matter.  We value diversity,
  embrace new perspectives, and foster an inclusive work
  environment; we back each other to deliver impact.
  
  Make Wayve the experience that defines your career!
  
  The role
  
  Science is the team that is advancing our end-to-end
  autonomous driving research. The team’s mission is to
  accelerate our journey to AV2.0 and ensure the future
  success of Wayve by incubating and investing in new ideas
  that have the potential to become game-changing
  technological advances for the company.
  
   The goal of this role is to build, scale, and optimise
  next-generation world model architectures (e.g. GAIA and
  successors) and bridge them into high-throughput training
  infrastructure, enabling synthetic data and simulation to
  dramatically accelerate autonomy development. You’ll design
  systems to acquire, process, and curate multimodal data at
  scale. You’ll turn raw experience into the high-quality
  datasets that fuel our models.
  
  You’ll sit at the intersection of machine learning research
  and data engineering, collaborating closely with scientists
  and infrastructure teams to ensure our workflows are robust,
  efficient, and deeply integrated with our model training
  stack.
  
  Your work will directly impact how quickly and effectively
  we can train, evaluate, and deploy embodied AI systems in
  the real world.
  
  Key responsibilities:
  
  - Design and implement large-scale data acquisition,
    processing, and curation pipelines, owning the full
    lifecycle of high-quality datasets used to train advanced
    robotics and foundation models.
  - Continuously improve dataset quality and utility through
    sophisticated data analysis, debugging, and
    experimentation; developing metrics, tests, and monitoring
    mechanisms that directly drive model performance
    improvements.
  - Develop and scale multimodal data pipelines for ingestion,
    preprocessing, filtering, annotation, and storage across
    video, LiDAR, and telemetry modalities.
  - Run systematic experiments on data ablations and composition
    to assess their impact on model training dynamics,
    generalisation, and downstream performance.
  - Collaborate with ML researchers and platform engineers to
    ensure datasets are fit for purpose and efficiently
    integrated into large-scale training workflows.
  - Build internal tools and workflows for dataset auditing,
    visualization, and versioning to streamline iteration and
    reproducibility.
  - Advance best practices for data governance, reliability, and
    scalability across the data lifecycle; ensuring data
    safety, privacy, and long-term maintainability.
  
  About you
  
  To set you up for success as a Senior MLE at Wayve, we’re
  looking for the following skills and experience:
  
  - Experience in ML engineering, data engineering, or applied
    ML roles focused on large-scale data systems.
  - Proven experience building and maintaining large-scale data
    pipelines for machine learning, including data ingestion,
    transformation, and validation.
  - Strong Python fundamentals and experience with modern ML and
    data frameworks (e.g. PyTorch, Ray, Dask, Spark, or
    equivalent).
  - Solid understanding of multimodal data (video, lidar, sensor
    telemetry) and its challenges in large-scale training.
  - Experience defining and tracking data quality metrics,
    conducting dataset analysis, and driving data-informed
    improvements in model performance.
  - Demonstrated ability to work collaboratively with ML
    researchers, platform engineers, and product teams in a
    fast-paced, experimental environment.
  - Strong problem-solving skills, a data-driven mindset, and
    the ability to translate research needs into reliable data
    solutions.
  
  Desirable
  
  - Exposure to large-scale storage, distributed training
    systems, or cloud compute environments (Azure, AWS, GCP).
  - Experience designing high-throughput, distributed data
    pipelines (e.g. with Spark, Ray, Beam, or similar
    frameworks).
  - Familiarity with data versioning, lineage, and governance
    tools (e.g. LakeFS, DVC, MLflow, Delta Lake).
  - Experience in AVs, robotics, simulation, or other embodied
    AI domains.
  - Familiarity with foundation models, generative models, or
    simulation-based data pipelines.
  
  Why Join Us
  
  - Shape the future of embodied AI through data. Your work will
    directly determine the quality, scale, and impact of the
    foundation models that drive our autonomy systems.
  - Tackle data challenges at unprecedented scale. Work with
    petabytes of multimodal data — video, lidar, and telemetry
    — and build pipelines that enable training at the frontier
    of AI.
  - Collaborate with world-class talent. Partner with leading ML
    researchers, software engineers, and data scientists who
    are redefining how AI learns from real-world experience.
  - Make your mark on real-world autonomy. Your data systems
    will power models that see, understand, and act in the
    world.
  - Work in a high-trust, high-autonomy environment. We value
    creativity, experimentation, and rigorous thinking. You’ll
    have the freedom to explore bold ideas and the support to
    make them real.
