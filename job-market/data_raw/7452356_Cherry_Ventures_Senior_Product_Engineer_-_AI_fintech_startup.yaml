  About the job
  
  Payments might seem slick for consumers, but businesses
  still trade with each other manually. Every year, millions
  of people work to exchange documents, emails and phone
  calls, and send checks and bank transfers worth tens of
  trillions of dollars.
  
  Lunos is transforming this sleepy world of B2B payments,
  starting with an AI partner that ensures businesses get paid
  by managing their receivables just like a human would. Well,
  how they would if they worked on it 24/7, never forgot
  anything and read every message ever sent to them.
  
  We’re a small team with big ambitions, backed by General
  Catalyst & Cherry Ventures who were early backers of
  companies like Stripe and Airbnb. We recently raised $5M in
  our pre-seed round.
  
  We’re building in a modern stack (TypeScript, Next.js,
  Vercel, Supabase/Postgres, Tailwind), blending powerful
  agentic AI architectures, curated LLM pipelines,
  quantitative methods and robust SaaS foundations.
  
  We’re looking for Senior Product Engineers who:
  
  - Are deeply curious and passionate about building products
    users truly love
  - Get frustrated when things don’t move fast enough
  - Want their voice to shape product decisions, tech choices,
    and company culture
  - Enjoy the freedom and challenge of working across the stack,
    from intuitive UX and robust API design to AI
    architectures and prompt engineering
  - Believe AI is fundamentally reshaping the world - and want
    to be part of it
  
  Sound like your kind of adventure?
  
  Let’s talk. 🚀
