  Who we are
  
  Helsing is a defence AI company. Our mission is to protect
  our democracies. We aim to achieve technological leadership,
  so that open societies can continue to make sovereign
  decisions and control their ethical standards. As
  democracies, we believe we have a special responsibility to
  be thoughtful about the development and deployment of
  powerful technologies like AI. We take this responsibility
  seriously. We are an ambitious and committed team of
  engineers, AI specialists and customer-facing programme
  managers. We are looking for mission-driven people to join
  our European teams – and apply their skills to solve the
  most complex and impactful problems. We embrace an open and
  transparent culture that welcomes healthy debates on the use
  of technology in defence, its benefits, and its ethical
  implications.
  
  The role
  
  At Helsing, we are pioneering the future of autonomous
  decision-making for defence. Our work spans the full AI
  landscape, including high-volume data processing, RL agent
  training, and large-scale foundation models. As a member of
  a cross-functional team, you will architect and implement
  the tools and platforms that enable these breakthroughs.
  Your focus will be on abstracting complex distributed
  systems to maximise training throughput and developer
  velocity. We are looking for engineers who can navigate the
  convergence of machine learning and systems engineering to
  build robust, scalable platforms.
  
  What you will do:
  
  - Extend our highly integrated deep learning frameworks (built
    on top of PyTorch), making them efficient and easy to use
    for a wide range of use cases.
  - Scale our current infrastructure and tooling stack to
    support faster and larger distributed training.
  - Design data strategy to support large scale datasets and
    efficient storage, ensuring GPUs stay warm.
  
  You should apply if you:
  
  - Hold an MSc or PhD in Computer Science or STEM field, with a
    focus on Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
  - Have strong software engineering skills in Python and
    fluency with modern DL frameworks
    (PyTorch/JAX/TensorFlow). You don’t just import libraries;
    you are comfortable writing custom layers, loss functions,
    and distributed training loops.
  - Are a clear communicator who can build from complex
    theoretical concepts and contribute to the company's
    internal engineering culture.
  - Have a "first-principles" mindset: you enjoy reading the
    latest AI optimisation blog posts and integrating them
    into codebases rapidly.
  - You have debugged production ML pipelines and can tell a
    good war story about finding a subtle numerical or
    performance issue.
  
  Note: We operate at an intersection where women, as well as
  other minority groups, are systematically under-represented.
  We encourage you to apply even if you don’t meet all the
  listed qualifications; ability and impact cannot be
  summarised in a few bullet points.
  
  Nice to have
  
  - You have hands-on experience training models on large-scale
    GPU clusters, implementing advanced parallelism
    strategies, and understanding the underlying cross-node
    communication patterns (NCCL, MPI).
  - You have worked with large-scale datasets made of different
    modalities. Understanding the tradeoffs in locality,
    encoding, formats, and streaming strategies.
  - You are proficient with workload orchestrators like Slurm,
    Kubernetes, or Ray, having used them to schedule and
    manage complex, concurrent training jobs at scale.
  - You understand GPU architecture at a low level: memory
    hierarchies, warp execution, and what makes a GPU suited
    for training versus inference workloads.
  
  Join Helsing and work with world-leading experts in their
  fields
  
  - Helsing’s work is important. You’ll be directly contributing
    to the protection of democratic countries while balancing
    both ethical and geopolitical concerns.
  - The work is unique. We operate in a domain that has highly
    unusual technical requirements and constraints, and where
    robustness, safety, and ethical considerations are vital.
    You will face unique Engineering and AI challenges that
    make a meaningful impact in the world.
  - Our work frequently takes us right up to the state of the
    art in technical innovation, be it reinforcement learning,
    distributed systems, generative AI, or deployment
    infrastructure. The defence industry is entering the most
    exciting phase of the technological development curve.
    Advances in our field of world are not incremental:
    Helsing is part of, and often leading, historic leaps
    forward.
  - In our domain, success is a matter of order-of-magnitude
    improvements and novel capabilities. This means we take
    bets, aim high, and focus on big opportunities. Despite
    being a relatively young company, Helsing has already been
    selected for multiple significant government contracts.
  - We actively encourage healthy, proactive, and diverse debate
    internally about what we do and how we choose to do it.
    Teams and individual engineers are trusted (and
    encouraged) to practise responsible autonomy and critical
    thinking, and to focus on outcomes, not conformity. At
    Helsing you will have a say in how we (and you!) work, the
    opportunity to engage on what does and doesn’t work, and
    to take ownership of aspects of our culture that you care
    deeply about.
  
  What we offer
  
  - A focus on outcomes, not time-tracking
  - Competitive compensation and stock options
  - Relocation support
  - Social and education allowances
  - Regular company events and all-hands to bring together
    employees as one team across Europe
  - A hands-on onboarding program (affectionately labelled “AI-
    duction”), in which you will be familiarising yourself
    with our tools and ML pipelines used across the company.
    This is your opportunity to learn our tech stack, explore
    the company, and learn how we get things done - all whilst
    working with other AI and engineering teams from day one
  
  Helsing is an equal opportunities employer. We are committed
  to equal employment opportunity regardless of race,
  religion, sexual orientation, age, marital status,
  disability or gender identity. Please do not submit personal
  data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
  religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership,
  data concerning your health, or data concerning your sexual
  orientation.
