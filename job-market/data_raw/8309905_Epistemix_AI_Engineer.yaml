description: |
  The AI Engineer plays a critical role in making modeling and
  simulation accessible to non-data scientists. You will be
  designing, developing, and deploying AI-driven applications
  to make our software more accessible which will have a
  direct impact on the number of organizations we are able to
  serve. This position plays a critical role in our product
  roadmap and will directly contribute to the company's
  success and growth. Ideal candidates exhibit a high
  willingness to experiment and empathy for users.
  
  About Epistemix
  
  Epistemix helps organizations forecast outcomes and manage
  risk by modeling how people behave. Our platform consists of
  two core products: Populus, which provides access to
  realistic, high-resolution synthetic population data, and
  Polaris, which enables scenario planning through advanced
  data science and simulation. Together, they empower
  customers to evaluate the potential impact of strategies
  before deploying them in the real world.
  
  Organizations across healthcare, consumer industries,
  insurance, and government use Epistemix to reduce
  uncertainty, optimize decisions, and accelerate time to
  value. Whether estimating total addressable market, testing
  public health interventions, or forecasting behavior change,
  our tools help teams make confident decisions when pre-
  existing data may not exist.
  
  Leading up to our Series B financing, we are hiring key
  roles onto the team and entering an exciting phase of growth
  and innovation. Join us to combine cutting-edge technology
  with a purpose-driven mission to make the world a better
  place.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Craft clean, testable, and maintainable code to enable AI-
    generated agent-based models.
  - Own the software from requirements development through

    generate agent-based models that address critical business
    questions and data scientists to build agent-based models
    more quickly that answer the questions of decision makers.
  - Design, build, test, and deploy a scalable system
    architecture so that AI-generated models can be validated
    by data scientists and deliver results back to decision
    makers quickly.
  - Own the engineering solution and collaborate with internal
