  At OneStudyTeam (a Reify Health company), we specialize in
  speeding up clinical trials and increasing the chance of new
  therapies being approved with the ultimate goal of improving
  patient outcomes. Our cloud-based platform, StudyTeam,
  brings research site workflows online and enables sites,
  sponsors, and other key stakeholders to work together more
  effectively. StudyTeam is trusted by the largest global
  biopharmaceutical companies, used in over 6,000 research
  sites, and is available in over 100 countries. Join us in
  our mission to advance clinical research and improve patient
  care.
  
  One mission. One team. That’s OneStudyTeam.
  
  As a Principal Engineer, AI Systems, you will serve as the
  organization's senior expert in the implementation,
  integration, and operational enablement of Artificial
  Intelligence systems. You will guide the deployment and
  support of OpenAI ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, internally
  developed AI-enabled solutions, and other large language
  model (LLM) technologies across the enterprise.
  
  This role blends strategy and execution. You will work
  cross-functionally with engineering, operations, security,
  and business teams to identify AI-driven efficiency
  opportunities, implement solutions, and establish governance
  practices that ensure safe, compliant, and ethical use of
  AI.
  
  You will operate as a hybrid product manager, systems
  engineer, DevOps engineer, and enterprise AI advisor,
  shaping the organization's approach to intelligent
  automation and advanced tooling.
  
  What You’ll Be Working On:
  
  - AI Enablement and Strategy: Lead organization-wide AI
    adoption and enablement initiatives. Identify
    opportunities to leverage AI tools to improve efficiency,
    accuracy, and productivity across business units.
  - Solution Design and Prototyping: Architect, configure, and
    prototype solutions using LLMs, APIs, and orchestration
    tools. Develop proof-of-concepts for department-specific
    AI use cases.
  - Systems Integration: Integrate AI capabilities into existing
    applications, workflows, and cloud environments (e.g.,
    Azure, AWS). Manage connections between enterprise systems
    and AI platforms through APIs or automation layers.
  - AI Platform Management: Oversee configuration and
    operational support of platforms such as OpenAI,
    Anthropic, Zapier, and Make.
  - Security and Compliance Oversight: Ensure AI implementations
    adhere to internal policies and external standards,
    including HIPAA, ISO 27001/27002, and internal data
    governance frameworks.
  - Responsible AI and Risk Management: Implement and promote
    compliance with frameworks such as NIST AI RMF 1.0 and the
    EU AI Act. Conduct AI risk assessments and recommend
    mitigation controls.
  - Cross-Functional Collaboration: Partner with department
    heads and technical teams to evaluate requirements,
    recommend AI-enabled tools, and support implementation.
  - Education and Advocacy: Serve as a trusted AI advisor to
    business and technical leaders. Provide internal guidance,
    training, and documentation on AI tool usage, safety, and
    best practices.
  - Performance Monitoring: Establish metrics to evaluate AI-
    driven efficiency gains, user adoption, and business
    impact.
  - Vendor and Tool Evaluation: Continuously research, evaluate,
    and recommend new AI tools, frameworks, and integration
    strategies aligned with enterprise goals.
