  AI Solutions Developer, FinanceWho we areAbout Stripe
  
  Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for
  businesses. Millions of companies—from the world's largest
  enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to
  accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new
  business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP
  of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work
  ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to
  put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing
  the most important work of your career.
  
  About the team
  
  You'll be joining the Finance Operational Excellence team,
  reporting to the Finance AI Solution Architect. Our mission
  is to operationalize AI agents at scale for Finance,
  supporting the AI Strategy to transform how Finance teams
  work. We sit at the intersection of Finance domain
  expertise, data engineering, and emerging AI technologies.
  
  We serve as Global AI Solution Architects for Finance,
  working with domain AI leaders and SMEs across
  Controllership, F&S, Treasury, Tax, Finance Operations and
  Facilities. Our goal is not just to build AI solutions, but
  to operationalize them—handing off agents to Finance teams
  for long-term ownership and adaptation.  This means we teach
  while we work. Engineering partners help with complex
  technical work and custom tool development, while we deliver
  solutions using Agentic AI and other emerging AI tools.
  
  We work within platform constraints creatively, build
  reusable knowledge layers, and enable Finance teams to
  maintain AI solutions independently. We have deep expertise
  in data analysis, process digitalization and applied AI.  If
  you have a passion for technology and problem solving, and
  are excited about the future of AI at work, keep reading.
  
  What you'll do
  
  You'll work side-by-side with Finance, Product, and
  Engineering teams to build and operationalize AI-powered
  automation solutions that transform how Finance teams work
  at Stripe. You'll work independently to automate manual
  processes, design and build agents and required data
  solutions using internal platforms, and enable Finance teams
  to maintain these solutions long-term.
  
  You'll collaborate closely with Finance subject matter
  experts to understand their workflows, translate
  requirements into technical solutions, and iterate based on
  feedback. When you encounter platform limitations—which you
  will—you'll find creative workarounds, collaborate with
  Engineering to scope and test custom tools, and escalate
  strategically when needed. You'll establish reusable
  components to accelerate the portfolio of Finance AI use
  cases.
  
  This role requires a blend of process automation, data
  operations, technical problem-solving, and stakeholder
  enablement. You'll spend your time building agents,
  optimizing data pipelines that feed them, creating knowledge
  layers that make them more accurate, and training Finance
  teams to use and maintain them. Success means Finance teams
  can independently run agents you've built while you provide
  light support and focus on the next automation opportunity.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Build and operationalize AI agents for Finance use cases
    using Agentic Solutions and other automation tools,
    delivering end-to-end solutions from prototype to handoff
  - Design reusable knowledge layers, validation patterns, and
    data quality frameworks to improve agent accuracy and
    reliability across multiple use cases
  - Identify agentic limitations and new possibilities;
    collaborate with Engineering to scope custom tools and
    integrations (via MCP) when capabilities are insufficient,
    providing requirements, testing implementations, and
    integrating tools into agent workflows
  - Work independently to scope automation opportunities,
    navigate platform constraints through creative workarounds
    (pre-coded tools, query chaining, validation agents), and
    strike a balance between speed and quality to deliver
    impact quickly
  - Enable Finance teams through training, documentation (SOPs,
    runbooks), and self-service tooling for minimal ongoing
    support
  - Be the accountable technical expert with Finance SMEs across
    multiple organizations to understand manual processes,
    translate requirements into technical solutions, and
    iterate based on feedback
  - Write and optimize SQL queries for data extraction,
    transformation, and validation that feed agent workflows,
    ensuring data quality and accuracy for Finance use cases
  - Establish monitoring and observability for deployed agents,
    including metrics, alerting, and incident response
    processes to ensure reliability
  - Serve as the escalation point for technical issues,
    diagnosing problems independently and collaborating with
    Engineering when solutions require deeper platform changes
  - Document learnings, patterns, and best practice news
    bulletins for reuse across the Finance AI portfolio,
    contributing to organizational knowledge and scaling
    impact
