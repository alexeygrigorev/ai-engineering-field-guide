  HOW WE LIVE OUR VALUES TO OUR TEAMMATES:
  
  We’re seeking those with passion for healthcare and
  relentless devotion to our goal. We need team members that
  embody our following core values:
  
  1) We are human, first Our humanity binds us together. We
  bring the same empathetic approach to every individual we
  engage with, whether it be our members, our clients, or each
  other. We are all worthy of respect and understanding and we
  engage in our interactions with care and intention. We honor
  our stories. We listen to—and hear—each other, we celebrate
  our differences and similarities, we are present for each
  other, and we strive for mutual understanding.
  
  2) We redefine what is possible We always look beyond the
  obstacles in front of us to imagine new solutions. We
  approach our work with inspiration from other industries,
  other leaders, and other challenges. We use ingenuity and
  resourcefulness when faced with tough problems.
  
  3) We debate then commit We believe that a spirit of open
  discourse is part of a healthy culture. We understand and
  appreciate different perspectives and we challenge our
  assumptions. When working toward a decision or a new
  solution, we actively listen to one another, approach it
  with a “yes, and” mentality, and assume positive intent.
  Once a decision is made, we align and champion it as one
  team.
  
  4) We cultivate grit Changing healthcare doesn’t happen
  overnight. We reflect and learn from challenges and approach
  the future with a determination to strive for better. In the
  face of daunting situations, we value persistence. We
  embrace failure as a stepping stone to future success. On
  this journey, we seek to act with guts, resilience,
  initiative, and tenacity.
  
  5) We seek to delight Healthcare is complicated and
  personal. We work tirelessly to meet the goals of our
  clients while also delivering the best experience to our
  members. We recognize that no matter the role or team, we
  each play a crucial part in our members’ care and take that
  responsibility seriously. When faced with an obstacle, we
  are kind, respectful, and solution-oriented in our approach.
  We hold ourselves accountable to our clients and our
  members’ success.
