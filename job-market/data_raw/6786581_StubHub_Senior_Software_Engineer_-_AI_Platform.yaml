  StubHub is on a mission to redefine the live event
  experience on a global scale. Whether someone is looking to

  We’re looking for experienced AI Engineers to lead the
  development and implementation of AI-driven capabilities
  across our organization. This role is critical in
  introducing cutting-edge AI tooling, defining and scaling
  best practices, and building custom models that solve real
  business problems. You’ll partner closely with cross-
  functional teams to identify high-impact use cases,
  architect and deploy robust AI solutions, and help shape the
  company’s broader AI strategy. The ideal candidate blends
  deep technical expertise in machine learning, LLMs, and
  MLOps with the ability to think strategically, influence
  stakeholders, and deliver scalable, production-ready systems
  that create measurable value for the business.
