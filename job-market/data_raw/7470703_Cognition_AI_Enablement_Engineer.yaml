  We are an applied AI lab building end-to-end software
  agents.
  
  We're the makers of Devin, the first AI software engineer,
  and Windsurf, the AI-native IDE. Together, they represent
  our vision for collaborative AI teammates that enable
  engineers to focus on more interesting problems and empower
  teams to strive for more ambitious goals.
  
  Our team is small and talent-dense. Among our founding team,
  we have world-class competitive programmers, former
  founders, and leaders from companies at the cutting edge of
  AI including Scale AI, Palantir, Cursor, Waymo, Tesla,
  Lunchclub, Modal, Google DeepMind, and Nuro.
  
  Building Devin and Windsurf is just the first step—our
  hardest challenges still lie ahead. If you’re excited to
  solve some of the world’s biggest problems and build AI that
  can reason on real-world tasks, apply to join us.
  
  About the Role
  
  Cognition’s AI Enablement Engineers help teams adopt Devin
  and integrate agentic workflows into their day-to-day
  development. They combine deep technical expertise,
  consulting intuition, and a teacher’s mindset to guide teams
  through real work—building software alongside them while
  teaching how to use Devin to do the same.
  
  As one of the first AI Enablement Engineers, you’ll also
  play a key role in shaping how the program scales
  globally—turning individual training engagements into
  repeatable playbooks, digital learning content, and partner-
  driven enablement models that allow Cognition to reach
  hundreds of thousands of engineers worldwide. You’ll help
  define how AI Enablement becomes a product in itself:
  structured, measurable, and continuously improving in
  impact.
  
  This role is perfect for someone who has strong engineering
  fundamentals, enjoys working directly with customers, and
  finds deep satisfaction in teaching others and unlocking
  their potential—while also thinking systematically about how
  to scale those learnings to the next 100 teams.
  
  In this role, you will:
  
  - Lead interactive programs for enterprise engineering teams
    (live workshops, pair programming sessions)
  - Guide customers through installing, configuring, and
    optimizing Devin and its associated tools (DeepWiki, MCP
    integrations, etc.)
  - Pair-program with engineers at varying experience levels,
    helping them build, debug, and automate real projects
  - Identify high-ROI workflows for Devin across engineering,
    QA, support, data, and product teams
  - Create enablement materials, best practices, and shared
    playbooks based on customer learnings
  - Work with leadership to scale AI Enablement into a
    repeatable and productized offering—through digital
    learning content, partner certifications, and scalable
    training models
  - Collaborate with Cognition Engagement Managers and
    Engineering teams to continuously refine onboarding and
    provide feedback on new features
  
  Requirements for the Role:
  
  - Degree in a STEM field or equivalent hands-on experience
  - 3+ years as a software engineer or technical consultant with
    strong coding proficiency (Python, JavaScript/TypeScript,
    or similar)
  - Proven ability to communicate complex technical topics to
    diverse audiences
  - Strong customer-service orientation and ability to thrive in
    interactive, people-facing environments
  - Excellent verbal and written communication skills
  - Demonstrated ability to learn and adapt exceptionally fast
  
  You might excel if you…
  
  - Have experience leading technical workshops, internal
    enablement programs, or developer onboarding initiatives
  - Have deployed or integrated LLM or agent-based systems in
    production settings
  - Are energized by teaching, coaching, and helping others
    reach “aha” moments
  - Have previously founded or joined early-stage startups where
    autonomy and execution speed were critical
industries:
  - Artificial Intelligence
  - Software
