  BDO is a firm built on a foundation of positive
  relationships with our people and our clients. Each day, our
  professionals provide exceptional service, helping clients
  with advice and insight they can trust. In turn, we offer an
  award-winning environment that fosters a people-first
  culture with a high priority on your personal and
  professional growth.
  
  Your Opportunity
  
  As an experienced AI Engineer, you will design, build, and
  deploy production‑grade AI solutions that bridge
  experimental machine learning with scalable software
  engineering. In this replacement role, you will play a
  critical role in enabling enterprise‑ready AI capabilities
  with a strong focus on large language models (LLMs),
  retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG), and agentic workflows,
  operating within established governance frameworks.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Design, build, and deploy robust, scalable, production‑grade
    AI applications using frameworks such as LangChain,
    LlamaIndex, AutoGPT, and related LLM orchestration tools.
  - Develop, refine, and optimize complex prompt strategies;
    manage model context windows; and fine‑tune models where
    required to maximize performance, accuracy, and cost
    efficiency.
  - Integrate AI capabilities into existing enterprise
    environments through RESTful APIs, microservices, and
    cloud‑native architectures.
  - Build, maintain, and optimize vector databases (e.g.,
    Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate) and design efficient data
    ingestion and embedding pipelines to support
    retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) solutions.
  - Monitor AI systems in production and proactively address
    issues related to hallucinations, latency, reliability,
    scalability, and token‑cost optimization.
  - Collaborate closely with AI Architects, AI Studio Leads, ML
    Engineers, Data Scientists, Full‑Stack Developers, Service
    Line Labs, and Citizen Developers on firm‑wide initiatives
    and internal platforms.
  - Support AI system documentation, lifecycle management, and
    control processes in alignment with ISO/IEC 42001
    enterprise governance requirements.
  - Adhere to established AI risk management, data governance,
    and security policies, and assist with model inventories,
    traceability, and change‑management activities.
  - Participate in model testing and validation activities in
    accordance with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework,
    including mapping and measuring model risks.
  - Support the implementation of risk‑mitigation controls and
    ongoing monitoring, and follow governance processes that
    promote transparency, accountability, and responsible AI
    use.
  
  The expected range of compensation for this role is $77,000
  to $117,000 annually.
  
  How do we define success for your role?
  
  - You demonstrate BDO's core values through all aspect of your
    work: Integrity, Respect and Collaboration
  - You understand your client’s industry, challenges, and
    opportunities; clients describe you as positive,
    professional, and delivering high quality work
  - You identify, recommend, and are focused on effective
    service delivery to your clients
  - You share in an inclusive and engaging work environment that
    develops, retains & attracts talent
  - You actively participate in the adoption of digital tools
    and strategies to drive an innovative workplace
  - You grow your expertise through learning and professional
    development.
  
  Qualifications:
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science,
    Engineering, or a related field, with 3–5 years of
    professional experience in AI, machine learning, or
    applied software engineering.
  - Expert‑level proficiency in Python, with working familiarity
    in Java and/or TypeScript for enterprise application
    development.
  - Deep hands‑on experience with leading AI and LLM frameworks,
    including OpenAI APIs, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and
    LangGraph, along with a strong understanding of LLM‑based
    application design.
  - Proven experience designing and implementing
    retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) and agentic AI
    systems, supported by a solid grasp of scalable,
    production‑grade AI architectures.
  - Experience working with vector databases as well as SQL and
    NoSQL data stores, and hands‑on exposure to cloud
    platforms such as Azure AI / AI Foundry, AWS Bedrock, or
    Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
  - Practical experience with DevOps and MLOps practices,
    including Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines for
    machine learning workloads.
  - Familiarity with machine learning lifecycle and
    experiment‑tracking tools such as MLflow or Weights &
    Biases.
