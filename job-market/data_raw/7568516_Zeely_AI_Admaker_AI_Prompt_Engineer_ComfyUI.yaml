description: |
  Join us as an AI Engineer (ComfyUI) and become a driving
  force in scaling Zeely’s LLM initiatives and generative
  capabilities. We are looking for a specialist who will build
  a systematic approach to prompt creation and become a key
  player in the development of our AI platform. You will be
  responsible for creating scalable templates that work across
  hundreds of different products, as well as testing new
  generative models, identifying their use cases, and
  integrating them into Zeely’s pipelines.
  
  Zeely AI is a platform that uses artificial intelligence to
  generate viral UGC videos and ad banners, as well as launch
  effective ad campaigns on Facebook and Instagram, helping
  small businesses become visible and scale.
  
  We already have 1 million users in the US and are
  consistently growing more than 4x year-over-year. Today,
  Zeely is ranked among the Top-3 products in its category on
  the US market, and our team has grown to over 130
  specialists.
  
  We are part of the Google for Startups Alumni community and
  official partners of Meta and TikTok. In 2024, Zeely was
  recognized by Forbes Ukraine as one of the Top 25 fastest-
  growing startups.
  
  Your key responsibilities:
  
  - Design, build, and continuously optimize complex generative
    content pipelines across image, video, audio, and text
    formats.
  - Configure and fine-tune generative model parameters to
    achieve an optimal balance between quality, consistency,
    and performance.
  - Analyze, optimize, and improve existing workflows to
    increase stability, efficiency, and scalability in
    production environments.
  - Develop and maintain advanced ComfyUI pipelines, including
    working with custom nodes.
  - Proactively troubleshoot generation issues, quickly
    identifying root causes and implementing effective, long-
    term fixes.
  - Extend and evolve the capabilities of internal generative
    systems to support new use cases and product needs.
  - Collaborate closely with Product and Content teams to
    translate feature requirements into reliable, production-
    ready generative solutions.
  - Continuously research, benchmark, and test new models and
    tools, staying on top of market trends and emerging
    technologies, including: Flux, Nano Banana, OpenAI, Kling
    AI, Hailuo MiniMax, Veo 3, Runway, Pika Labs.
  
  What we’re looking for:
  
  - 2+ years of hands-on experience in AI / Generative Systems
    Engineering, with a strong focus on prompt engineering
    within multi-step, production-grade generative pipelines.
  - Practical experience working with generative models across
    multiple modalities, including: text-to-text, text-to-
    image, text-to-audio, video-to-video, and others.
  - Strong expertise in ComfyUI as a core working environment,
    including developing custom nodes.
  - Deep understanding of the generative AI ecosystem, including
    model architectures, strengths/limitations, inference
    behavior, and rapid evaluation of new releases.
  - Practical experience integrating open-source models and
    tools into existing pipelines, including evaluation,
    optimization, and maintenance.
  - Experience designing and configuring LLM-based agents or
    automation flows (prompt logic, chaining, orchestration,
    tool usage).
  - High adaptability and strong learning velocity — ability to
    quickly test, validate, and adopt new models, tools, and
    techniques in a fast-moving AI landscape.
  - Strong communication skills, with the ability to collaborate
    effectively with Product, Content, and Engineering teams,
    and clearly explain technical constraints and trade-offs.
  
  Nice to have:
  
  - Experience with an intuitive “vibe coding” approach to
    content generation.
  
  Why it’s exciting to work with us:
  
  - Work with cutting-edge technologies and contribute to
    building AI-powered tools.
  - Join a strong A-level team of experienced professionals who
    set a high bar and push each other to do better work.
  - Remote-first approach: work from anywhere, with access to
    our offices in Warsaw and Kyiv.
  - We take care of the essentials. Paid time off, sick leaves,
    and financial support with private entrepreneurship
    matters.
  - Regular performance reviews to ensure your growth is
    transparent and rewarded.
