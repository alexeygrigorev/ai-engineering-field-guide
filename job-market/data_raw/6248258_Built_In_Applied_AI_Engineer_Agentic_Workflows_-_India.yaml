  Hello, We’re Built In
  
  What We’re Up To
  
  Built In is the only recruitment and employer reputation
  platform that helps companies measure and shape their
  reputation in AI search — so they can be visible, trusted,
  and chosen by top talent.
  
  The HR tech space is filled with AI noise, but the real
  disruption is happening on the candidate side. By 2028, more
  candidates will use AI assistants like ChatGPT and
  Perplexity to discover and apply for jobs — fundamentally
  changing how talent and employers connect. Built In is the
  first to build for this new reality, giving companies the
  ability to understand and influence how they appear in AI-
  driven search.
  
  Our platform already reaches millions of tech professionals
  each month, and our 1,800+ customers — from startups to
  Fortune 100 companies — rely on us to tell authentic
  stories, showcase opportunities, and attract top talent.
  With our newest AI-powered tools, we’re evolving Built In
  into a data-rich, reputation-driven platform that’s shaping
  the future of hiring
  
  What You’ll Be a Part Of
  
  Built In is 14 years strong but operates with the energy and
  pace of a startup. We ship fast, learn constantly, and build
  with purpose. As an engineer here, you’ll have the chance to
  design and deliver products at the intersection of AI,
  reputation, and search — directly influencing how millions
  of professionals and thousands of companies connect.
  
  You’ll join a team that values curiosity, accountability,
  and being good humans first. Our engineering culture is
  rooted in collaboration, trust, and continuous improvement.
  
  If you want to build products that matter, shape how AI
  transforms the future of work, and make a visible impact
  inside a company that’s redefining its category — this is
  the opportunity for you
  
  We’re looking for an Applied AI Engineer
  
  We're seeking an experienced Applied AI Engineer to design
  and develop intelligent, agentic systems that take action on
  behalf of users. You’ll work at the intersection of AI
  automation and user experience—building conversational UIs
  and AI-driven workflows that solve real-world problems with
  minimal user input.
  
  This is an ideal role for someone who’s passionate about
  Large Language Models (LLMs), intelligent agents, and the
  future of user interaction. You’ll have the opportunity to
  shape how AI behaves autonomously within product ecosystems.
  
  How you’ll contribute
  
  - Architect and build agentic workflows that can interpret
    intent, plan tasks, and execute operations on behalf of
    users.
  - Develop and iterate on chat-based user interfaces for rich,
    dynamic interactions.
  - Leverage LLM platforms (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) and
    orchestration tools like LangChain, Semantic Kernel, or
    custom frameworks.
  - Work cross-functionally with backend engineers, product
    managers, and designers to integrate conversational
    features into the platform.
  - Design robust systems for evaluating agent performance, user
    feedback loops, and improving reliability.
  - Stay current with cutting-edge developments in LLM tools,
    RAG pipelines, memory/state handling, and prompt
    engineering.
  
  What you need
  
  - 4+ years in a Data Science, Machine Learning, or Applied AI
    role
  - Deep experience with Python, LLM APIs, and libraries like
    transformers, langchain, OpenAI, etc.
  - Experience building chatbots or conversational UIs, and
    strong understanding of natural language processing
  - Solid grasp of SQL, APIs, and structured/semi-structured
    data
  - Familiarity with vector databases, tool use orchestration,
    and agent memory design
  - Excellent collaboration and communication skills, especially
    in cross-functional teams
  - Bonus: experience in reinforcement learning, retrieval-
    augmented generation (RAG), or AI monitoring systems
  
  Why Work With Us
  
  - Help shape intelligent systems that act autonomously in
    real-world environments
  - Be part of a product-led, engineering-driven culture
  - Remote-first team with collaborative, flexible work
    structure
  - Opportunities for leadership and technical ownership in AI
    development
  
  What We Value
  
  We’re revolutionizing tech recruitment. So we question
  everything, because the best answers sit just to the right
  of a question mark. That’s our heritage as a disruptive
  company — as a company whose future depends on our capacity
  to innovate with a sense of drive, purpose and urgency. If
  you join Built In, you will work from this set of values:
  
  - Be Inclusive, Always. We’re committed to a culture where all
    people are respected, have a say and can be their whole
    selves. We will uplift and advocate for one another.
    Always.
  - Be Unreasonably Passionate. Our passion is borderline
    obsessive, and we’re ok with that. No one ever built
    anything great on a “meh.” We work with outsized passion
    to fulfill our mission.
  - Be Humble. You don’t have all the answers. Luckily, you
    don’t have to. Don’t worry about being right. Be humble
    instead.
  - Stay Curious. Curiosity is a springboard to the future. It
    can transform the wisp of an idea into a breakthrough. We
    ask “what if.” We work with wonder. It’s how we innovate.
  - Lead with Solutions. Question everything. But offer
    solutions as you do. Raise issues. But propose a few
    answers. For every hole you poke, offer a way to patch it
    up.
  - Own the Result. We have no time for blame or shame. When you
    stumble, own it, learn from it + get back to business.
  - Do More. Do more than your job description. Take initiative.
    Take charge. No job is beneath you, and no job is too big.
    Be a leader and do more — do whatever it takes.
  
  Be Inclusive, Always
  
  Research shows that women and other marginalized groups tend
  to apply to roles only when they check every point on a job
  description. We encourage you to apply if you meet the
  majority of qualifications and this role is aligned with
  your career trajectory.
  
  Built In is an equal employment opportunity employer.
  Qualified candidates are considered for employment without
  regard to race, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual
  orientation, national origin, age, military or veteran
  status, disability, or any other characteristic protected by
  applicable law.
  
  Built In is guided by principles of diversity, equity and
  inclusion (DEI). We are committed to this work over the
  long-term, but here’s some of what’s in place today:
  
  - We have three thriving ERG groups: BuiltOut, United We
    Parent and Women United in Tech.
  - We are proud to be led by a woman CEO and founder, and that
    more than half of our managers and employees identify as
    women
