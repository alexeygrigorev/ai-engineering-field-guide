  About Amperos Health
  
  Amperos Health is the leading provider of multi-modal RCM
  agents empowering healthcare clinics to collect more
  revenue, faster. Founded in 2023 and backed by Uncork, Neo,
  Nebular.vc and strategic angels from OpenAI, Stripe, and
  Twilio, we're on a mission to revamp the bridge between
  healthcare providers and payers. Our vision is to equip
  healthcare providers with an AI workforce that reduces
  administrative burden and accelerates revenue.
  
  About the role
  
  As an AI Engineer on our research team, you’ll work on our
  hardest research and AI infra problems. You’ll both help
  prototype new products and also work on turning prototypes
  into a high quality AI product. Hard problems include
  passing the healthcare billing Turing Test - would an
  insurance agent who is interacting with our AI or a
  healthcare biller who is reviewing the work of our AI think
  our AI is a human, and not an AI? More concretely, you will
  be working to improve our AI agent’s quality so it acts more
  human-like and collects more accurate and detailed results
  from insurance.
  
  What you’ll do
  
  - Main focus is on improving models, LLM orchestration, prompt
    optimizations, evaluation framework, and AI infra
  - Enable agent/workflow product engineers
  - Own and raise the bar on AI quality
  - Own ultimate vision of end to end AI orchestration of
    modules
  - Work on hardest research problems (ie. Anti-AI)
  - Mainly a mix of ML, data science, and applied LLM work.
    Heavy Python.
  
  Who we’re looking for
  
  - You like reading the latest LLM research papers
  - Deep experience in implementing and building AI agents
  - Eager to try out the latest releases (ie. o1, OpenAI voice
    mode, Claude Computer-Use) to see how it can be used in
    real-world healthcare billing applications
  - Worked with complex distributed systems with many async
    operations
  - Excited about pushing the boundaries of conversational AI
    technology
  - Can balance quick experimentation with systematic evaluation
  - Very high Python mastery
  
  Perks & Benefits
  
  - Competitive compensation
  - Paid lunch, dinner, coffee, snacks
  - In person culture at our cozy Flatiron district office in
    NYC with work from home on Fridays
  - Flexible hours and time off
  - AI subscriptions of your choice covered
  - Health, dental, vision insurance
  - 401(k) with matching contribution
  
  Our Values
  
  - Lead with Empathy - Great products and teams are built on
    empathy—whether for our customers, users, or team members.
    We take the time to walk in others' shoes, listen
    actively, and truly understand their challenges, needs,
    and perspectives.
  - Humbly Ambitious - We combine humility with ambition. No
    task is beneath us, and no challenge too big. Greatness
    comes from being willing to do whatever it takes, while
    having the courage to take bold risks and learn from
    failures.
  - Radical Agency - Own your domain. Drive initiatives with
    autonomy and accountability. Think deeply, communicate
    with the team, and maintain a bias for action.
