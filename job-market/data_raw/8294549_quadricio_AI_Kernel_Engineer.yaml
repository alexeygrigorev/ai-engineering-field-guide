description: |
  Quadric has created an innovative general purpose neural
  processing unit (GPNPU) architecture. Quadric's co-optimized
  software and hardware is targeted to run neural network (NN)
  inference workloads in a wide variety of edge and endpoint
  devices, ranging from battery operated smart-sensor systems
  to high-performance automotive or autonomous vehicle
  systems. Unlike other NPUs or neural network accelerators in
  the industry today that can only accelerate a portion of a
  machine learning graph, the Quadric GPNPU executes both NN
  graph code and conventional C++ DSP and control code. Role
  
  The AI Kernel Engineer in Quadric plays the key role to
  enable a large number of AI kernels/operators to run
  efficiently on the Quadric platform. The AI Kernel Engineer
  at Quadric will [1] develop a highly efficient Quadric
  kernel library for a variety of AI/LLM models; [2] analyze
  the performance and optimize the kernel for different
  hardware configurations; This senior technical role demands
  deep knowledge of hardware architecture, compiler toolchain
  and optimization techniques.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Develop AI/LLM kernels/operators on Quadric platform for
    efficient inference
  - Optimize the kernel performance for different hardware
    configurations and workloads
  - Profile and analyze kernel performance in terms of compute,
    data and parallelism; identify micro-architecture and
    software bottlenecks and provide optimization solutions
  - Optimize kernel C/C++ codes, maximize hardware utilization
  - Collaborate across related areas of the AI inference stack
    to support team and business priorities
  - Make Improvement to Quadric toolchain, compiler and runtime
  - Provide technical support and documents to customers and
    developer community
  
  Requirements
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s in Computer Science and/or Electric
    Engineering
  - 5+ years of experience in AI kernel development and
    optimization
  - experience with model and kernel inference performance
    profiling
  - experience with at least one of the following compute
    development: CUDA, DSP, NEON, Triton-lang
  - Proficiency in C/C++ and Python, experience with assembly
    language a plus
  - Demonstrate good capability in problem solving, debug and
    communication
  
  Benefits
  
  - Provide competitive salaries and meaningful equity
  - Provide a politics free community for the brilliant minds
    who want to make an immediate impact
  - Provide an opportunity for you to build long term career
    relationships
  - Foster an environment that allows for lasting personal
    relationships alongside professional one
  
  Founded in 2016 and based in downtown Burlingame,
  California, Quadric is building the world’s first
  supercomputer designed for the real-time needs of edge
  devices. Quadric aims to empower developers in every
  industry with superpowers to create tomorrow’s technology,
  today. The company was co-founded by technologists from MIT
  and Carnegie Mellon, who were previously the technical co-
  founders of the Bitcoin computing company 21.
  
  Quadric is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace and is
  an affirmative action employer. We are committed to equal
  employment opportunity regardless of race, religion, sex,
