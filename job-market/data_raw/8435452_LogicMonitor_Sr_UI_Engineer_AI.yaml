  LogicMonitor is redefining observability through AI-assisted
  operations (AIOps) and LLM-powered insights. We’re looking
  for a Senior UI Engineer to craft the next generation of
  intelligent, responsive, and data-driven interfaces,
  blending beautiful frontend experiences with powerful AI
  analytics handled by our backend systems. You’ll own how
  users interact with Edwin AI, AIOps, and GenAI copilots, by
  building chat-driven troubleshooting UIs, intelligent
  dashboards, and dynamic visualizations that surface deep
  operational intelligence.
  
  Here's a closer look at this key role:
  
  - Build and deliver AI-powered interfaces for Edwin AI and
    AIOps workflows: chat consoles, anomaly correlation
    explorers, and root-cause investigation views.
  - Ability to make use of latest Gen AI based UI offerings like
    Lovable to quickly prototype and productionise UI features
  - Enable real-time interactions between observability data
    (metrics, logs, traces) and the AI reasoning engine.
  - Develop with React and TypeScript, contributing to the
    migration of legacy ReScript code.
  - Style scalable, accessible interfaces using Tailwind CSS v4
    and Material UI.
  - Manage complex UI state via Zustand and Tanstack
    Query/Forms/Router for data orchestration.
  - Collaborate with data science and AI teams to visualize
    anomaly explanations, event correlations, and root-cause
    predictions.
  - Contribute to a design-driven frontend culture, emphasizing
    performance, accessibility, and usability.
  
  What You'll Need:
  
  - 4+ years in modern front-end engineering with React and
    TypeScript.
  - Proven ability to ship real-time UIs (chat, stream,
    dashboard, or analytics).
  - Ability to work with existing ReScript code, and willingness
    to migrate legacy components to TypeScript as part of
    ongoing modernization.
  - Familiarity with functional programming principles (ReScript
    is OCaml-based) and an interest in applying them to
    maintain or evolve existing modules.
  - Experience with CI/CD and DevOps tooling (Docker, Travis,
    Bash)
