  Company Description
  
  Assent is the leading solution for supply chain
  sustainability tailored for the world’s top-tier,
  sustainability-driven manufacturers. Hidden risks riddle
  supply chains, many of which weren't built with
  sustainability in mind. That's where we step in. With
  insights from experts, Assent is the tool manufacturers
  trust for comprehensive sustainability.
  
  We are proud to announce that Assent has crossed the US$100M
  ARR milestone, granting us Centaur Status. This
  accomplishment, reached just 8 years following our Series A,
  makes us the first and only Certified B Corporation in North
  America's SaaS sustainability industry to celebrate this
  milestone.
  
  Our journey from $5 million to US$100M ARR in just eight
  years has been marked by significant growth and
  achievements. With our $350 million US funding led by Vista
  Equity Partners, we're poised for even greater expansion and
  are on the lookout for outstanding team members to join our
  mission.
  
  Hybrid Work Model
  
  At Assent, we proudly embrace a remote-first work model,
  valuing the flexibility and autonomy it provides our team.
  We also acknowledge the intangible benefits of occasional
  in-person workdays. For team members situated within 50
  kms/31 miles of our five global offices in Ottawa, Eldoret,
  Penang, Columbus, Pune and Amsterdam, you can expect to come
  into the office at least one day a week. Similarly, those
  near our co-working spaces in Nairobi and Toronto are
  encouraged to work onsite once a month.
  
  Job Description
  
  We’re looking for a Creative Graphic Engineer who’s equal
  parts designer, innovator, and generative AI experimenter.
  If you're someone who loves pushing pixels, but also loves
  pushing boundaries, this is your role.
  
  This is not your typical graphic design job. We want someone
  who’s excited about reimagining visual storytelling using
  emerging AI tools, breaking out of the static eBook mold,
  and designing with data-backed intent. You'll be a key part
  of a fast-paced Marketing team that’s redefining how
  creative works in a modern B2B world.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Design digital assets that move the needle. Think high-
    impact visuals for eBooks, ads, social media, interactive
    web assets, landing pages, and more.
  - Use generative AI tools to augment, experiment, and scale
    creative output, always testing what works while upholding
    our brand integrity.
  - Translate strategy and messaging into scroll-stopping,
    performance-driven creative across digital and print.
  - Collaborate with writers, video, and campaign strategists to
    bring stories to life visually, while evolving our brand
    expression.
  - Work inside our creative tech stack with tools like Adobe
    CC, Adobe Firefly, Figma, Bynder, Seismic, Google Drive,
    and Monday.com to manage and deliver assets.
  - Bring ideas to planning sessions, test new formats, and
    track how your creative designs perform.
  - Help define and evolve visual standards, working across
    Product, Brand, and Demand Gen.
  
  Qualifications
  
  
  
  - 5+ years in graphic design, ideally in a B2B tech or SaaS
    environment (agency or in-house).
  - Ability to use generative AI (e.g., Adobe Firefly,
    Midjourney, Canva) as part of your design process.
  - A strong portfolio that showcases AI generation experience,
    versatility, experimentation, and an understanding of
    performance-driven design.
  - Mastery of design fundamentals, but a willingness to break
    the rules when the concept calls for it.
  - A curious mindset. You’re constantly exploring new tools,
    trends, and creative formats.
  - Comfort working in a fast-moving, cross-functional team that
    iterates quickly and values creative risk-taking.
  
  Bonus Points If You
  
  - Have motion/animation chops.
  - Have worked on brand evolutions or helped build a visual
    system from the ground up.
  - Bring a point of view on the future of AI and creativity.
