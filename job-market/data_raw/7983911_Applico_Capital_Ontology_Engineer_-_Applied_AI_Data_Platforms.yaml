  About Applico Capital
  
  Applico Capital is the leading venture capital firm focused
  on the $8 trillion B2B distribution industry. Through our
  learnings and understanding of the industry, we are building
  a tech startup, currently in stealth, to solve the
  industry's biggest problems as it comes to unlocking AI-
  enabled synergies.
  
  Our mandate is to leverage AI and modern technologies to
  reimagine the role of the traditional distributor and
  transform how the entire industry operates.
  
  We are looking for highly technical builders who thrive in
  entrepreneurial, scrappy, and collaborative environments.
  
  About the Role:
  
  We’re seeking an Ontology Engineer to help design and
  implement the semantic and structural backbone of this new
  data platform.
  
  You’ll model how products, suppliers, customers, and
  transactions interconnect — defining the schemas,
  relationships, and standards that make enterprise data
  interoperable, trustworthy, and ready for automation and AI.
  
  This role sits at the intersection of data architecture,
  knowledge representation, and applied AI. You’ll work
  closely with data engineers, architects, and AI teams to
  ensure every dataset aligns to a consistent, machine-
  understandable model that scales across multiple
  distributors and business systems.
  
  Key Responsibilities:
  
  - Design and maintain domain ontologies and semantic schemas
    that describe key business entities (e.g., product,
    supplier, customer, location, transaction)
  - Map and align internal data structures (ERP, CRM, PIM, CMS)
    to open data standards and taxonomies (e.g., schema.org,
    GS1, UNSPSC, ETIM)
  - Build and manage knowledge graph models and associated
    metadata structures
  - Define and enforce data modeling conventions, relationships,
    and validation rules (RDF, OWL, SHACL, JSON-LD)
  - Partner with data engineers and architects to embed semantic
    models into pipelines and APIs
  - Contribute to data governance, lineage, and interoperability
    practices across business domains
  - Collaborate with AI teams to support contextual retrieval,
    entity linking, and enrichment using LLMs and embeddings
  - Evaluate and adopt open-source tools for ontology
    management, graph storage, and reasoning (e.g., Protégé,
    Neo4j, Stardog, Weaviate, ArangoDB)
  - Help design developer-facing documentation and schemas to
    make complex data understandable and reusable
  
  Requirements
  
  - 5+ years of experience in ontology engineering, data
    modeling, or knowledge graph development
  - Proficiency with semantic web standards and technologies
    (RDF, OWL, SHACL, JSON-LD, SPARQL)
  - Experience designing or maintaining domain ontologies or
    taxonomies for real-world business applications
  - Familiarity with enterprise data integration (ERP, CRM, PIM,
    MDM, CMS) and how to model heterogeneous data
  - Knowledge of open data standards such as schema.org, GS1,
    ETIM, UNSPSC, or eCl@ss
  - Hands-on experience with graph databases (Neo4j, ArangoDB,
    Weaviate, Ontotext GraphDB, or similar)
  - Strong understanding of data lineage, governance, and
    interoperability principles
  - Experience collaborating with data engineers and AI/ML teams
  - Bonus: exposure to vector search, RAG pipelines, or LLM-
    based enrichment
  - Excellent communication skills — able to explain semantic
    concepts to non-technical audiences
  
  Why Join Us
  
  - Build the semantic foundation powering one of the most
    ambitious AI and data transformations in B2B commerce
  - Work alongside experts in data architecture, AI engineering,
    and automation
  - Help define how modern enterprises structure and share data
    in an open, extensible way
  - Operate with startup agility inside a large, stable, and
    forward-thinking business
  
  Preferred Stack
  
  - Standards: RDF, OWL, SHACL, JSON-LD, schema.org, GS1, ETIM
  - Databases: Neo4j, Weaviate, ArangoDB, Ontotext GraphDB,
    Stardog
  - Languages: Python, SPARQL, SQL
  - Tools: Protégé, dbt, Airbyte, Dagster/Prefect
  - AI & Enrichment (Optional): LangChain, LangGraph, DSPy,
    OpenAI APIs
industries:
  - Artificial Intelligence
  - Information Technology
