  Brainscape, the world's leading web & mobile EdTech study
  platform, is seeking an AI Prompt Engineer to help us ship
  and maintain high-quality generative AI features that help
  millions of learners create better flashcards.
  
  You will be working directly with Brainscape's Knowledge
  Manager to iterate on LLM prompts, analyze real user data,
  and ensure our AI output meets a high quality bar - both at
  launch and as models evolve. The immediate priority is
  migrating and testing our existing bulk flashcard creation
  prompts in an updated AI environment with newer GPT models.
  These prompts power three user-facing features: importing
  pasted or uploaded content into flashcards, summarizing
  documents into flashcards, and generating flashcards from a
  user-described topic. From there, the role expands into
  ongoing QA, regression testing, and prompt optimization
  across all of Brainscape's AI features.
  
  This is a part-time contract role (~5-10 hours/week, remote)
  through the end of 2026, with potential to extend or convert
  to a permanent position. Hourly rate is $40-$100 (based on
  experience and location).
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Migrate and test existing bulk flashcard creation prompts in
    an updated AI environment with newer GPT models - and plan
    future migrations as OpenAI retires older models
  - Run test suites and manually review AI outputs for quality
    and correctness (fine-tune prompts)
  - Analyze real user data to identify failure patterns and
    inform prompt improvements
  - Streamline testing and evaluation workflows to make QA
    faster and more repeatable
  - Monitor production quality post-launch and detect
    regressions as underlying models shift
  - Build and maintain model evaluation datasets from real user
    inputs across all AI features
  - Write new test cases for edge cases, multilingual content,
    and messy real-world inputs
  - Document prompt changes, test results, and lessons learned
  - Work with the Content Team to apply flashcard authoring
    quality standards
  
  Qualifications
  
  - 1+ years hands-on prompt engineering experience with LLMs /
    OpenAI API (systematic testing and iteration, not just
    casual ChatGPT usage)
  - Familiarity with Cursor IDE or similar AI-assisted
    development tools (our work is primarily Python - Cursor
    experience is more important than raw Python skill)
  - Some experience with Git version control and collaborating
    via shared repositories (we use GitLab)
  - A habit of documenting what you tried, what worked, and why
    - you don't need a formal QA background, but you naturally
    keep track of your process
  - Clear written communication skills
  - Proactive attitude; ability to work independently and manage
    your own time
  - BONUS: Experience building prompt evals, AI quality
    assurance, or using GPT to grade GPT outputs
  - BONUS: Experience with regression testing for AI systems or
    detecting model drift
  - BONUS: Background in education technology (EdTech) or
    content creation - especially microlearning, flashcards,
    or other concise Q&A formats
  - BONUS: A degree in Computer Science, Information Science, or
    a similar field
  
  To Apply
  
  Please apply above with a resume and anything you want us to
  know about why you think you'd be a good fit. If you are a
  top candidate, we will follow up with a short application
  form to help direct you to the right person for an
  interview.
