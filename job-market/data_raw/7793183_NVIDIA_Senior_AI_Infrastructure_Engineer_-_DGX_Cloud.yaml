  NVIDIA is looking for an outstanding, passionate, and
  talented Senior AI Infrastructure Engineer  to join our DGX
  Cloud group. This engineering role will design, build and
  maintain large scale production systems with high efficiency
  and availability using the combination of software and
  systems engineering practices. This role demands knowledge
  across different systems, networking, coding, database,
  capacity management, continuous delivery and deployment and
  open source cloud enabling technologies like Kubernetes and
  OpenStack. AI Infrastructure Engineer at NVIDIA ensures that
  our internal and external facing GPU cloud services run
  maximum reliability and uptime and at the same time making
  changes to the existing system through careful preparation
  and planning while managing capacity and performance.
  
  NVIDIA’s culture of diversity, intellectual curiosity,
  problem solving and openness is important to our success.
  
  
  Our organization brings together people with a wide variety
  of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We encourage
  them to collaborate, think big and take risks in a blame-
  free environment. We promote self-direction to work on
  meaningful projects, while we also strive to build an
  environment that provides the support and mentorship needed
  to learn and grow.
  
  What You’ll Be Doing:
  
  - Design, build, deploy, and run internal tooling for large
    scale AI training and Inferencing platform built on top of
    cloud infrastructure
  - Conduct in-depth performance characterization and analysis
    on large multi-GPU and multi-node clusters.
  - Engage in and improve the whole lifecycle of services—from
    inception and design through deployment, operation and
    refinement.
  - Support services before they go live through activities such
    as system design consulting, developing software tools,
    platforms and frameworks, capacity management and launch
    reviews.
  - Maintain services once they are live by measuring and
    monitoring availability, latency and overall system
    health.
  - Scale systems sustainably through mechanisms like
    automation, and evolve systems by pushing for changes that
    improve reliability and velocity
  - Practice sustainable incident response and blameless
    postmortems
  - Be part of an on call rotation to support production systems
  
  What We Need To See:
  
  - BS degree in Computer Science or a related technical field
    involving coding (e.g., physics or mathematics), or
    equivalent experience.
  - 5+ years of experience.
  - A track record showing a good balance between initiating
    your own projects, convincing others to collaborate with
    you and collaborating well on projects initiated by
    others.
  - Experience with infrastructure automation and distributed
    systems design developing tools for running large scale
    private or public cloud systems in production.
  - Experience in one or more of the following: Python, Go,
    C/C++, Java
  - In depth knowledge in one or more of Linux, Networking,
    Storage, and Containers Technologies
  - Experience with Public Cloud and Infrastructure as a code
    (IAAC) and Terraform
  - Distributed system experience
  
  Ways to stand out from the crowd:
  
  - Interest in crafting, analyzing and fixing large-scale
    distributed systems.
  - Systematic problem-solving approach, coupled with strong
    communication skills and a sense of ownership and drive.
  - Ability to debug and optimize code and automate routine
    tasks.
  - Experience in using or running large private and public
    cloud systems based on Kubernetes or Slurm.
