  At Libra, we're transforming how legal professionals work.
  Our AI platform combines deep legal reasoning with cutting-
  edge generative technology to help lawyers research, draft,
  and deliver legal work faster and smarter.
  
  In just over a year, we became one of Europe's fastest-
  growing legal AI companies—and in late 2025, we joined
  Wolters Kluwer, the global leader in legal information
  services. Together, we're combining Libra's AI capabilities
  with Wolters Kluwer's authoritative legal content to build
  the most powerful AI workspace for lawyers in Europe. We've
  already launched in the Netherlands and Poland, and are
  expanding across new markets with full localization and deep
  local content integrations.
  
  This is a unique opportunity to shape the next generation of
  legal AI products—now at true European scale.
  
  Role Overview
  
  As a DevOps Engineer (m/w/d) at Libra, you’ll play a central
  role in building, automating, and scaling the infrastructure
  behind products trusted by top law firms and legal teams
  across Europe. You’ll design and maintain robust, secure
  systems that ensure our platform is fast, stable, and
  compliant — while empowering our engineering teams to ship
  quickly and confidently.
  
  This is a high-impact role for engineers who thrive at the
  intersection of reliability, security, and automation.
  You’ll work hybrid with our team at the Merantix AI Campus
  in Berlin, collaborating closely with our AI, Product, and
  Security teams to ensure that Libra’s infrastructure scales
  as fast as our customer base.
  
  What You'll Do:
  
  - Design, implement, and maintain Libra’s cloud infrastructure
    on Open Telekom Cloud (OTC), ensuring security,
    reliability, and scalability.
  - Automate infrastructure setup and management using Ansible
    and Terraform.
  - Build and optimize CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, enabling
    fast, stable deployments.
  - Containerize applications with Docker and manage
    orchestration across environments.
  - Set up and maintain observability systems using Grafana and
    Prometheus to monitor system health and performance.
  - Collaborate with developers to ensure seamless integration
    of infrastructure and application layers.
  - Drive continuous improvement in performance, resilience, and
    security.
  - Ensure compliance with the highest standards of data
    protection and reliability for enterprise-grade customers.
  
  What You Bring:
  
  - Strong experience managing cloud infrastructure on at least
    one major provider (e.g., Open Telekom Cloud, AWS, Azure,
    or GCP).
  - Deep knowledge of Docker, Ansible, and Terraform for
    automation and orchestration.
  - Experience with Jenkins or similar CI/CD tools.
  - Proficiency in setting up monitoring and observability
    stacks (Grafana, Prometheus).
  - Strong understanding of security best practices and
    compliance requirements.
  - Excellent communication skills in English; German is a plus.
  - Entrepreneurial mindset with a strong sense of urgency;
    self-starter who works independently while aligning to
    team goals.
  
  What We Offer:
  
  - Permanent employment from day one.
  - Remote work & flexibility: Work remotely up to 3 days per
    week (home office) (= 8 days a month in the office) with
    flexible working hours.
  - Work abroad flexibly: Work from anywhere within the EU for
    up to 20 days within a twelve-month period.
  - Rest & time off: 26 vacation days.
  - Show your commitment: 1 additional day off per year for your
    volunteer work (Volunteer Day).
  - Support for development: E-learning via LinkedIn, online
    language training with goFluent, and other training and
    development opportunities.
  
  Join us, at Wolters Kluwer, and be part of a global
  technology company that makes a difference every day. Be the
  difference. If making a difference matters to you, then you
  matter to us.

  Our Interview Practices
  
  To maintain a fair and genuine hiring process, we kindly ask
  that all candidates participate in interviews without the
  assistance of AI tools or external prompts. Our interview
  process is designed to assess your individual skills,
  experiences, and communication style. We value authenticity
  and want to ensure we’re getting to know you—not a digital
  assistant. To help maintain this integrity, we ask to remove
  virtual backgrounds and include in-person interviews in our
  hiring process. Please note that use of AI-generated
  responses or third-party support during interviews will be
  grounds for disqualification from the recruitment process.
  
  Applicants may be required to appear onsite at a Wolters
  Kluwer office as part of the recruitment process.
