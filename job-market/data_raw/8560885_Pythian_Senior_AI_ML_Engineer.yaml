  Why Pythian:
  
  At Pythian, we are experts in strategic database and
  analytics services, driving digital transformation and
  operational excellence. Pythian, a multinational company,
  was founded in 1997 and started by ensuring the reliability
  and performance of mission-critical databases. We quickly
  earned a reputation for solving tough data challenges. We
  were there when the industry moved from on-premises to cloud
  environments, and as enterprises sought more from their
  data, we expanded our competencies to include advanced
  analytics.
  
  Today, we empower organizations to embrace transformation
  and leverage advanced technologies, including AI, to stay
  competitive. We deliver innovative solutions that meet each
  client’s data goals and have built strong partnerships with
  Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and Snowflake.

  and cloud and our ability to keep on top of the latest
  bleeding edge technologies make us the perfect partner to
  help mid and large-sized businesses transform to stay ahead
  in today’s rapidly changing digital economy.
  
  Why you:
  
  As a Senior AI / ML Engineer, you will be a key contributor
  in the design, development, and deployment of end-to-end
  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning solutions. Your
  primary focus will be on building robust, scalable, and
  reliable AI/ML pipelines, with a significant emphasis on
  integrating and optimizing advanced models, including Large
  Language Models (LLMs), Generative AI, and other cutting-
  edge AI technologies, into client and internal products.
  Your role requires a deep understanding of both ML
  engineering best practices and the broader AI ecosystem,
  collaborating closely with data scientists, product
  managers, and software engineering teams.
