  About Encord
  
  At Encord, we're building the AI infrastructure of the
  future. One of the biggest challenges AI companies face
  today is data quality. The success of any AI application
  relies heavily on the quality of its training data, yet for
  most teams, this crucial step is both the most costly and
  time-consuming. We’re here to change that.
  
  As former computer scientists, physicists, and quants, we’ve
  experienced firsthand how a lack of tools to prepare quality
  training data impedes progress in building AI. We believe AI
  is at a stage similar to the early days of computing or the
  internet—where the potential is clear, but the surrounding
  tools and processes are still catching up. That's why we
  started Encord.
  
  We are a talented and ambitious team of 100+, working at the
  cutting edge of computer vision and deep learning. Backed by
  $30M in Series B funding from top investors like CRV and Y
  Combinator, we’re one of the fastest-growing companies in
  our space. We have big plans ahead and are looking to expand
  our Engineering team to help us in building a better product
  for our customers.
  
  What you’ll work on / the team you’ll join
  
  We’re building tools for the full Physical AI data stack -
  from data acquisition, through ingestion and curation at
  scale to 3D rendering, annotation and verification. You’ll
  solve problems of large scale efficient data transfer and
  storage, complex domain modelling, applying the latest
  machine learning models and squeezing performance out of web
  browsers.
  
  Who we are looking for
  
  You feel at home with challenging front-end work, such as
  rendering complex 3D scenes with thousands of objects while
  maintaining smooth frame rates. You’ll work with the biggest
  names in robotics and autonomous vehicles. You’ll understand
  the details of with visual, spatial and sensor data, making
  sense of reality.
  
  You will operate with high degrees of autonomy and be
  expected to craft at speed. We need performant, reliable and
  maintainable solutions to challenging problems - both
  technical and product.
  
  You'll join us at a crucial stage of accelerated development
  for the company, product and team. As part of a small,
  highly collaborative group, you'll be a key driver of
  progress on a core part of our product.
  
  What to expect
  
  - High performing team: You'll join the small team that has
    built a product that our customers love. Members of the
    team are veterans of both established companies and
    successful startups. While the team is more than a sum of
    its parts, every member is impressive in their own right
  
  - Impact: Your work will have direct and tangible impact for
    customers and in turn noticeably affect the trajectory of
    the company.
  
  - End-to-end ownership: You will be entrusted with end-to-end
    ownership of your projects. From product, design and
    architectural decisions, all the way to deployment,
    monitoring and measuring impact on users. You will work
    across the stack, covering everything from deployment to
    styling. We expect each other to take initiative, be
    proactive in problem-solving, and continuously seek
    improvements.
  
  - Autonomy and collaboration: You will often work autonomously
    to take charge of your projects, make decisions, and drive
    your work forward. But as a lean and high trust team, we
    remain quick to collaborate and support each other with
    challenging problems together.
  
  - Scale and simplicity: You will tackle complex domains and
    immense scale with simple solutions. You'll leverage your
    expertise to solve challenging problems in simple ways.
  
  About You
  
  - Are experienced: You have seen a lot and built a lot. You
    have personally developed and maintained multiple systems
    from scratch and you know what trade offs are involved in
    building reliable, performant software at speed.
  
  - Seek high impact: You want your work to have a tangible
    outcome for people. You're not satisfied when building
    products that do not see the light of day or move a number
    by a tenth of a percent.
  
  - Are a builder: You enjoy all aspects of building not only
    software but a complete product and are comfortable moving
    across the stack when necessary. You enjoy problem solving
    and thinking from first principles. You’re ready to pick
    up new skills and build quickly.
  
  - Are comfortable with uncertainty: You're happy to tackle
    problems without a predefined clear definition or obvious
    solution, and are excited to have autonomy to make
    decisions as you go.
  
  - Are a team player: You understand that being a member of a
    high-performing team requires two things. You contribute
    your best work. You also help others contribute their
    best. You enjoy lending a helping hand when needed and
    levelling up those around you.

  you to have experience in all these technologies. As long as

  - Competitive salary, commission and equity in a hyper growth
    business.
  
  - Strong in-person culture: most of our team is in the office
    3+ days a week.
  
  - Room to grow into anything you choose to — a year ago we
    were 50 people, now we're 100+. We'll be growing insanely
    fast over the next 24 months and you'll have all the
    opportunities for growth as you can handle.
