  Who You Are
  
  You are a hands-on technologist who loves turning real-world
  business problems into clean, scalable AI and automation
  solutions. You are as comfortable meeting with department
  heads and frontline managers to understand their pain points
  as you are designing LLM-based agents, building workflows,
  and wiring APIs together behind the scenes. You communicate
  clearly with both technical and non-technical stakeholders,
  ask thoughtful questions, and translate vague ideas into
  concrete requirements, prototypes, and production-ready
  solutions. You enjoy collaborating in a team environment
  where the CIO sets the strategy, a project manager manages
  intake and prioritization, and you own the technical
  delivery that brings AI and automation to life across the
  business.
  
  About The Role
  
  As the AI & Automation Technical Lead at Myriad360, you will
  be the primary technical owner and builder of AI- and
  automation-powered solutions across the company, reporting
  directly to the CIO of a mid-sized IT value-added reseller.
  You will partner closely with leaders and department heads
  to identify high-impact opportunities, define requirements,
  and deliver solutions that reduce friction, improve quality,
  and accelerate operations across functions.
  
  You will work within our Microsoft 365–centric environment
  and leverage our existing platforms, including Microsoft
  Power Platform, ChatGPT Enterprise (supported by a Zero Data
  Retention API agreement with OpenAI), and tools such as
  Stack AI and Zapier. You will design and implement AI-
  powered workflows, agentic workflows, AI agents, and
  retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, integrate
  them with our core systems, and coordinate with trusted
  third-party partners to execute against a shared backlog of
  AI and automation requests.
  
  Must be based in the United States.  Travel up to 10% may be
  required.
  
  Other responsibilities include:
  
  - Partner with business leaders and department heads to map
    current processes, elicit requirements, and identify high-
    value AI and automation opportunities across sales,
    operations, finance, services, and IT
  - Design, prototype, and implement AI-powered workflows and
    agentic solutions, including task- and process-specific
    agents, copilots, and multi-step orchestrations
  - Build and optimize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
    pipelines that securely leverage internal data, including
    data preparation, vectorization, retrieval design, and
    relevance tuning
  - Develop and maintain integrations across systems using APIs
    (for example Microsoft Graph API, OpenAI API, and other
    SaaS APIs) and automation platforms (such as Power
    Automate, Zapier, n8n, and Make)
  - Implement observability, monitoring, evaluation, and
    guardrails for AI agents and workflows, including logging,
    metrics, and feedback loops that support continuous
    improvement
  - Collaborate with third-party delivery partners and vendors
    to divide and conquer the AI/automation backlog, provide
    technical direction, and review solution designs for
    quality, security, and maintainability
  - Lead and support user acceptance testing (UAT), gather
    feedback, refine solutions, and support rollout and
    adoption through documentation and light training
  - Work closely with the CIO and project manager to provide
    technical input into sizing, sequencing, and
    prioritization of automation and AI work
  - Complete ongoing security awareness training and comply with
    company policies to the requirements section
  - Identify and escalate security risks to the appropriate
    Executive Leadership Team member and actively contribute
    to remediation efforts
  - Other duties as assigned
  
  Desired skills and experience:
  
  - 5+ years of hands-on experience in roles such as solutions
    engineer, automation engineer, AI engineer, or similar,
    ideally within a B2B, IT services, VAR, or MSP environment
  - Proven experience designing, building, and deploying AI-
    powered solutions using modern LLMs (such as ChatGPT,
    Claude, Gemini or similar), including prompt design, tool
    or agent definition, and evaluation
  - Experience with enterprise AI and agent platforms or
    frameworks such as Stack AI, Azure AI Foundry, Crew AI,
    OpenAI AgentKit, Dify, Dust, Langflow, LlamaIndex, Fetch
    AI or comparable tools
  - Strong experience working with APIs and integrations,
    including Microsoft Graph API, OpenAI API, RESTful APIs,
    webhooks, authentication/authorization (for example OAuth
    and API keys), and JSON-based data transformations
  - Hands-on experience with automation and orchestration tools
    such as Power Automate, Zapier, n8n, or Make to build end-
    to-end workflows
  - Familiarity with vector databases and retrieval frameworks
    (e.g., Weaviate, Pinecone, Qdrant, or Chroma) and how they
    support scalable, performant RAG solutions
  - Experience designing for observability, safety, and
    governance of AI systems, including logging, monitoring,
    evaluation, and guardrails for enterprise use
  - Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with a
    demonstrated ability to facilitate working sessions,
    elicit requirements, translate business needs into
    technical designs, and run effective user acceptance
    testing
  - Comfort working in a Microsoft 365–centric environment;
    experience with the broader Microsoft Power Platform
    (Power Apps, Power BI) is a plus
  - A pragmatic, impact-focused mindset; you prioritize
    solutions that are secure, maintainable, and deliver
    measurable business outcomes over experimentation for its
    own sake
