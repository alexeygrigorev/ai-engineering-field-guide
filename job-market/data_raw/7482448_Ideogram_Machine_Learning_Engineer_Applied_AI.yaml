  About Ideogram
  
  Ideogram’s mission is to make world-class design accessible
  to everyone, multiplying human creativity. We build
  proprietary generative media models and AI native creative
  workflows, tackling unsolved challenges in graphic design.
  Our team includes builders with a track record of technology
  breakthroughs including early research in Diffusion Models,
  Google’s Imagen, and Imagen Video. We care about design,
  taste, and craft as much as research and engineering –
  shipping experiences that creatives actually love.
  
  We’ve raised nearly $100M, led by Andreessen Horowitz and
  Index Ventures. Headquartered in Toronto with a growing team
  in NYC, we're scaling fast, aiming to triple over the next
  year. We're a flat team with a culture of high ownership,
  collaboration, and mentorship.

  The Opportunity
  
  We’re hiring our first Machine Learning Engineer to lead
  applied AI initiatives. You’ll bridge research and product,
  turning frontier generative models into production features
  across our first-party app and API. You’ll experiment
  quickly, build rigorous evaluations and datasets, and
  partner with research, engineering, infra, and product to
  ship reliable and scalable ML systems. You’ll fine-tune and
  deploy models for creative use cases (text-to-image, image-
  to-text, image enhancement and editing, multimodal), set
  clear success metrics (quality, latency, cost), and
  contribute to safety, monitoring, and reliability of our
  systems. You’ll lead 0 to 1 projects that shape Applied AI
  practices at Ideogram, while delivering features that create
  delight and real value for our users.
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - 3+ years of building and shipping ML products.
  - You write backend code in Python/ PyTorch/ Jax.
  - You design benchmarks and evaluation metrics, run error
    analyses, and debug numerical stability across data,
    training, and inference.
  - You’ve taken ML features from idea to evaluation to
    production with measurable gains (quality, latency, or
    cost).
  - You collaborate with the product team to define success
    criteria and iterate quickly and pragmatically.
  - You’re comfortable curating, labeling, and cleaning
    datasets, and designing evaluation corpora and failure-
    mode analyses.
  - You’re familiar with modern deep learning such as
    transformers, diffusion, and encoders.
  - You bring ownership, urgency, curiosity, and learn fast in a
    startup setting.
  
  Our Culture
  
  We’re a team of exceptionally talented, curious builders who
  love solving tough problems and turning bold ideas into
  reality. We move fast, collaborate deeply, and operate
  without unnecessary hierarchy, because we believe the best
  ideas can come from anyone.
  
  Everyone at Ideogram rolls up their sleeves to make our
  products and our customers successful. We thrive on
  curiosity, creativity, and shared ownership. We believe that
  small, dedicated teams working together with trust and
  purpose can move faster, think bigger, and create amazing
  things.
  
  Ideogram is committed to welcoming everyone — regardless of
  gender identity, orientation, or expression. Our mission is
  to create belonging and remove barriers so everyone can
  create boldly.
  
  What We Offer
  
  💸Competitive compensation and equity designed to recognize
  the value and impact of your contributions to Ideogram’s
  success. 🌴 4 weeks of vacation to recharge and explore. 🩺
  Comprehensive health, vision, and dental coverage starting
  on day one. 💰 RRSP/401(k) with employer match up to 4% to
  invest in your future from the moment you join. 💻 Top-of-
  the-line tools and tech to fuel your creativity and
  productivity. 📍 Toronto HQ perks: Steps from Union Station
  and the PATH, with daily in-office lunches and dinners. 🔍
  Autonomy to explore and experiment — whether you’re testing
  new ideas, running large-scale experiments, or diving into
  research, you’ll have access to compute/resources you need
  when there’s a clear business or creative use case. We
  encourage curiosity and bold thinking. 🌱 A culture of
  learning and growth, where curiosity is encouraged and
  mentorship is part of the journey.
