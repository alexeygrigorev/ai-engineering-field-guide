  Job Description:
  
  AI Lead Engineer
  
  Role Overview
  
  
  We are seeking a Lead Generative AI Engineer with strong
  foundations in deep learning, transformer architecture, and
  practical experience building GenAI applications beyond
  basic RAG systems. The ideal candidate has hands-on
  experience/technical familiarity with LLM fine-tuning,
  multimodal models, retrieval systems, agentic frameworks,
  retrieval architectures, and production-grade ML deployment.
  
  
  This role will partner with engineering, data science, and
  CX teams to build intelligent agents, multimodal
  experiences, personalization systems, and knowledge-grounded
  AI solutions that power the future of customer engagement
  for global brands.
  
  Key ResponsibilitiesGenerative AI, Multimodal Systems &
  Agentic Frameworks
  
  - Build conversational and non-conversational, multimodal, and
    agentic AI applications using LLMs and frameworks such as
    LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, or similar.
  - Design AI workflows incorporating reasoning, planning, tool-
    use, memory, grounding, and external system integrations.
  - Develop Knowledge Graph (KG)-assisted AI systems, including
    entity extraction, linking, and KG-augmented retrieval.
  - Ensure safety, consistency, and hallucination-control
    through structured evaluation and guardrails.
  
  Deployment, APIs & Cloud Engineering
  
  - Transform models into scalable APIs and microservices using
    Python, FastAPI/Flask, Docker.
  - Deploy and monitor ML/AI systems in AWS/Azure/GCP,
    optimizing for cost, latency, and reliability.
  - Collaborate with MLOps teams on CI/CD pipelines, model
    versioning, monitoring, and automated evaluation.
  - Work with big data technologies including Apache Spark,
    Hadoop, and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB.
  
  Model Development & Applied AI Engineering
  
  - Build and optimize transformer-based and multimodal models
    using deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch,
    TensorFlow).
  - Implement fine-tuning, alignment (RLHF/RLAIF), LoRA/QLoRA,
    pruning, and model evaluation pipelines.
  - Develop information retrieval systems, including hybrid
    dense–sparse retrieval, ranking, knowledge graphs, and
    relevance optimization.
  - Build predictive models and ML pipelines from scratch,
    including data preparation, feature engineering, and model
    selection.
  
  Collaboration, Documentation & Mentorship
  
  - Work cross-functionally with CX, engineering, and product
    stakeholders to translate business needs into AI
    solutions.
  - Document models, experiments, evaluation frameworks, and
    deployment processes.
  - Mentor junior engineers and contribute to internal best
    practices, reusable components, and R&D initiatives.
  
  Required Technical Skills
  
  - Programming: Python (advanced), SQL; robust experience with
    API development and data engineering,
  - Backend Frameworks: Flask, FASTAPI, Django
  - Machine Learning: Predictive modelling, deep learning,
    optimization, embeddings, vector search, model evaluation.
  - Generative AI: LLMs, RAG, multimodal architectures, agents,
    prompt engineering, grounding, knowledge graphs.
  - Cloud Platforms: AWS, Azure, or GCP with hands-on experience
    deploying and scaling AI systems.
  - Data Technologies: Apache Spark, Hadoop, MongoDB; strong
    understanding of data pipelines and large-scale
    processing.
  - Math Foundations: Linear algebra, probability, statistics.
  
  Experience Requirements
  
  - Minimum 5-6 years of hands-on software development
    experience including building and deploying machine
    learning models into production.
  - 2+ years of experience working with deep learning, GenAI, or
    transformer-based architectures.
  - Demonstrated experience building GenAI applications beyond
    simple RAG (e.g., agents, multimodal, custom LLM fine-
    tuning).
  - Experience integrating AI systems in enterprise-grade
    environments.
