  Core Responsibilities
  
  - Design and develop AI-powered applications, integrating
    machine learning and generative models into enterprise-
    grade software products and internal tools. Own the full
    software development lifecycle (SDLC), including unit,
    integration, and end-to-end testing.
  - Frontend: Develop modern, intuitive interfaces for AI
    applications (React/Next.js, TypeScript, or equivalent)
    with a strong focus on usability, accessibility, and AI
    explainability.
  - Backend: Implement scalable and secure back-end services
    (FastAPI, Flask, or Node.js) to expose AI capabilities
    (LLMs, RAG pipelines, AI agents) through standardized
    APIs.
  - Translate data science prototypes and GenAI models (LLMs,
    diffusion models, transformers) into scalable applications
    or services with intuitive user interfaces and reliable
    back-end infrastructure.
  - Collaborate with insight leaders and business stakeholders
    on requirements gathering, project documentation, and
    development planning.
  - Partners with MLOps and GenAIOps teams to deploy, monitor,
    and continuously improve AI applications within
    standardized CI/CD pipelines.
  - Design and implement integrations using REST, GraphQL, and
    gRPC; work with cloud-based AI APIs (Azure, AWS, GCP) and
    enterprise data sources.
  - Integrate cloud-native AI services (AWS Bedrock, Azure
    OpenAI) and open-source frameworks (LangChain, LangGraph)
    into enterprise environments.
  - Monitor application performance and user adoption, iterating
    on models and workflows to enhance usability and business
    impact.
  - Optimize application performance, infrastructure efficiency,
    and LLM utilization.
  - Document architectures, APIs, and deployment processes to
    ensure transparency, reusability, and maintainability.
  
  Experience Requirements
  
  - Education: Master’s degree (or equivalent experience) in
    Computer Science, Software Engineering, Artificial
    Intelligence, or related STEM field.
  - Experience: 1–3 years of hands-on experience developing and
    deploying AI-powered or data-driven applications in
    production environments.
  - Strong proficiency in Python, with working knowledge of
