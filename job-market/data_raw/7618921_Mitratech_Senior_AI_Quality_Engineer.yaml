  Job Overview
  
  We are seeking a highly skilled Senior QA Engineer
  specializing in AI and Machine Learning to join our growing
  team. The ideal candidate will play a pivotal role in
  ensuring the quality, reliability, and performance of our
  AI-driven products and platforms. This position requires a
  strong foundation in software testing, automation, and QA
  strategy, combined with an understanding of machine learning
  workflows such as RAG pipelines, inference APIs, and
  generative AI applications. The successful candidate will
  collaborate closely with ML engineers, data scientists, and
  developers to design and execute comprehensive test plans
  that validate model behavior, system integrations, and end-
  to-end user experiences.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Design and execute manual and automated test cases for
    backend APIs, frontend interfaces, and end-to-end AI
    workflows.
  - Conduct exploratory testing of new generative AI features
    and user interactions.
  - Develop and maintain automated test frameworks for UI and
    API.
  - Build automation scripts for AI/ML pipelines using pytest,
    unittest, or custom frameworks.
  - Create comprehensive test plans, manage defects, and report
    results using Jira, or similar tools.
  - Validate RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines,
    including embedding accuracy, retrieval quality, and model
    response evaluation.
  - Test AI agents and orchestration flows, ensuring correctness
    in multi-step reasoning and tool invocations.
  - Perform performance and scalability testing for ML inference
    endpoints (SageMaker, Bedrock, custom APIs), monitoring
    latency and throughput.
  - Conduct integration testing across data ingestion,
    preprocessing, inference, and output pipelines.
  - Validate UI/UX and Gen AI interaction flows, ensuring a
    consistent and intuitive user experience across devices
    and browsers.
  - Automate end-to-end test scenarios, including document
    upload, retrieval, summarization, and inference workflows.
  - Integrate and maintain automated test suites within CI/CD
    pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).
  - Collaborate closely with ML engineers, data scientists, and
    developers to reproduce issues, validate fixes, and ensure
    model reliability.
  - Ensure security, compliance, and data privacy standards are
    upheld for sensitive datasets during testing.
  
  Skills & Experience
  
  - Strong experience in manual testing of backend APIs,
    frontend apps, and full-stack systems.
  - Hands-on with test automation tools: Selenium, Playwright,
    Cypress, Postman, REST-assured, or Python-based
    frameworks.
  - Proficient in test case design, bug reporting, and defect
    tracking (Jira, Trello, or equivalents).
  - Familiarity with AI/ML workflows — especially LLM-based
    applications, RAG pipelines, embeddings, and model
    inference.
  - Experience with performance testing tools or frameworks;
    understanding of latency, throughput, and scaling metrics.
  - Knowledge of CI/CD automation and integrating tests into
    build pipelines.
  - Understanding of API testing principles: CRUD operations,
    authentication, edge cases, and error handling.
  - Familiar with UI/UX validation and cross-browser
    compatibility testing.
  - Strong analytical and communication skills — able to
    describe AI-related issues clearly and reproducibly.
  - Awareness of security and compliance practices for testing
    sensitive or proprietary data.
  
  Education:
  
  - A Master’s degree in Machine Learning, Computer Science with
    a preference for specialization in the NLP domain.
  
  We are an equal-opportunity employer that values diversity
  at all levels. All qualified applicants will receive
  consideration for employment without regard to race, color,
  religion, gender, national origin, age, sexual orientation,
  gender identity, disability, or veteran status.
