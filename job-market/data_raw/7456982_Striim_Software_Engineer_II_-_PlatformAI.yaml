description: |
  Striim, (pronounced “stream” with two i’s for integration
  and intelligence), is a unified data integration and
  streaming platform that connects clouds, data, and
  applications with unprecedented speed and simplicity to
  deliver the right data at the right time. Striim is used by
  enterprise companies to monitor events across any
  environment, build applications that drive digital
  transformation, and leverage true real-time analytics to
  provide a superior experience to their customers. At our
  company, we believe and expect all of our employees to
  operate as one with unlimited potential and dignity.
  
  We are hiring a Software Engineer II to join our AI /
  Platform Engineering team in Chennai or Bengaluru. This role
  will help design and build the next generation of Striim’s
  intelligent, cloud-native streaming data integration
  platform — now enhanced with AI-driven capabilities that
  enable automation, intelligent data enrichment, and
  contextual insights in real time.
  
  You’ll work on distributed systems, data streaming, and
  emerging AI technologies such as Model Context Protocol
  (MCP) and agentic AI frameworks, ensuring that our platform
  remains performant, scalable, and secure. This is a hands-on
  individual contributor role within a highly collaborative
  engineering organization.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Design, implement, and maintain core components of Striim’s
    AI / Platform infrastructure for scalable, real-time data
    processing.
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams — including Data
    Science, Cloud Infrastructure, and Product — to embed AI
    capabilities across the platform.
  - Develop and optimize microservices for performance,
    reliability, and cost efficiency in multi-cloud
    environments (AWS, Azure, GCP).
  - Contribute to platform observability, automation, and
    intelligent orchestration frameworks.
  - Write clean, efficient, and testable code following modern
    best practices (CI/CD, automated testing, code reviews).
  - Participate in technical design discussions and influence
    architectural decisions.
  - Troubleshoot and resolve production issues quickly and
    effectively.
  - Stay current with emerging technologies in AI, distributed
    systems, and cloud computing to continuously evolve our
    platform.
  
  Requirements
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science,
    Engineering, or a related field.
  - 3–5 years of professional software development experience.
  - Strong programming skills in Java and Python.
  - Hands-on experience with distributed systems and data
    streaming frameworks (Kafka, Flink, Spark Streaming) or
    message queues.
  - Familiarity with Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud-native
    architectures across AWS, Azure, or GCP.
  - Experience building REST APIs, microservices, and event-
    driven systems.
  - Working knowledge of CI/CD pipelines and version control
    tools (Git, Jenkins, etc.).
  - Exposure to AI/ML pipelines, agentic AI frameworks, or LLM-
    based automation is a plus.
  - Experience with real-time analytics, ETL pipelines, or data
    integration platforms preferred.
  - Familiarity with observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana,
    OpenTelemetry).
  - Experience contributing to high-performance SaaS or PaaS
    products.
  - Strong analytical and problem-solving abilities.
  - Collaborative mindset and ability to work effectively in a
    globally distributed team.
  - Passion for building reliable, elegant systems that solve
    complex problems.
  - Self-driven, curious, and eager to innovate at the
    intersection of AI and data.

  that’s loved by its customers and primed to be a core part
  of the cloud data stack.
