  Seekho, a Series B, fast-scaling startup , is redefining
  micro-learning for millions.
  
  Our next leap? Become an AI company at the core — not just a
  learning platform using AI.
  
  We don’t add AI features... We rebuild systems around
  intelligence.
  
  If you like owning outcomes, learning daily, and building
  cool stuff — read on.
  
  What You’ll Own
  
  - Drive Seekho’s AI direction from an engineering lens
  - Run a weekly AI pipeline: Idea → Hypothesis → POC → Evaluate
    → Recommend
  - Build and demo sharp AI POCs (retention, personalization,
    engagement)
  - Decide what we build, buy, or skip — backed by evidence
  - Define clear evaluation frameworks (offline + online
    metrics)
  - Convert winning POCs into implementation-ready specs
  - Shape Seekho’s AI layer with practical, testable bets
  
  You don’t wait for roadmaps. You create them.
  
  Requirements
  
  - 5–6 years experience in applied AI / ML
  - Strong hands-on LLM engineering (prompting, RAG, agents,
    eval pipelines)
  - Conversational AI experience preferred
  - Solid ML fundamentals (ranking, recsys, experimentation,
    error analysis)
  - Rapid prototyping skills — ideas to POCs in days
  - Applied research mindset — signal > hype
  - Production awareness — latency, cost, guardrails, monitoring
  - Strong Python + modern AI stack (OpenAI/Anthropic APIs,
    vector DBs, orchestration frameworks)
  - Clear communicator — sharp experiment readouts, crisp
    decisions
