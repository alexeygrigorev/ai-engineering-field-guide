  CoreWeave, the AI Hyperscaler™, acquired Weights & Biases to
  create the most powerful end-to-end platform to develop,
  deploy, and iterate AI faster. Since 2017, CoreWeave has
  operated a growing footprint of data centers covering every
  region of the US and across Europe, and was ranked as one of
  the TIME100 most influential companies of 2024. By bringing
  together CoreWeave’s industry-leading cloud infrastructure
  with the best-in-class tools AI practitioners know and love
  from Weights & Biases, we’re setting a new standard for how
  AI is built, trained, and scaled.
  
  The integration of our teams and technologies is
  accelerating our shared mission: to empower developers with
  the tools and infrastructure they need to push the
  boundaries of what AI can do. From experiment tracking and
  model optimization to high-performance training clusters,
  agent building, and inference at scale, we’re combining
  forces to serve the full AI lifecycle — all in one seamless
  platform.
  
  Weights & Biases has long been trusted by over 1,500
  organizations — including Nvidia, Canva, Cohere, Meta,
  Snowflake, Square, Toyota, and Amazon — to build better
  models, AI agents and applications. Now, as part of
  CoreWeave, that impact is amplified across a broader
  ecosystem of AI innovators, researchers, and enterprises.
  
  As we unite under one vision, we’re looking for bold
  thinkers and agile builders who are excited to shape the
  future of AI alongside us. If you're passionate about
  solving complex problems at the intersection of software,
  hardware, and AI, there's never been a more exciting time to
  join our team.
  
  About the Role:
  
  As an AI Solutions Engineer you will sit at the intersection
  of cutting-edge AI infrastructure and the world’s most
  ambitious AI teams. You will help customers design, deploy,
  and scale modern ML and GenAI systems using Weights & Biases
  and CoreWeave’s AI cloud. This role combines hands-on
  technical depth with strategic customer engagement — ideal
  for AI practitioners who enjoy building real systems,
  solving complex problems, and shaping how AI is developed
  and operationalized at scale.
  
  What You’ll Do:
  
  - Own the technical wins by building proof of value (PoVs).
    You’ll be partnering with Account Executives to drive
    discovery, solution design, and successful technical
    evaluations.
  - Lead deep technical conversations with ML engineers,
    researchers, and platform teams to understand their
    AI/GenAI workloads and architect scalable solutions across
    the CoreWeave and Weights & Biases ecosystem .
  - Design and deliver compelling live demos, proof-of-value
    engagements, and rapid prototypes showcasing experiment
    tracking, distributed training, agentic workflows, fine-
    tuning, evaluation, and inference at scale.
  - Architect modern ML and GenAI systems including distributed
    training, RAG pipelines, multi-agent systems, LLM fine-
    tuning workflows, and inference solutions.
  - Translate business objectives into measurable technical
    outcomes such as model quality improvements, cost
    reductions, performance gains, and faster iteration
    cycles.
  - Serve as a trusted technical advisor, influencing
    architectural decisions and best practices across MLOps,
    LLMOps, and platform engineering.
  - Partner closely with Product and Engineering to relay
    customer feedback, shape roadmap priorities, and improve
    the end-to-end AI developer experience.

    Engineering, AI Engineering, or a similar customer-facing
    technical role.
  - Strong proficiency in Python (bonus: TypeScript/JavaScript)
    and experience building production-grade ML or GenAI
    applications.
  - Hands-on experience training, fine-tuning, evaluating,
    debugging, and deploying deep learning or LLM-based
    systems.
  - Experience with modern GenAI architectures including
    retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), tool-using agents,
    evaluation frameworks, and guardrails.
  - Comfortable designing cloud-native architectures across AWS,
    GCP, or Azure, with working knowledge of containers,
    networking fundamentals, and security best practices.
  - Able to whiteboard distributed training or inference
    architectures and then implement working prototypes that
    demonstrate real customer value.
  - Excellent communication and storytelling skills, with the
    ability to translate complex technical concepts into
    business impact.

    using frameworks such as LangChain, DSPy, LlamaIndex,
    CrewAI, OpenClaw, or similar ecosystems. Ability to
    quickly adapt to new frameworks is a huge plus.
  - Familiarity with vector databases, embeddings workflows, and
    LLM evaluation frameworks (e.g., Ragas, TruLens,
    DeepEval).
  - Hands-on experience with Hugging Face Transformers,
    PEFT/LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning, TRL, Unsloth, or similar
    fine-tuning stacks. Big plus if experience using RL to
    improve agentic systems.
  - Experience operating distributed workloads using Slurm, Ray,
    or Kubernetes.
  - Experience with inference optimization and serving
    frameworks such as vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, Triton, or TGI.
