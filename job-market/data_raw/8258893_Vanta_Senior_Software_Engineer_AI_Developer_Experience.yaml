description: |
  At Vanta, our mission is to help businesses earn and prove
  trust. We believe that security should be monitored and
  verified continuously, and we empower companies to practice
  better security and prove it with ease. Vanta has a kind and
  talented team, and while some have prior security
  experience, many have been successful at Vanta without it.
  
  As the founding engineer of the AI - Developer Experience
  team at Vanta, you will shape how hundreds of engineers
  build, test, and ship software. You'll define and implement
  the AI-powered tooling strategy that accelerates our
  engineering organization, driving productivity through
  cutting-edge developer tools and infrastructure.
  
  The Developer Experience team builds and maintains the
  systems, tools, and workflows that enable Vanta's engineers
  to move fast without breaking things. We own the full
  developer lifecycle - from local development environments to
  build systems, testing infrastructure, and deployment
  pipelines.
  
  In this role, you'll lead the charge on AI tooling adoption
  across engineering, experimenting with and implementing AI-
  powered tools that transform how our engineers write code,
  review changes, and ship features. You'll work at the
  intersection of developer infrastructure and AI innovation,
  creating an environment where our engineers can leverage AI
  to build better software faster in a secure way.
  
  What you'll do as a Senior Software Engineer, AI - Developer
  Experience at Vanta:
  
  - Lead Vanta's AI tooling strategy for engineering, evaluating
    and implementing AI-powered development tools (code
    generation, AI-assisted code review, intelligent testing
    tools) that meaningfully improve developer productivity
  - Drive key developer experience initiatives such as bringing
    UI testing in-house, modularizing our codebase for
    improved testability and isolation, and continuously
    improving build and deployment systems
  - Design and build developer tools and infrastructure that
    enable engineers across all product teams to ship high-
    quality code efficiently
  - Collaborate horizontally across engineering teams to
    understand pain points, identify opportunities for
    improvement, and deliver solutions that scale across the
    organization
  - Mentor engineers on best practices for development
    workflows, testing approaches, and AI tool adoption
  
  How to be successful in this role:
  
  - Senior level industry experience as a software engineer with
    demonstrated expertise in developer tools, infrastructure,
    or platform engineering
  - Experience orchestrating AI agents and automating workflows.
  - Experience building, and scaling full-stack applications,
    including backend systems, APIs, and frontend interfaces.
  - Practical experience with build systems, testing
    infrastructure, and CI/CD processes.
  - A knack for rapid prototyping and shipping robust,
    production-ready code.
  - Excellent collaboration and communication skills—you'll work
    with engineering teams across the organization to
    understand needs and drive adoption
  - Familiarity with TypeScript, React, or Node.js, or a
    willingness to learn!
  - Open to using AI to amplify their skills and strengthen
    their work - demonstrating curiosity, a willingness to
    learn, and sound judgment in applying AI responsibly to
    improve efficiency and impact
  
  What you can expect as a Vanta'n (US):
  
  - Industry-competitive salary and equity
  - Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage, with

  About Vanta
  
  We started in 2018, in the wake of several high-profile data
  breaches. Online security was only becoming more important,
  but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing
  companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build
  a solid security foundation. Vanta was inspired by a vision
  to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling
  companies to improve and prove their security. From our
  early days automating security monitoring for compliance
  standards like SOC 2, HIPAA and ISO 27001 to creating the
  world's leading Trust Management Platform, our vision
  remains unchanged.
  
  Now more than ever, making security continuous—not just a
  point-in-time check— is essential. Thousands of companies
  rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their
  trust— all in a way that's real-time and transparent.
