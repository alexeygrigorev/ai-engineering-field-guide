  requirement reviews, API contract validation, and early test
  planning
  
  • Maintain CI/CD pipeline stability by monitoring build
  health, investigating flaky tests, and optimizing execution
  time
  
  • Contribute to framework improvements including reusable
  utilities, enhanced reporting, and better test data
  management
  
  • Participate in Agile ceremonies - provide accurate
  estimates, identify quality risks, and share testing
  insights during retrospectives
  
  • Use AI-powered tools and RAG approaches to extract
  knowledge from technical docs, speed up code reviews, and
  recognize defect patterns
  
  • Stay current with testing tools and practices,
  continuously improving test coverage and automation maturity
