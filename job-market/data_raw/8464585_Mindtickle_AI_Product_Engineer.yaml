  Role Overview
  
  We are transitioning our organization to an AI-first
  operational model. We are seeking an AI Product Engineer to
  architect and build the company’s central intelligence
  engine.
  
  In this role, you will be the primary builder of automated
  intelligence systems—tools that not only retrieve insights
  but actively trigger workflows, and synthesize strategic
  intel across our entire business landscape.
  
  Role Profile
  
  This is a high-impact, hands-on engineering role requiring a
  convergence of three distinct skill sets:
  
  Software Engineering (50%): Building scalable middleware,
  API integrations, and production-grade applications that
  connect our data stack to business tools (CRM, Marketing
  Automation, Support/Ticketing).
  
  AI Engineering (30%): Implementing Agentic workflows, RAG
  architectures, and LLMs to process unstructured data at
  scale.
  
  Data Analytics (20%): Leveraging SQL and B2B SaaS metrics to
  ensure all automation is grounded in accurate, governed
  data.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  1. Building the "Enterprise Brain" (Architecture &
  Integration)
  
  Develop a unified intelligence layer that ingests signals
  from disparate sources (Product Telemetry, CRM, Call
  Transcripts, Marketing inputs) and processes them into
  actionable outputs.
  
  Build robust integrations/webhooks to push AI-generated
  insights directly into workflow tools (e.g., pushing "Churn
  Risk" alerts into Salesforce
  
  2. AI Logic & Agent Implementation
  
  Architect "Agentic" workflows where LLMs are granted
  permission to perform tasks
  
  Implement advanced RAG to ground AI outputs in company
  documentation, historical data, and strategic context.
  
  Ensure rigorous evaluation and guardrails for non-
  deterministic models to prevent "hallucinations" in critical
  business workflows.
  
  3. Data Engineering & Governance
  
  Collaborate with Analytics Engineers to ensure the
  underlying data pipelines support real-time or near-real-
  time AI applications.
  
  Maintain security and privacy standards, ensuring that AI
  agents respect data access permissions across different
  departments.
  
  Qualifications
  
  Minimum Qualifications:
  
  1.Education: Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science,
  Engineering, or equivalent practical experience.
  
  2.Software Engineering: 3+ years of experience in Python
  development, with strong proficiency in API development
  (FastAPI/Django) and building integrations between SaaS
  platforms.
  
  3.AI/ML Application: Proven experience building applications
  using LLM APIs and orchestration frameworks, Experience with
  "Agent" concepts.
  
  4.Data Proficiency: Strong SQL skills and familiarity with
  cloud data warehouses (Snowflake/BigQuery).
  
  Preferred Qualifications:
  
  1.Business Systems Knowledge: Experience working with APIs
  for major B2B tools (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk, Jira,
  Marketo).
  
  2.Workflow Automation: Experience with tools like Airflow,
  Zapier/Make (advanced usage), or custom workflow engines.
  
  3. B2B Domain Expertise: Understanding of the interplay
  between Sales, Product, and Customer Success.
  
  Competencies
  
  The "Builder" Mindset: You are comfortable taking a high-
  level strategic requirement from leadership (e.g., "We need
  to automate lead qualification") and independently
  architecting and coding the solution.
  
  Systemic Thinking: You understand how a change in product
  data schema impacts the downstream marketing automation
  flow.
  
  Adaptability: You can switch contexts rapidly—from debugging
  a SQL query for Strategy to refining a prompt for Customer
  Support automation.
