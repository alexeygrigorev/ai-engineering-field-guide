title: Staff Backend Engineer, AI Platform
company: Home Solutions
location: USA
work_type: FULL_TIME
level: Expert/Leader
description: |
  Location: Raleigh or Charlotte, NC or Remote
  
  Home Solutions is building an AI-powered customer
  acquisition platform that combines voice agents, intelligent
  routing, scheduling systems, and partner integrations into a
  unified operating system for growth. We are seeking a Staff
  Backend Engineer to architect and scale the core backend
  systems that power this platform.
  
  This role sits at the intersection of:
  
  - AI-driven voice and messaging experiences
  - Real-time decisioning and lead routing
  - Scheduling and partner API integrations
  - Compliance-aware dialing systems
  - Infrastructure, reliability, and experimentation
  
  You will play a critical role in evolving our architecture
  from a fast-moving internal system into a hardened,
  scalable, multi-environment platform. This is a high-
  ownership, systems-oriented role -  ideal for an engineer
  who enjoys designing clean APIs, building resilient cloud
  infrastructure, and enabling product velocity through strong
  backend foundations.
  
  Your Day-to-Day
  
  Platform Architecture
  
  - Design and evolve the backend architecture that powers our
    AI-driven acquisition systems.
  - Build and maintain scalable, well-designed APIs
    (FastAPI/Python) serving internal tools and external
    partners.
  - Ensure systems are modular, extensible, and built for long-
    term durability.
  
  Cloud Infrastructure & Reliability
  
  - Own cloud architecture in GCP/AWS/Digital Ocean (multi-
    environment, production-grade systems).
  - Lead Infrastructure-as-Code implementation and environment
    standardization.
  - Improve system resilience, monitoring, alerting, and failure
    recovery patterns.
  - Drive redundancy and risk mitigation across critical
    services.
  
  AI & Workflow Integration
  
  - Support orchestration between AI agents, business logic, and
    partner systems.
  - Build backend services that enable experimentation,
    optimization, and real-time decisioning.
  - Collaborate with Data and Product teams to productionize
    intelligent workflows.
  
  Partner & Scheduling Integrations
  
  - Design clean abstraction layers over partner APIs.
  - Support real-time booking, routing, and multi-channel
    engagement.
  - Build systems that scale as partner complexity grows.
  
  Technical Leadership
  
  - Set architectural standards and raise the bar for backend
    engineering.
  - Mentor engineers and influence long-term technical
    direction.
  - Identify and eliminate system bottlenecks before they
    constrain growth.
  
  About You
  
  - 7+ years of backend engineering experience, including
    experience at senior or staff level.
  - Deep expertise in Python backend development.
  - Experience with FastAPI (or similar modern Python
    frameworks).
  - Demonstrated experience designing and building APIs at
    scale.
  - Significant experience with cloud infrastructure (ideally
    AWS or GCP).
  - Hands-on experience with Infrastructure as Code.
  - Experience building and operating distributed systems in
    production.
  - Exposure to data engineering concepts.
  - Strong understanding of system performance, reliability, and
    scalability tradeoffs.
  - Experience building platforms that support AI-driven
    decisioning or customer acquisition.
  - Strong product intuition and ability to translate ambiguous
    goals into scalable systems.
  - An “AI-first” mindset -  you instinctively look for
    automation, intelligence, and leverage in system design.
