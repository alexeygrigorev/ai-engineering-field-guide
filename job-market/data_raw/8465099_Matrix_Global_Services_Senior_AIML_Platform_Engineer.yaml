  Job Title: Senior AI/ML Platform Engineer
  
  Position Summary
  
  We are seeking a Senior AI/ML Platform Engineer to lead the
  strategic implementation, scaling, and governance of
  generative AI and machine learning capabilities across
  enterprise cloud environments. This senior individual
  contributor role blends deep technical expertise with
  strategic execution, focusing on designing, architecting,
  and delivering production‑grade AI systems using leading
  cloud AI platforms and enterprise LLM frameworks.
  
  The ideal candidate brings hands‑on experience with large
  language models, advanced ML engineering, AI security, and
  MLOps/LLMOps best practices. This role partners closely with
  engineering, data science, and business teams to deliver
  high‑impact AI solutions while ensuring adherence to
  responsible AI and regulatory standards.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Architect and implement end‑to‑end generative AI solutions
    using cloud AI ecosystems such as Azure AI and Google
    Vertex AI.
  - Lead development of production-grade LLM applications,
    including RAG pipelines, prompt engineering, fine‑tuning,
    LLM grounding, and multi‑agent workflows to achieve
    measurable business outcomes.
  - Implement and maintain AI security controls, such as
    prompt‑injection defenses, adversarial attack mitigation,
    data‑poisoning detection, and prompt‑shielding mechanisms.
  - Develop solutions for content filtering, output monitoring,
    and automated AI safety guardrails for generative systems.
  - Design and maintain scalable MLOps and AIOps pipelines,
    ensuring automated retraining, model versioning,
    observability, and explainability with high service
    availability (99.9%).
  - Translate strategic objectives into actionable AI/ML
    Proof‑of‑Concepts and production systems, demonstrating
    ROI through iterative development and rapid prototyping.
  - Shape technical strategy for expanding AI/ML capabilities
    across hybrid cloud environments, assessing emerging
    technologies such as small language models, agentic AI,
    and edge inference.
  - Provide mentorship and technical leadership to platform
    engineers and data scientists on advanced ML, LLMOps, and
    responsible AI methodologies.
  - Conduct technical evaluations and due diligence of AI
    vendors and tools, including emerging technologies such as
    Cohere, Anthropic, and open‑source LLM ecosystems.
  
  Required Skills & Qualifications
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning,
    Mathematics, or a related technical discipline.
  - 5+ years of hands‑on AI/ML engineering experience, including
    3+ years working directly with generative AI and LLM‑based
    applications.
  - 5+ years of senior‑level or executive‑facing experience with
    the ability to influence senior stakeholders and lead
    strategic technical initiatives.
  - Expert proficiency in Python, including ML frameworks such
    as PyTorch and TensorFlow, and LLM orchestration
    frameworks including LangChain and LlamaIndex.
  - Extensive experience with enterprise cloud AI platforms,
    including Azure OpenAI Service, Azure ML Studio,
    Databricks MLflow, and Google Vertex AI.
  - Strong knowledge of MLOps/LLMOps practices, including CI/CD
    for ML (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions),
    infrastructure‑as‑code (Terraform), and containerization
    (Docker, Kubernetes).
  - Experience with real‑time ML inference, streaming data
    architectures (Kafka, Pub/Sub), and edge deployment for
    low‑latency applications.
  - Hands‑on experience with multi‑modal models, computer
    vision, and advanced NLP techniques beyond standard LLM
    text generation.
