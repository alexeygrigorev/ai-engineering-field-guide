  About the Role
  
  We are looking for a Backend AI Engineer to join our AI
  engineering team and help build and scale backend systems
  that power AI Agents for the gaming industry, handling
  millions of customer support tickets at scale.
  
  In this role, you will work on high-throughput backend
  services, AI-powered workflows, and retrieval-based systems
  that support large-scale customer support automation. You
  will collaborate closely with AI Engineers, ML Engineers,
  and Product teams to design, build, deploy, and operate
  reliable backend systems that integrate AI components such
  as RAG pipelines and AI Agent orchestration.
  
  This is an excellent opportunity to work on production-grade
  AI systems operating at massive scale, where performance,
  reliability, and observability are critical.
  
  What You’ll Do:
  
  - Design, develop, and maintain scalable backend services and
    APIs using Python and frameworks like FastAPI.
  - Build and integrate backend workflows supporting AI Agents
    and customer support automation use cases.
  - Develop secure and performant REST APIs for internal and
    external consumers.
  - Integrate AI components such as RAG pipelines, embedding
    services, and inference APIs into backend systems.
  - Work with databases including MongoDB, YugabyteDB, and
    PostgreSQL to support high-scale, low-latency workloads.
  - Containerize applications using Docker and deploy/manage
    services on Kubernetes (K8s).
  - Deploy and operate services on AWS and GCP cloud platforms.
  - Implement and maintain CI/CD pipelines, and actively
    participate in CM/CR release processes.
  - Use observability tools such as Grafana, Elasticsearch, and
    Kibana to monitor system health, debug issues, and improve
    reliability.
  - Write clean, testable, and maintainable code; participate in
    code reviews and design discussions.
  - Troubleshoot and resolve production issues related to
    scalability, performance, and reliability.
