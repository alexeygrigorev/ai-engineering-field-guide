  This role operates at the intersection of machine learning,
  agentic AI, and full-stack development, delivering scalable
  solutions that embed intelligence directly into business
  workflows. The AI Full Stack Engineer will partner with
  product managers, data scientists, architects, and DevOps
  teams to translate ambiguous business problems into
  production-ready systems. You will work across the full
  stack - from AI/ML model development and deployment to
  frontend user experiences and backend services - ensuring
  that solutions are performant, secure, and aligned with
  enterprise standards. This position is ideal for engineers
  with strong software craftsmanship, applied AI/ML
  experience, and a passion for agentic AI systems and
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures. What
  You'll Do:
  
  - Design and implement end-to-end AI-powered applications,
    from data pipelines and ML models to APIs and user
    interfaces.
  - Collaborate with product managers and stakeholders to
    translate business problems into technical specifications.
  - Build and optimize RAG systems leveraging embeddings, vector
    databases, and document pipelines.
  - Develop AI agents with autonomous reasoning, multi-step task
    execution, and external tool/API integration.
  - Implement Agentic AI protocols including Model Context
    Protocol (MCP) and multi-agent orchestration frameworks.
  - Build scalable frontend applications using React, Angular,
    or Vue, and backend services with Python, Node.js, Java,
    or Go.
  - Design and maintain SQL and NoSQL databases (PostgreSQL,
    MySQL, MongoDB, Redis) for structured and unstructured
    data.
  - Deploy, monitor, and scale applications on cloud platforms
    (AWS, GCP, Azure) with Docker and Kubernetes.
  - Implement CI/CD pipelines, version control, and automated
    testing for reliable delivery.
  - Ensure system reliability through monitoring, observability,
    drift detection, and alerting for ML models in production.
  - Collaborate with data scientists, DevOps, and cross-
    functional teams to accelerate AI feature delivery.
  - Mentor junior developers and contribute to a culture of
    engineering excellence.
  
  What You'll Bring:
  
  - Master's degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Data
    Science, Software Engineering, or related technical field.
  - 4+ years of professional software development experience,
    with at least 2+ years focused on AI/ML application
    development and deployment.
  - Proficiency in modern frontend frameworks (React, Angular,
    Vue), backend development (Python, Node.js, Java, Go), and
    RESTful APIs.
  - Strong experience with SQL and NoSQL databases.
  - Hands-on experience deploying applications to AWS, GCP, or
    Azure.
  - Proven expertise with Git, CI/CD pipelines, Docker, and
    Kubernetes.
  - Solid understanding of ML pipeline automation, model
    versioning, and production deployment.
  - Strong collaboration and communication skills to work with
    technical and business partners.

    databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB).
  - Proficiency in agent development frameworks (LangChain,
    LlamaIndex, Strands) and multi-agent orchestration.
  - Familiarity with real-time AI systems, streaming pipelines,
    and low-latency inference using Kafka or Redis Streams.
  - Knowledge of monitoring ML systems for drift, performance
    degradation, and automated alerting.
  - Exposure to insurance or financial services technology
    solutions.
  - Demonstrated ability to lead technical projects and mentor
    junior engineers.
  - Strong portfolio of AI-enabled full-stack applications in
