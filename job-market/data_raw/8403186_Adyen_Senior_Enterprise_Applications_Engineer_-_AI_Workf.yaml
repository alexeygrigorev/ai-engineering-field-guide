  Senior Enterprise Applications Engineer - AI Workflows
  
  Adyen’s Application Engineering team is looking for a Senior
  Engineer who lives at the intersection of AI, Python
  Automation, and Enterprise Tooling.
  
  In this role, you will not just administer our global
  productivity tooling stack—you will modernize it. You will
  engineer Agentic Workflows that automate complex operational
  tasks, reducing manual toil and for our teams. You will work
  extensively with Google Vertex AI, Google Agent Development
  Kit (ADK), and Python to turn tools like Jira, Confluence,
  Slack, Google Workspace and more into an intelligent,
  interconnected ecosystem.
  
  What you’ll do
  
  - Design and build agentic workflows to automate internal
    processes using VertexAI as well as Google’s Agent
    Development Kit (ADK) (e.g., automated support agents,
    intelligent documentation retrieval, automated
    provisioning).
  - Enhance and administer our Google Gemini Enterprise
    environment, building custom integrations for our internal
    tooling.
  - Design, interconnect, maintain, and scale our enterprise
    applications as we launch new tools and enhance existing
    services, with a focus on automation and operational
    efficiency
  - Maintain and scale our SaaS ecosystem (Atlassian Suite,
    Slack Enterprise Grid, Google Workspace, Zoom), ensuring
    they are secure, performant, and ready for global scale.
  - Develop, improve and support internal Slack Apps and custom
    integrations that extend functionality and improve
    communication and productivity across teams
  - Partner with our Enterprise Access Management team to
    implement secure identity and access controls, including
    automated provisioning and deprovisioning across systems
  - Build and maintain Python-based applications, automations
    and workflows to reduce manual effort and increase tooling
    reliability
  - Integrate enterprise applications with Google Cloud Platform
    (GCP), leveraging services like  Pub/Sub, and Cloud
    Functions to drive automation and security
  - Create and maintain clear, high-quality documentation of
    workflows, administrative procedures, and integrations for
    both technical and non-technical audiences
  
  Who you are
  
  - You have strong Python automation skills, with the ability
    to build, troubleshoot, and scale scripts and tools
    independently.
  - You have a deep understanding of LLMs, prompt engineering,
    and applied ML workflows from experimentation and
    evaluation to deployment and monitoring.
  - Experience integrating third-party AI models (e.g., Gemini,
    or custom fine-tuned models) into real-world tools or
    services.
  - You have hands-on experience with Google Cloud Platform
    (GCP), especially in integrating applications and
    automating tasks across services such as Vertex AI and
    Cloud Functions.
  - You’re comfortable deploying and managing AI tools and
    agents, including Gemini, Google Vertex AI, and Gemini
    Enterprise (Agentspace), or similar and integrating them
    into operational workflows.
  - You’ve successfully rolled out and maintained a variety of
    SaaS applications and tooling ecosystems, including Slack
    Enterprise Grid, Zoom, Atlassian (Jira & Confluence), and
    others.
  - You apply a security-first mindset, designing solutions that
    safeguard data and systems while maintaining a seamless
    user experience.
  - You’re a strong communicator and collaborator, capable of
    working cross-functionally to deliver scalable, secure,
    and maintainable systems that support global operations.
