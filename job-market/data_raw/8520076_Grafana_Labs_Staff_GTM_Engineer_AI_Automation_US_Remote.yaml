title: "Staff GTM Engineer (AI & Automation) | US | Remote"
company: Grafana Labs
location: USA
work_type: FULL_TIME
level: Expert/Leader
description: |
  Grafana Labs is a remote-first, open-source powerhouse.
  There are more than 20M users of Grafana, the open source
  visualization tool, around the globe, monitoring everything
  from beehives to climate change in the Alps. The instantly
  recognizable dashboards have been spotted everywhere from a
  NASA launch and Minecraft HQ to Wimbledon and the Tour de
  France. Grafana Labs also helps more than 3,000 companies --
  including Bloomberg, JPMorgan Chase, and eBay -- manage
  their observability strategies with the Grafana LGTM Stack,
  which can be run fully managed with Grafana Cloud or self-
  managed with the Grafana Enterprise Stack, both featuring
  scalable metrics (Grafana Mimir), logs (Grafana Loki), and
  traces (Grafana Tempo).
  
  We’re scaling fast and staying true to what makes us
  different: an open-source legacy, a global collaborative
  culture, and a passion for meaningful work. Our team thrives
  in an innovation-driven environment where transparency,
  autonomy, and trust fuel everything we do.
  
  You may not meet every requirement, and that’s okay. If this
  role excites you, we’d love you to raise your hand for what
  could be a truly career-defining opportunity.
  
  This is a remote opportunity and we are looking for
  candidates from the U.S.
  
  The Opportunity
  
  Grafana Labs is seeking a Staff GTM Engineer (AI &
  Automation) to build our next-generation AI agent and
  workflow systems. You'll spend most of your time writing
  code — designing multi-agent architectures, integrating LLM
  APIs, building data pipelines, and shipping automation that
  runs 24/7 across Marketing, RevOps, and SDR teams. Ideal for
  a builder who thrives at the intersection of AI, automation,
  and business growth.
  
  You'll execute the AI growth roadmap, building internal
  capabilities and integrations that streamline marketing and
  operational workflows across teams. You'll implement multi-
  agent systems that drive results across Marketing, RevOps,
  and SDR teams. With strong technical ability and execution
  focus, you'll deliver AI-first solutions that translate
  business bottlenecks into comprehensive, automated systems
  that drive measurable ROI, accelerate growth, and elevate
  team effectiveness across departments.
  
  This is a hands-on builder role with 60-70% coding and
  systems development, and 30-40% operational enablement
  (requirements, documentation, training, measurement, and
  stakeholder alignment). You’ll be a key driver of Grafana’s
  internal AI transformation by implementing governance and
  delivering automation that accelerates marketing and go-to-
  market efficiency.
  
  What You'll Be Doing
  
  Build & operate GTM automation systems
  
  - Build and operate reliable automation across custom code +
    orchestration tools (e.g., n8n/Workato/Make), including
    CI/CD, testing, deployment practices, and runbooks that
    keep iteration fast and safe
  - Implement modular, scalable, multi-agent AI systems that
    operate 24/7 and integrate with marketing platforms (e.g.,
    Customer.io, Marketo, Salesforce, BigQuery)
  - Own technical direction for GTM automation: design data
    models, define API contracts, build shared libraries, and
    maintain reference architectures used across teams
  - Review code, write tests, and maintain production
    reliability standards
  
  Operate, enable, and scale GTM workflows
  
  - Partner with RevOps, Demand Generation, Regional Marketing,
    Events Marketing, & SDRs to solve workflow inefficiencies
    through agent-based solutions with measurable business
    outcomes
  - Create reusable workflow templates, playbooks, and “how-to”
    docs so partner teams can safely self-serve common
    automations (with clear ownership and measurement)
  - Provide hands-on technical support and troubleshooting for
    AI systems across teams
  
  Key Strategic Project: AI Chatbot Routing & Human-in-the-
  Loop Orchestration
  
  - Align AI chatbot systems across multiple teams (Marketing,
    SDR, Customer Success) to create unified prospect
    interaction routing
  - Build intelligent routing logic that determines when and how
    to engage human resources in prospect interactions
  - Implement tracking and analytics to measure routing
    effectiveness and refine human-in-the-loop triggers
  - Create scalable patterns for prospect intent classification
    and optimal channel/resource assignment
  - Define SLAs, failure modes, and fallback pathways (when
    routing is uncertain, when systems are down, when
    confidence is low)
  - Instrument end-to-end funnel metrics (handoff time,
    qualification accuracy, meeting set rate, pipeline
    influence) and iterate
  
  AI Implementation & Operational Excellence
  
  - Build and maintain secure, documented systems with robust
    PII controls, compliance protocols, and permission
    frameworks
  - Implement company-wide standards for AI prompt engineering,
    version control, testing, observability, and business
    impact measurement
  - Create internal training materials, best practices
    documentation, and scalable frameworks for AI tools that
    enable cross-functional team success
  - Support ongoing AI adoption through hands-on technical
    assistance and system optimization
  
  What Makes You a Great Fit
  
  Technical Proficiency
  
  - 7+ years building production systems and integrations
    (software engineering, data/analytics engineering,
    business systems, or GTM engineering)
  - 2+ years hands-on experience applying LLMs/AI to production
    workflows — not just prototypes
  - Proven experience delivering AI-enabled systems or
    automation (0→1 or major expansions) with measurable
    business outcomes
  - Strong in Python and JavaScript/Node.js with Git-based
    development workflows, code review practices, and testing
    discipline
  - Deep familiarity with Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery, and
    Cloud Functions
  - Hands-on experience with LLM frameworks and patterns: prompt
    engineering, RAG, function calling/tool use, agent
    orchestration, structured output parsing, and evaluation
  - Fluent with AI-assisted development tools (GitHub Copilot,
    Cursor, Claude Code) — you use AI to build AI systems
  
  Systems Implementation & Operational Excellence
  
  - Experience implementing automation systems, building agent
    workflows, and maintaining scalable infrastructure
  - Proven ability to execute, prioritize, and deliver high-ROI
    AI automation projects
  - Strong documentation skills and ability to communicate
    clearly with technical and business audiences
  - Experience integrating with Salesforce (or similar CRM) and
    at least one marketing automation platform (Customer.io /
    HubSpot / Marketo)
  - Background working with analytics, segmentation, and
    personalization platforms
  
  Mindset & Approach
  
  - A hands-on builder who helps others thrive, where you ship
    solutions and enable colleagues to build on your work
  - Comfortable working in ambiguity with high autonomy and you
    scope your own work, follow through on commitments, and
    default to transparency when making technical decisions
  - Favors progress over perfection by shipping iteratively,
    learn from production, and improve continuously
  - Seeks diverse perspectives when designing systems, gather
    input from the teams who'll use what you build, not just
    the ones who requested it
  
  AI & Agent Systems
  
  - Experience building multi-agent systems: agent
    decomposition, orchestration patterns (sequential chains,
    router/dispatcher, parallel fan-out), state management
    across handoffs
  - Understanding of LLM failure modes and production
    mitigations: confidence thresholds, fallback logic, human
    escalation, cost/latency management
  - Experience with systematic LLM evaluation: golden datasets,
    regression testing, A/B testing prompts, monitoring for
    drift
  - Familiarity with conversational AI, chatbot development, and
    routing logic
  
  Bonus Points
  
  - Background in B2B SaaS or GTM operations
  - Active in open-source communities
  - Experience with workflow orchestration platforms (n8n,
    Temporal, Prefect, Airflow)
