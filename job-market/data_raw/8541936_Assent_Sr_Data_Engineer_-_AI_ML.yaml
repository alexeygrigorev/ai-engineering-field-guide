  Company Description
  
  Assent is the leading solution for supply chain
  sustainability tailored for the world’s top-tier,
  sustainability-driven manufacturers. Hidden risks riddle
  supply chains, many of which weren't built with
  sustainability in mind. That's where we step in. With
  insights from experts, Assent is the tool manufacturers
  trust for comprehensive sustainability.
  
  We are proud to announce that Assent has crossed the US$100M
  ARR milestone, granting us Centaur Status. This
  accomplishment, reached just 8 years following our Series A,
  makes us the first and only Certified B Corporation in North
  America's SaaS sustainability industry to celebrate this
  milestone.
  
  Our journey from $5 million to US$100M ARR in just eight
  years has been marked by significant growth and
  achievements. With our $350 million US funding led by Vista
  Equity Partners, we're poised for even greater expansion and
  are on the lookout for outstanding team members to join our
  mission.
  
  Hybrid Work Model
  
  At Assent, we proudly embrace a remote-first work model,
  valuing the flexibility and autonomy it provides our team.
  We also acknowledge the intangible benefits of occasional
  in-person workdays. For team members situated within 50
  kms/31 miles of our five global offices in Ottawa, Eldoret,
  Penang, Columbus, Pune and Amsterdam, you can expect to come
  into the office 1-3 days a week. Similarly, those near our
  co-working spaces in Nairobi and Toronto are encouraged to
  work onsite once a month.
  
  Job Description
  
  We are seeking a Senior Data Engineer, AI/ML with deep
  expertise in knowledge base construction, retrieval-
  augmented reasoning (RAQ/RAG), and Generative AI data
  pipelines to help enable Assent’s R&D toward Agentic AI
  systems.
  
  In this role, you will design, build, and maintain
  intelligent data infrastructures that supply context,
  memory, and reasoning capabilities to autonomous AI agents.
  Your work will connect structured and unstructured
  enterprise data into continuously updated knowledge graphs
  and vectorized stores that empower dynamic retrieval,
  planning, and decision-making.
  
  You will collaborate with AI/ML engineers, data scientists,
  and product teams to create scalable, auditable, and high-
  fidelity data pipelines that feed both assistive and
  autonomous AI functions. This position is ideal for someone
  who thrives at the intersection of data engineering, AI
  architecture, and knowledge representation.
  
  Key Requirements & Responsibilities
  
  - Design, build, and optimize data pipelines for Agentic and
    Generative AI systems, enabling context retrieval, multi-
    step reasoning, and adaptive knowledge updates.
  - Develop and manage knowledge bases, vector stores, and graph
    databases to organize and retrieve information across
    diverse regulatory, product, and supplier domains.
  - Engineer retrieval-augmented reasoning (RAQ/RAG) pipelines,
    integrating embedding generation, contextual chunking, and
    retrieval orchestration for LLM-driven agents.
  - Collaborate cross-functionally with AI/ML, MLOps, Data, and
    Product teams to define data ingestion, transformation,
    and retrieval strategies aligned with evolving AI agent
    capabilities.
  - Implement and automate workflows for ingestion of structured
    and unstructured content (documents, emails, APIs,
    metadata) into searchable, continuously enriched data
    stores.
  - Design feedback and reinforcement loops that allow AI agents
    to validate, correct, and refine their knowledge sources
    over time.
  - Ensure data quality, consistency, and traceability through
    schema validation, metadata tagging, and lineage tracking
    within knowledge and vector systems.
  - Integrate monitoring and observability to measure retrieval
    performance, coverage, and model-data alignment for
    deployed agents.
  - Collaborate with data governance and security teams to
    enforce compliance, access control, and Responsible AI
    data handling standards.
  - Document schemas, pipelines, and data models to ensure
    reproducibility, knowledge sharing, and long-term
    maintainability.
  - Stay at the forefront of AI data innovation, evaluating new
    technologies in graph reasoning, embedding architectures,
    autonomous data agents, and memory frameworks.
  - Be familiar with corporate security policies and follow the
    guidance set out by processes and procedures of Assent.
  
  Qualifications
  
  We strongly value your talent, energy and passion. It will
  also be valuable to Assent if you have the following
  qualifications
  
  - 8+ years of experience in data engineering or applied AI
    infrastructure, with hands-on expertise in knowledge-
    centric or agentic AI systems.
  - Proven experience building retrieval-augmented generation
    (RAG) and retrieval-augmented reasoning/querying (RAQ)
    data pipelines.
  - Strong proficiency in Python and SQL, with experience
    designing large-scale data processing and orchestration
    workflows (Airflow, Prefect, Step Functions, or similar).
  - Deep familiarity with vector databases (e.g., Weaviate,
    Pinecone, FAISS, Elastic Vector Search, Milvus) and graph
    databases (e.g., Neo4j, AWS Neptune, ArangoDB).
  - Hands-on experience with embedding generation, semantic
    indexing, and context chunking for LLM retrieval and
    reasoning.
  - Experience with agentic AI protocols and orchestration
    frameworks such as Model Context Protocol (MCP), LangChain
    Agents, Semantic Kernel, or DSPy, LlamaIndex Agents, or
    custom orchestration layers enabling seamless interaction
    between models, tools, and enterprise data sources.
  - Knowledge of cloud data platforms (AWS preferred: S3, Glue,
    Lambda, ECS, Athena, Redshift) and infrastructure-as-code
    tools.
  - Knowledge of data modeling, schema design, and indexing
    strategies for both relational and NoSQL systems.
  - Understanding of LLM data workflows, including prompt
    evaluation, retrieval contexts, and fine-tuning data
    preparation.
