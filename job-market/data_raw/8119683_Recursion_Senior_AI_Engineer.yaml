  Your work will change lives. Including your own.
  
  The Role
  
  We are seeking a highly skilled Senior AI Engineer to
  design, build, and evolve our internal AI Agent ecosystem
  within the IT Engineering team. This role focuses on
  applying a high-level software engineering mindset to design
  complex, scalable agentic frameworks and platforms that
  systematically eliminate toil. You will be responsible for
  defining the technical standards and building the resilient
  infrastructure that powers these agents, ensuring our AI
  Agents drive operational velocity and effectively support
  our growth in the TechBio space.
  
  The Impact You'll Make
  
  - Architect and implement complex, multi-agent orchestration
    frameworks and sophisticated AI Agents that autonomously
    handle business and scientific workflows, setting the
    standard for how agents interact with sensitive data and
    legacy systems.
  - Design and build the core internal developer platforms and
    shared libraries that standardize agent deployment,
    allowing the wider organization to self-serve automations
    with built-in security and governance.
  - Drive the strategy for autonomous operations and
    infrastructure-as-code, engineering self-healing systems
    that manage configuration, identity, and system health
    with minimal human intervention.
  - Establish the observability standards (LLMOps) required to
    debug non-deterministic AI behaviors, conducting systemic
    root cause analyses to engineer out entire classes of
    failure modes and prevent recurrence.
  - Partner with cross-functional leadership to translate high-
    level business goals into technical architectures,
    identifying high-leverage opportunities where AI can
    fundamentally restructure workflows rather than just
    patching them.
  - Serve as a technical leader for our AI Agent stack,
    elevating the team’s engineering bar through architectural
    decision records, code reviews, and mentorship that
    fosters a culture of technical excellence.
  
  The Experience You'll Need
  
  - 7+ years of software engineering experience, with a specific
    focus on distributed systems, platform engineering, and a
    proven track record of architecting production-grade AI
    solutions in recent years.
  - Mastery of Python and deep familiarity with modern software
    design principles, creating code that is not just
    functional but a standard for others to follow.
  - Comprehensive command of the GenAI stack, including advanced
    RAG strategies, vector store architecture, and memory
    management for stateful agents.
  - Demonstrated experience building shared libraries; you won’t
    just build agents, you’ll build the tools that allow the
    organization to build agents at scale.
  - Expert-level understanding of API design and middleware
    strategies to securely integrate non-deterministic AI
    agents into complex, deterministic enterprise ecosystems.
  - Deep experience with LLMOps, specifically regarding
    observability, evaluation frameworks, and debugging
    complex, asynchronous agent workflows.
  - A rigorous engineering approach to "unknown unknowns," with
    the ability to diagnose systemic bottlenecks and architect
    permanent solutions for reliability and latency.
  - Superior communication skills with the ability to translate
    technical architectural trade-offs into business value,
    influencing stakeholders across non-technical departments.
  - Demonstrated success in going beyond convention to drive
    transformational impact, rethinking what is possible
    rather than just optimizing what exists.
  - A track record of breaking down silos and sharing knowledge
    freely, partnering deeply across functions to reveal new
    possibilities and ensure the team is greater than the sum
    of its parts.
  - Proven ability to embrace iteration over perfection,
    actively experimenting, testing, and refining solutions
    because progress comes from doing.
  - Experience taking ownership and accountability for decisive
    action, following through on commitments and owning
    outcomes rather than just tasks.
  - Experience acting boldly with integrity, taking calculated
    risks and pushing boundaries without ever compromising on
    ethics, science, or trust.
  - A history of operating with urgency because patients are
    waiting, prioritizing what matters most to move the needle
    every day.
  
  Nice to Haves
  
  - Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or equivalent
    practical experience; advanced degrees or research
    experience in ML/AI.
  - Experience with Knowledge Graphs and GraphRAG to structure
    connected data and reveal patterns that simple vector
    retrieval misses.
  - Hands-on experience fine-tuning open-weights models or
    utilizing Small Language Models (SLMs) for cost-efficient,
    low-latency, and secure internal tasks.
  - Familiarity with implementing guardrails and managing
    PII/PHI compliance to ensure we push boundaries without
    compromising ethics or trust.
  - Experience with Terraform or Pulumi to manage cloud
    resources at scale, treating infrastructure as a flexible,
    version-controlled software discipline.
  - Proficiency in designing event-driven architectures that
    allow agents to react instantaneously to complex business
    triggers.
  
  Working Location & Compensation:
  
  This is an office-based, hybrid role in either our Salt Lake
  City or New York City office. Employees are expected to work
  in the office at least 50% of the time.
  
  At Recursion, we believe that every employee should be
  compensated fairly. Based on the skill and level of
  experience required for this role, the estimated current
  annual base range for this role is $112,300 to $163,800. You
  will also be eligible for an annual bonus and equity
  compensation, as well as a comprehensive benefits package.

  The Values We Hope You Share:
  
  - We act boldly with integrity. We are unconstrained in our
    thinking, take calculated risks, and push boundaries, but
    never at the expense of ethics, science, or trust.
  - We care deeply and engage directly. Caring means holding a
    deep sense of responsibility and respect - showing up,
    speaking honestly, and taking action.
  - We learn actively and adapt rapidly. Progress comes from
    doing. We experiment, test, and refine, embracing
    iteration over perfection.
  - We move with urgency because patients are waiting. Speed
    isn’t about rushing but about moving the needle every day.
  - We take ownership and accountability. Through ownership and
    accountability, we enable trust and autonomy—leaders take
    accountability for decisive action, and teams own outcomes
    together.
  - We are One Recursion. True cross-functional collaboration is
    about trust, clarity, humility, and impact. Through
    sharing, we can be greater than the sum of our individual
    capabilities.
  
  Our values underpin the employee experience at Recursion.
  They are the character and personality of the company
  demonstrated through how we communicate, support one
  another, spend our time, make decisions, and celebrate
