  contacts for an invoice; our systems enable them to deliver

  The Job
  
  We are putting together a tight team of innovative product
  engineers to join the AI team full stack. This is an in
  person role in New York City.
  
  - You will own building automation, AI, and ML features from
    concept, release, and integration into the product.
  - We are looking beyond pattern matching, this isn’t a solved
    problem and we are looking for engineers who will generate
    new insights and solutions.
  - You will work closely with company leadership and the
    founding team to deliver high impact projects with direct
    impact on market positioning of the business.
  
  Who You Are
  
  - Proven ability to build green field products, get it 80%
    right, and learn from the missing 20%.
  - Experience taking ownership of projects and driving them
    through to completion
  - 3-5 years of full stack experience in engineering that
    directly impacts the delivery of product and features to
    users
  - 1+ year of experience on products that deliver AI/ML
    inference to end users. Can be anywhere in that lifecycle,
    from training machine learning systems, to creating the
    interfaces users use to navigate inference results.
  - An interest and passion for AI/ML systems, if you haven’t
    had the opportunity at work to build AI/ML systems but
    have personal projects in the space we would love to hear
    about them.
  - We don’t care what stack you’ve built in the past, but you
    will be building with Python, Typescript, and NextJs
    (bonus points if this is already your stack)
  
  Exceptions to the above requirements are made for candidates
  with exceptional stories. If this is you, we will consider
  you regardless of the guidelines above.
  
  Our Phenotype
  
  We are not looking for people who like to coast or shop
  offers for value. We are looking for gunners who are
  attracted to non-traditional success. A specific type of
  person does well here:
  
  - You pride yourself on grit and creativity though you know
    you may not be the smartest in the room.
  - You are obsessed with building and have a clear track record
    of ownership and shipping highly creative, innovative
    works.
  - You are energized by working in-person with colleagues four
    or more days a week.
  - You are opinionated on how product should be built and know
    when to fight for your ideas (and when to dissent and
    commit)
  - When you see someone spilled coffee, you grab a mop.
  
  We’re a NYC-based team working together in our Manhattan
  office.
  
  Even if you don’t meet 100% of the qualifications, we
  encourage you to apply. We care most about curiosity, craft,
  and drive.
