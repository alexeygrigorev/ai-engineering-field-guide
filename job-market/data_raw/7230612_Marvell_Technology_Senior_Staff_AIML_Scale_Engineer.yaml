  About Marvell
  
  Marvell’s semiconductor solutions are the essential building
  blocks of the data infrastructure that connects our world.
  Across enterprise, cloud and AI, automotive, and carrier
  architectures, our innovative technology is enabling new
  possibilities.
  
  At Marvell, you can affect the arc of individual lives, lift
  the trajectory of entire industries, and fuel the
  transformative potential of tomorrow. For those looking to
  make their mark on purposeful and enduring innovation, above
  and beyond fleeting trends, Marvell is a place to thrive,
  learn, and lead.
  
  Your Team, Your Impact
  
  This team at Marvell develops Murals, a next-generation
  AI/ML infrastructure simulation and design platform that
  enables in-depth analysis and optimization of large-scale
  training and inference workloads. Leveraging trace-driven
  simulation, performance modeling, and hardware/software co-
  design, the team helps shape scalable and resilient
  solutions for advanced workloads such as LLMs, DLRMs, GenAI,
  and GNNs. Working closely with system architects, hardware
  designers, and ML practitioners, the team explores
  innovative ways to optimize compute, memory, and networking
  subsystems across complex datacenter environments.
  
  What You Can Expect
  
  - Simulation & Modeling – Implement workflows to study AI/ML
    workloads using trace-driven and analytical models.
  - Performance Analysis – Profile and analyze system
    bottlenecks across compute, memory, and network layers.
  - Networking Studies – Evaluate collective communication
    performance (all-reduce, all-to-all, reduce-scatter)
    across different topologies and fabrics.
  - Tooling & Automation – Develop utilities for trace
    generation, merging, conversion, and visualization.
  - Prototype & Validation – Test distributed training and
    inference pipelines in simulated and real environments.
  - Hardware/Software Co-Design – Collaborate on emerging
    technologies (CXL, DPUs, NVLink, PCIe, UET/UEC, in-network
    compute).
  - Scaling Studies – Conduct performance projections and trade-
    off studies for next-gen AI infrastructure.
  - Knowledge Sharing – Document workflows, publish internal
    reports, and drive peer learning.
  
  What We're Looking For
  
  - Bachelor’s, Master’s, or PhD in Computer Science, Electrical
    Engineering, or related field with 4–12 years of relevant
    professional experience.
  - Strong foundation in computer architecture, distributed
    systems, AI/ML, and operating systems.
  - Solid networking fundamentals including TCP/IP, RDMA, RoCE,
    UET/UEC, and switching/routing.
  - Experience with simulation frameworks (e.g., Astra-Sim,
    Chakra, gem5, SST, NS-3).
  - Hands-on with PyTorch/TensorFlow and distributed training
    frameworks (DDP, Horovod, DeepSpeed).
  - Strong programming skills in Python, C++, and scripting for
    automation.
  - Familiarity with interconnect and memory technologies (CXL,
    PCIe, NVLink, UAL).
  - Experience with profiling, telemetry, observability, and
    debugging tools.
  - Knowledge of collective communication algorithms and
    topology-aware scheduling.
  - Exposure to AI accelerators, memory disaggregation, DPUs,
    and custom silicon.
  - Familiarity with visualization tools (Perfetto, Chrome
    Tracing, Chakra Timeline, Flamegraphs).
  - Experience with large-scale AI training pipelines and
    scaling studies.
  - Interest in energy/performance trade-offs and resilience
    techniques.
