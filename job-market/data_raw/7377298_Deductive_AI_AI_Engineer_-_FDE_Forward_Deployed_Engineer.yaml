  We are a team of world-class AI researchers and engineers
  with backgrounds spanning UC Berkeley, IIT, Meta, Google,
  Amazon, Databricks, and ThoughtSpot. We combine deep
  academic research with hands-on industry experience to push
  the boundaries of what AI can do for reliability
  engineering.
  
  Role Overview
  
  As a Forward Deployed Engineer, you’ll work directly with
  customers to help them realize the value of Deductive during
  POCs and rollouts. You’ll learn how their teams handle
  incidents and reliability challenges, then adapt and extend
  our AI platform to fit their needs. This role blends
  technical problem-solving with customer collaboration,
  configuring and fine-tuning Deductive to deliver clear,
  measurable outcomes. You’ll work closely with our Go-to-
  Market and Engineering teams, serving as the voice of the
  customer.

  - Build automations and scripts that extend Deductive across
    observability platforms, codebases, and knowledge systems.
  - Collaborate with Product and Engineering to translate
    customer insights into product enhancements and reusable
    best practices.
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - 3+ years of experience as Software Engineer, Platform
    Engineer or Site Reliability Engineer
  - Strong fundamentals and expertise in cloud infrastructure
    (e.g. AWS, GCP, Kubernetes) and observability (e.g.
    Datadog, Grafana, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry)
  - Strong programming skills to build automations using one or
    more scripting languages (e.g. python).
  - Proven track record in fast-moving, ambiguous situations
    where both precision and urgency matter.
  - Strong Plus: Experience working directly with customers in
    roles like Forward Deployed Engineer, Sales or Solutions
    Engineer.
