  About Aspora
  
  People on the move deserve a bank that moves with them.
  Since 2022, Aspora has been building a borderless financial
  operating system that makes money as mobile and transparent
  as its users.
  
  Backed by influential venture capitalists like Sequoia
  Capital, Greylock Partners, Hummingbird Ventures, Y
  Combinator & Global Founders Capital. We're a team of 75+
  across India, the UK, the UAE, EU and the US, working with
  extreme ownership, radical candour, and an obsession with
  customer impact.
  
  We celebrate builders who question assumptions, ship fast,
  and turn regulatory complexity into elegant solutions. If
  you’re driven to redefine what global banking can be, we’d
  love to build the future with you.
  
  About the Role
  
  As an AI Engineer at Aspora, you’ll start by shipping
  internal automation tools and workflows, and then extend the
  same AI capabilities into the product. This is a full-stack,
  production ownership role to build and scale intelligent
  systems at Aspora.
  
  If you like building systems that actually run in production
  and you care about reliability, latency, and cost
  optimization, this role will fit. If you enjoy building from
  scratch, solving complex distributed-systems challenges, and
  operating at a pace where ideas turn into shipped features
  quickly - you’ll feel right at home at Aspora.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Own the serving and runtime layer for all LLM-powered
    features, ensuring low latency, high reliability, and cost
    efficiency in production.
  - Integrate LLM and agent capabilities into real product
    workflows, including tool calling, routing, guardrails,
    and safe failure modes.
  - Build reliable, observable AI workflows across product, ops,
    and data systems, with strong foundations in retries,
    idempotency, fallbacks, and human-in-the-loop patterns.
  - Design and operate retrieval and knowledge systems end-to-
    end, from ingestion and indexing to retrieval and response
    composition.
  - Automate and harden operational processes, turning manual
    workflows into scalable, measurable pipelines.
  - Own performance, reliability, and operational excellence
    across AI systems, measuring end-to-end latency, removing
    bottlenecks, and implementing pragmatic reliability
    patterns.
  - Instrument and monitor AI systems in production, tracking
    quality regressions, drift, prompt failures, and retrieval
    issues with logs, metrics, and traces.
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - At least 5 years of experience training, deploying, and
    scaling AI/ML models in production environments.
  - You understand the pace and mindset of a startup and are
    excited to contribute to its growth and culture.
  - Hands-on experience integrating third-party LLM APIs in
    production environments.
  - Practical understanding of MLOps/LLMOps concerns:
    evaluation, monitoring, rollouts, incident response.
  - Curiosity and drive to experiment with advanced AI
    techniques while staying grounded in production impact.
  - Strong bias for measurable improvements: latency, cost,
    reliability.
  
  Why Join Aspora
  
  - Build high-impact, zero-to-one systems that directly
    influence the product’s future.
  - Drive architecture and technical direction in a culture that
    values deep engineering thinking.
  - Work with a lean, high-ownership team where your
    contributions are visible and meaningful.
  - Grow with a fast-scaling startup where you help shape both
    the platform and the engineering culture.
  - Competitive compensation and equity, aligned with
    experience, impact and market standards.
  - Learning & development support, including professional
    development budgets and learning stipends.
  - Wellness and team engagement programs to support work-life
    integration and collaboration.
