  About Us:
  
  Monarch is a powerful, all-in-one personal finance platform
  designed to help make the complexity of finances feel simple
  again. Since launching in 2021, we’ve become the top-
  recommended personal finance app by users and experts. Our
  goal? To take the stress out of finances so our members can
  focus on what truly matters.
  
  We are a team of do-ers led by experienced entrepreneurs who
  are passionate about helping our members reach their
  financial goals. We are hyper focused on building a product
  people love and continuing to evolve based on user feedback.
  
  As a fully remote company (even before COVID!), we welcome
  applicants from almost anywhere. Our team collaborates
  synchronously mostly from 9 AM – 2 PM PT and embraces
  asynchronous work to stay connected across time zones.
  
  Join us on our mission to transform lives by simplifying
  money, together.
  
  The Role:
  
  At Monarch, AI is the engine powering intelligent,
  personalized financial experiences for our users. We're
  looking for an AI Engineer to design, build, and own the
  features that help hundreds of thousands of users understand
  and manage their money.
  
  You'll work across the full spectrum of AI development, from
  prompt engineering and API integrations to building multi-
  agent systems and fine-tuning language models. You will be a
  force multiplier for Monarch's product, making critical
  decisions on everything from our conversational AI
  architecture to how we evaluate and ship AI features with
  confidence.
  
  You'll collaborate closely with our AI Platform team, who
  manage the underlying infrastructure, observability, and LLM
  routing. Your focus will be on the AI application layer:
  building intelligent features, advancing our ML systems, and
  ensuring quality through rigorous evaluation.
  
  What You'll Do:
  
  - Apply AI to Real Financial Problems: Use GenAI and ML to
    help users make sense of their money, whether that's
    understanding spending patterns, surfacing actionable
    insights, or automating tedious financial tasks. You'll
    identify where AI can make a meaningful difference and
    build solutions that users rely on daily.
  - Choose the Right Tool for Each Problem: Navigate the AI
    toolkit thoughtfully. Know when a well-crafted prompt
    suffices, when retrieval systems add value, and when
    custom models are worth the investment. You'll balance
    innovation with pragmatism to ship features that work
    reliably at scale.
  - Ship with Confidence: Leverage and enhance our sophisticated
    evaluation framework to ensure AI quality. You'll design
    test datasets, implement new scorers, and use our
    Braintrust-based eval system to validate changes before
    they reach users.
  
  A Partnership with AI Platform
  
  - You Own: AI feature development, agent design and
    orchestration, ML model improvements, evaluation datasets
    and scorers, prompt engineering, and feature-level
    quality.
  - AI Platform Owns: LLM routing and provider management,
    observability and cost attribution, infrastructure
    reliability, and shared AI services.
  - Together You Own: End-to-end feature quality, evaluation
    frameworks, production incident response, and AI roadmap
    priorities.
  
  What You'll Bring:
  
  - 5+ years of experience in software engineering, with at
    least 2 years focused on building and operating production
    ML/AI systems.
  - A proven track record of shipping LLM-powered features, with
    deep, hands-on expertise in prompt engineering, RAG
    systems, and evaluation techniques.
  - Strong fundamentals in machine learning: embeddings,
    similarity search, classification, and probabilistic
    reasoning.
  - Demonstrated experience building and using AI evaluation
    tooling (e.g., golden sets, rubric scoring, LLM-as-judge).
  - Excellent Python skills and a history of building
    production-grade AI features and services.
  - Strong collaboration and communication skills with a sharp
    product sensibility.
  - A strategic mindset, comfortable making build-vs-buy
    decisions and designing features for long-term
    reliability.
  
  Nice to Haves:
  
  - Multi-Agent Systems: Designing and building complex LLM
    orchestration with frameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI, or
    AutoGen.
  - Fine-Tuning: Hands-on experience with LoRA, RLHF, or full
    fine-tuning on platforms like Vertex AI.
  - Fintech Domain: Background in personal finance, banking, or
    data-rich consumer financial applications.
  - Vector Databases: Hands-on experience with OpenSearch,
    pgvector, Pinecone, or similar at scale.

    adversarial testing, and implementing guardrails.
