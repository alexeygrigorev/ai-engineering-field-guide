  Company Overview
  
  KLA is a global leader in diversified electronics for the
  semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem. Virtually every
  electronic device in the world is produced using our
  technologies. No laptop, smartphone, wearable device, voice-
  controlled gadget, flexible screen, VR device or smart car
  would have made it into your hands without us. KLA invents
  systems and solutions for the manufacturing of wafers and
  reticles, integrated circuits, packaging, printed circuit
  boards and flat panel displays. The innovative ideas and
  devices that are advancing humanity all begin with
  inspiration, research and development. KLA focuses more than
  average on innovation and we invest 15% of sales back into
  R&D. Our expert teams of physicists, engineers, data
  scientists and problem-solvers work together with the
  world’s leading technology providers to accelerate the
  delivery of tomorrow’s electronic devices. Life here is
  exciting and our teams thrive on tackling really hard
  problems. There is never a dull moment with us.
  
  Group/Division
  
  With over 40 years of semiconductor process control
  experience, chipmakers around the globe rely on KLA to
  ensure that their fabs ramp next-generation devices to
  volume production quickly and cost-effectively. Enabling the
  movement towards advanced chip design, KLA's Global Products
  Group (GPG), which is responsible for creating all of KLA’s
  metrology and inspection products, is looking for the best
  and the brightest research scientist, software engineers,
  application development engineers, and senior product
  technology process engineers. The Surfscan group includes a
  team of engineers, technology development, apps engineers
  and product marketing focused on technology that enables
  wafer, IC and equipment manufacturers to develop, qualify
  and monitor their process tools. Defects and process non-
  uniformities detected on Surfscan equipment allow for early
  identification of yield excursions. The flagship Surfscan
  products include the SPx platforms for wafer surface quality
  and wafer defect inspection tools and systems for inspection
  of polished wafers, epi wafers and engineered substrates
  during the wafer fabrication process.
