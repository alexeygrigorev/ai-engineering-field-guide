  🚀 We’re on a mission to make money work for everyone.
  
  We’re waving goodbye to the complicated and confusing ways
  of traditional banking.
  
  After starting as a prepaid card, our product offering has
  grown a lot in the last 10 years in the UK. As well as
  personal and business bank accounts, we offer joint
  accounts, accounts for 16-17 year olds, a free kids account
  and credit cards in the UK, with more exciting things to
  come beyond. Our UK customers can also save, invest and
  combine their pensions with us.
  
  With our hot coral cards and get-paid-early feature,
  combined with financial education on social media and our
  award winning customer service, we have a long history of
  creating magical moments for our customers!
  
  We’re not about selling products - we want to solve problems
  and change lives through Monzo ❤️

  Senior Staff Engineer: L70 on our Engineering Progression
  Framework
  
  About our Engineering Teams:
  
  We have around 450 engineers out of roughly 5,000 people in
  total - and we have big ambitions. There are many
  interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to
  move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As
  an engineer here you'd be able to work directly with anyone
  across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing
  sessions so you’ll learn heaps about everything from how
  banks work to effective communication.
  
  We contribute to open source software as much as possible.
  Our blog is a good place to learn even more about what we
  do.
  
  About Customer Operations:
  
  This role sits in our Customer Operations collective. Our
  Customer Operations team includes over 75 technical staff
  (Backend Engineers, ML Engineers, Mobile Engineers, Web
  Engineers, Analytics Engineers, and Data Scientists).
  
  Our vision is to deliver seamless support that builds trust,
  deepens loyalty, and powers Monzo’s sustainable, profitable
  growth. We enable this vision by providing tech-led and
  human support experiences for over 14 million customers.
  
  We have three focus areas:
  
  - Automation-first Customer Problem Detection and Resolution.
    We are committed to an automation-first approach in
    customer experience, which includes:
    - Proactive issue prevention: Identifying and resolving high-
      friction issues before they impact customers, with a
      focus on scalable, systemic solutions.
    - Automated and AI-driven resolution: Delivering high-quality
      self-service and AI-powered experiences to resolve
      customer issues.
    - End-to-end customer resolution: Providing platforms and
      tools that allow AI to work alongside human specialists
      to resolve complex customer journeys.
  - Automated Workforce Management. We are building an
    efficient, automated operational model that integrates
    machine learning for forecasting, scheduling, routing, and
    task-matching to optimize our global operations.
  - Solid Tech Foundations and Developer Experience. Customer
    Operations operates as a platform providing a highly
    available, reliable, secure, compliant, and performant
    platform of data, software, and infrastructure solutions
    that:
    - meet the needs of our growing business
    - accelerate the productivity of humans in the loop
    - maintain cost-efficiency that is at most linear to the
      growth of our business
  
  Senior Staff Engineer responsibilities:
  
  A Senior Staff Engineer at Monzo is a technical (IC)
  leadership position. You will have company-wide influence,
  working with other collectives to grow Monzo.
  
  This role will primarily focus on automation-first customer
  problem detection and resolution. You’ll sit at the
  intersection of our customer experience, AI and platform
  teams to bring customer-focused automation solutions that
  improve customer satisfaction and product engagement while
  building a cost-efficient way to scale operations.
  
  More specifically, you’ll:
  
  - Expect to be hands on and deeply technical with code and
    infrastructure, using your software engineering and system
    building skills and expertise to lean in and solve deep
    technical challenges
  - Partner with the Engineering Director for Customer
    Operations and other ICs to provide technical leadership
    around resiliency across Monzo
  - Build a deep understanding of our customer journeys and
    infrastructure and then work to strengthen the
    infrastructure and tooling to build consistent experiences
    at scale; enhancing the tools, patterns and guardrails
    that make high-quality customer experience choices the
    easy ones
  - Work collaboratively with product, data and operational
    leaders to identify and execute on opportunities that
    further the organisation's goals and strategy, bringing
    the right level of clarity, urgency and rigour as
    appropriate.
  - Oscillate between contributing to high-level planning and
    strategy and organisational leadership and diving deep
    into the execution of problems and getting hands-on as
    necessary.
  - Work on solving multi-faceted optimisation problems at
    scale, such as how to maximise the leverage of
    technologies like LLMs, traditional machine learning, and
    efficient end to end systems.
  - Keep a high bar for technical excellence in the collective,
    through your own work, highlighting the work of others and
    calling out when things haven't quite met the bar.
  - Use your expert knowledge and experience to lead
    architectural discussions for the most complex systems in
    the collective. You’ll do this in order to arrive at
    solutions that are robust and optimal given the context
  - Foster a culture of quality within your collective.
    Proactively champion measures to test work, and make this
    easy
  - Pro-actively mentor, sponsor and up-level engineers
  
  🤩What we’re looking for…
  
  To succeed in this role, you will need a strong background

    demonstrated by writing, testing, and deploying robust
    backend services using strongly typed languages.
  - AI / Co-pilot. You have experience in solving human + tech
    problems at scale.
  - Customer focus with a platform mindset. You are naturally
    inclined to solve customer problems through a platform
    mindset that allows solutions to scale across the company.
  
  - System curiosity: You are deeply curious about systems,
    enjoy diving deep to investigate complex issues, and
    understand how modern distributed applications fail and
    scale.
  - Comfort with Ambiguity: You're comfortable working in a
    fast-paced team that deals with ambiguity and evolving
    requirements.
  - Quantitative mindset: You care about outcomes and you make
    data-informed decisions.
  
  What you’ll be using/ What you’ll be working on:
  
  We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies:
  
  - Go to write our application code (there’s an excellent
    interactive Go tutorial here)
  - Cassandra for most persistent data storage
  - Kafka for our asynchronous message queue
  - Kubernetes and Docker to schedule and run our services
  - AWS for most of our production infrastructure and GCP for
    most of our data infrastructure.
  - React for internal Web dashboards
  - Feast for storing our features along a variety of tools to
    train and deploy models.
  
  🤩We’d love to hear from you if…

    product challenges and manage trade-offs.

  - You want to be involved in building and protecting a product
    that you (and over 14 million others) use
  - You have a quantitative mindset: you care about outcomes and
    you make data-informed decisions
  - You’re comfortable working in a team that deals with
    ambiguity and have experience helping your team and
    partner team resolve that ambiguity
