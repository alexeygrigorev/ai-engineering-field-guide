  The AI Engineer is an ML engineer who is responsible for
  building and optimizing machine learning models, retrieval-
  augmented generation (RAG) systems, and verifiable ML
  systems that transform how we search and analyze complex
  medical and insurance data. This role requires a deep
  understanding of machine learning, LLM technologies, data
  science, and software engineering. This is an ML-engineering
  role and not a data science role, which means you should be
  comfortable building production-ready systems. This is not a
  research role.
  
  This is a Hybrid role in the HYD office, 3 days a week.
  
  Job Responsibilities:
  
  - Data engineering: Design and optimize systems capable of
    processing large volumes of data in both batch and real-
    time.
  
  - Design, implement, and optimize retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG) systems that leverage the latest LLM
    technologies to deliver highly relevant search results at
    scale.
  
  - Develop and refine embedding models, vector databases, and
    retrieval mechanisms that maximize search relevance while
    minimizing latency and operational costs.
  
  - Create robust evaluation frameworks to measure quality,
    continuously improve our LLM-based solution based on user
    feedback and performance metrics.
  
  - Build and optimize machine learning models and verifiable ML
    systems that transform how we search and analyze complex
    medical and insurance data.
  
  - Build and optimize production-ready systems that are
    scalable and can handle large amounts of data.
  
  - Build and optimize agentic systems that can reason and make
    decisions.
  
  - Develop machine learning models in healthcare and insurance
    settings with the highest standards for safety and
    quality.
  
  - Stay on top of AI and ML security and governance
    requirements.
  
  Basic Requirements:
  
  - BS in Computer Science (concentration on machine
    learning/AI), Engineering, Statistics, or a related field
  
  - At least three (3) years of industry experience and
    specifically with some of the recent Gen AI technologies.
  
  - Experience with containerization, Kubernetes, and cloud-
    native ML technologies such as Kubeflow.
  
  - Experience with CI/CD pipelines and automated testing.
  
  - High level of proficiency with Python and several ML
    frameworks.
  
  Preferred Requirements:
  
  - Experience with medical coding and clinical policy analysis.
    Exposure to USA healthcare insurance will be an advantage.
  
  - Strong understanding of clinical coding standards (e.g.,
    ICD-10, CPT, HCPCS) is an advantage.
