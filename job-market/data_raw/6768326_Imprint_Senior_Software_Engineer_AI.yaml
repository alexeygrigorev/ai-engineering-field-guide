  Who We Are
  
  Imprint is reimagining co-branded credit cards & financial
  products to be smarter, more rewarding, and truly brand-
  first. We partner with companies like Crate & Barrel,
  Rakuten, Booking.com, H-E-B, Fetch, and Brooks Brothers to
  launch modern credit programs that deepen loyalty, unlock
  savings, and drive growth. Our platform combines advanced
  payments infrastructure, intelligent underwriting, and
  seamless UX to help brands offer powerful financial
  products—without becoming a bank.
  
  Co-branded cards account for over $300 billion in U.S.
  annual spend—but most are still powered by legacy banks.
  Imprint is the modern alternative: flexible, tech-forward,
  and built for today’s consumer. Backed by Kleiner Perkins,
  Thrive Capital, and Khosla Ventures, we’re building a world-
  class team to redefine how people pay—and how brands grow.
  If you want to work fast, solve hard problems, and make a
  real impact, we’d love to meet you.

  The Role
  
  We’re looking for a creative, technical self-starter to
  build the platform that runs agents at Imprint, along with
  the first 50 agents running on that platform to transform
  the efficiency of Imprint’s internal teams and processes. As
  an AI Engineer, you’ll develop Imprint’s agent platform and
  iterate on taking those agents from toys to critical
  capabilities. We already benefit from an array of off-the-
  shelf AI tools internally - ChatGPT, Claude, Notion AI,
  Gemini, etc. - and are looking for a dedicated engineer to
  apply AI (by which we really mean LLM) techniques across the
  company.
  
  You’ll work end-to-end, partnering with organizations across
  Imprint to integrate with internal systems and ship
  valuable, secure agent-based interfaces. You’ll be trusted
  to move fast, experiment ambitiously, and scale what works.
  
  The ideal candidate is a self-starter who thrives in
  ambiguity, loves building, and understands how to balance
  pragmatism with technical vision. You should be comfortable
  stitching together APIs one day and wrangling embeddings or
  RAG pipelines the next. This work will require a mix of
  customer-centric product development, hands-on experience
  with modern AI frameworks, software engineering
  fundamentals, and a passion for automation. If you're
  excited by the opportunity to create leverage across every
  corner of a growing company, we'd love to meet you.
  
  What You'll Do
  
  Platform & Agent Development
  
  - Design Imprint's internal agent platform from the ground up
  - Create 50+ specialized AI agents automating workflows across
    engineering, operations, customer success, finance, and
    business development
  
  Cross-Functional integration
  
  - Build secure, scalable agent orchestration systems
    integrating with our existing tech stack
  - Partner with teams across Imprint to identify high-impact
    automation opportunities
  - Integrate AI with internal systems (CRMs, data warehouses,
    communication tools, proprietary platforms)
  - Transform manual processes into intelligent, self-improving
    workflows
  - Create intuitive interfaces, making advanced AI accessible
    to non-technical users
  
  Technical Innovation
  
  - Rapidly prototype using cutting-edge AI frameworks and
    models
  - Implement RAG pipelines, embedding systems, and multi-modal
    AI solutions
  - Balance experimental innovation with production reliability
    and security
  
  What We Look For
  
  - Strong proficiency in programming languages such as Go (our
    primary backend language), Java, Python, or similar
    languages
  - Experience with AI/ML frameworks (OpenAI API, Claude API,
    Gemini)
  - Production experience with cloud platforms (AWS or GCP) and
    modern CI/CD practices using tools like GitHub Actions,
    ArgoCD, or similar
  - Deep understanding of LLMs, prompt engineering, and agent
    frameworks
  - Experience with RAG architectures and model evaluation
  - Knowledge of AI safety and security practices
  - Customer-centric approach translating business needs into
    technical solutions
  - Experience building internal tools and developer-facing
    products
  - Strong API design and system integration skills
  
  Perks & Benefits
  
  - Competitive compensation and equity packages
  - Leading configured work computers of your choice
  - Flexible paid time off
  - Fully covered, high-quality healthcare, including fully
    covered dependent coverage
  - Additional health coverage includes access to One Medical
    and the option to enroll in an FSA
  - 20 weeks of paid parental leave for the primary caregiver
    and 8 weeks for all new parents
  - Access to industry-leading technology across all of our
    business units, stemming from our philosophy that we
    should invest in resources for our team that foster
    innovation, optimization, and productivity
