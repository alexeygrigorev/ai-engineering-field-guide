  Join us in bringing joy to customer experience.  Five9 is a
  leading provider of cloud contact center software, bringing
  the power of cloud innovation to customers worldwide.
  
  Living our values everyday results in our team-first culture
  and enables us to innovate, grow, and thrive while enjoying
  the journey together. We celebrate diversity and foster an
  inclusive environment, empowering our employees to be their
  authentic selves.
  
  The Team
  
  Five9 has been at the forefront of the cloud transformation
  in contact centers, enabling organizations to transition
  from legacy on‑premise systems to modern cloud-based
  solutions. The cloud contact center space is now a major hub
  for innovation in real-time communications and a leading
  area for the application of Artificial
  Intelligence—especially Generative AI and Large Language
  Models (LLMs).
  
  Our Studio Product Engineering team develops a suite of
  cutting‑edge AI products that leverage industry-leading AI
  technologies from OpenAI, Google, IBM Watson, and Amazon,
  integrated seamlessly into Five9’s robust microservices
  platform.
  
  Our vision is to reimagine the way customers connect with
  brands. Our AI agents will deliver delightful, highly
  efficient self‑service experiences at super-human speed,
  while intelligently incorporating live agents whenever human
  interaction is required. These AI agents will also support
  live agents and empower supervisors and managers to optimize
  their blend of human and AI resources.
  
  This position is based out of one of the offices of our
  affiliate Acqueon Technologies in India and will follow the
  hybrid work model of that location.
  
  Role Purpose
  
  As a Senior Staff Software Engineer, you will be a hands-on
  technical leader and role model within the team. You will
  influence architecture, design, and development across
  multiple products, ensuring alignment with both technology
  strategy and business goals.
  
  This role requires someone who can take a broad view across
  teams, make sound trade-offs, build alignment, and drive
  progress toward shared objectives. You will actively
  contribute code, review the work of others, and be at the
  forefront of applying AI to accelerate software development.
  
  You will provide architectural guidance, lead performance
  optimization initiatives, and improve the reliability and
  quality of our products and services. A strong background in
  designing distributed, scalable systems on cloud platforms
  such as GCP, AWS, or Azure is essential.
