  insights and brings institutional-grade intelligence to
  everyone.
  
  The Role:
  
  We're looking for a Senior AI Engineer to design and build

  - Develop agentic workflows using LangGraph or equivalent
    frameworks
  - Integrate LLMs via SDKs; manage prompts, structured outputs,
    and tool calling
  - Define and run LLM evaluations for quality, correctness,
    latency, cost, and regressions
  - Build observability and reliability infrastructure: logging,
    tracing, retries, state management
  - Optimize performance and cost from prototype to production
  - Mentor engineers and establish agentic best practices
  
  Requirements:
  
  - 5+ years software engineering; 2+ years building production
    AI/ML systems
  - Hands-on experience with agentic architectures and tool
    calling
  - Practical experience with MCP servers
  - Experience with LangGraph or equivalent agentic frameworks
  - Experience designing and operating LLM evaluation pipelines
  - Strong Python and API design skills
  - Familiarity with RAG pipelines, vector databases, and
    embedding-based retrieval
  
  Preferred Qualifications:
  
  - Experience with financial data, crypto/DeFi, or quantitative
    analysis
  - Background in distributed systems or high-throughput data
    pipelines
  - Contributions to open-source AI/ML projects

  - Compensation & Equity – competitive package aligned with
    growth, performance, and merit
  - Career Growth Opportunities – be part of a rapidly
    expanding, global technology company with room to grow
    professionally
