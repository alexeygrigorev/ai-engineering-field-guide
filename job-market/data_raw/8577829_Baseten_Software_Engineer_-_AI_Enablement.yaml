  ABOUT BASETEN
  
  Baseten powers mission-critical inference for the world's
  most dynamic AI companies, like Cursor, Notion,
  OpenEvidence, Abridge, Clay, Gamma and Writer. By uniting
  applied AI research, flexible infrastructure, and seamless
  developer tooling, we enable companies operating at the
  frontier of AI to bring cutting-edge models into production.
  We're growing quickly and recently raised our $300M Series
  E, backed by investors including BOND, IVP, Spark Capital,
  Greylock, and Conviction. Join us and help build the
  platform engineers turn to to ship AI products.
  
  THE ROLE
  
  As Baseten's AI Enablement Engineer, you'll own the AI-
  powered tooling and agent infrastructure that makes every
  person at Baseten dramatically more productive. While our
  product helps external teams deploy and serve AI models,
  your focus is inward: building, integrating, and operating
  AI agents and LLM-powered workflows that accelerate how we
  write code, review PRs, debug incidents, generate
  documentation, and ship faster.
  
  This is a high-autonomy, high-impact role. You'll be the go-
  to person for everything AI-internal, from evaluating and
  deploying coding assistants and agentic tools, to building
  custom agents tailored to Baseten's codebase and workflows.
  If you're excited about making an engineering org of top-
  tier infrastructure engineers even more effective by putting
  AI to work across the entire SDLC, this role is for you.
  
  EXAMPLE INITIATIVES
  
  You'll get to work on these types of projects:
  
  - Agentic coding workflows — Evaluate, customize, and deploy
    AI coding agents (e.g., Cursor, Claude Code, Codex) tuned
    to Baseten's monorepo, conventions, and internal
    libraries.
  - Custom internal agents — Build purpose-built agents for
    tasks like incident triage, on-call support, codebase Q&A,
    and automated change management.
  - AI adoption strategy — Track usage, measure productivity
    gains, and champion best practices for AI-assisted
    development across all engineering teams.
  
  RESPONSIBILITIES
  
  - Own and operate the end-to-end internal AI stack — from
    model selection and integration to deployment and
    monitoring.
  - Build and maintain custom AI agents and LLM-powered tools
    tailored to Baseten's engineering workflows.
  - Evaluate and roll out third-party AI developer tools,
    configuration, and onboarding.
  - Instrument AI tool usage and measure impact on engineering
    velocity, code quality, and developer satisfaction.
  - Stay at the cutting edge of AI tooling, agents, and
    developer productivity research — and bring the best ideas
    back to the team.
  - Actively support engineering teams, ensuring they have the
    AI-powered resources and workflows necessary to remain
    productive.
  
  BENEFITS
  
  - Competitive compensation, including meaningful equity.
  - 100% coverage of medical, dental, and vision insurance for
    employee and dependents
  - Generous PTO policy including company wide Winter Break (our
    offices are closed from Christmas Eve to New Year's Day!)
  - Paid parental leave
  - Company-facilitated 401(k)
  - Exposure to a variety of ML startups, offering unparalleled
    learning and networking opportunities.
  
  Apply now to embark on a rewarding journey in shaping the
  future of AI! If you are a motivated individual with a
  passion for machine learning and a desire to be part of a
  collaborative and forward-thinking team, we would love to
  hear from you.
  
  At Baseten, we are committed to fostering a diverse and
  inclusive workplace. We provide equal employment
  opportunities to all employees and applicants without regard
  to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender
  identity or expression, national origin, age, genetic
  information, disability, or veteran status.
