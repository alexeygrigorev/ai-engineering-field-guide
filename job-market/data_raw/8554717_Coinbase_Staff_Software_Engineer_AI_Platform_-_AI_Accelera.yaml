level: Expert/Leader
description: |
  Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?
  
  At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in
  the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that
  demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging
  onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial
  system.
  
  To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific
  candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our
  mission and who believes in the power of crypto and
  blockchain technology to update the financial system. We
  want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world,
  who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high
  caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep
  leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away
  from, solving the company’s hardest problems.
  
  Our work culture is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if
  you want to build the future alongside others who excel in
  their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no
  better place to be.
  
  While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not
  remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout
  the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple
  times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and
  alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.
  
  Coinbase is on a mission to become an "AI-Native" company by

  Legal, Operations, Marketing, Security) to identify,
  prototype, and scale high-impact AI automation solutions.
  
  You will serve as the AI Automation DRI (Directly
  Responsible Individual) for your assigned pods, driving
  initiatives from ideation to initial implementation and
  broader productionalization, while ensuring these solutions
  deliver tangible ROI and pave the way for broader AI

    opportunities for AI automation and efficiency gains.
    Translate complex business challenges into actionable AI
    use cases.
  - Design & Prototype AI Solutions: Apply advanced GenAI
    techniques, including large language models (LLMs) and
    Agentic AI, to rapidly design, build, and iterate on
    functional prototypes (e.g., AI agents, custom copilots,
    intelligent workflows) that address business needs. Write
    high-quality, well-tested code in Python and Golang to
    support these solutions.
  - Deploy Sustainable Solutions: Collaborate with cross-
    functional teams to evolve prototypes into scalable,
    secure, production-grade AI solutions aligned with long-
    term organizational goals.
  - Act as an Internal Consultant & Accelerator: Provide expert
    guidance on AI capabilities, responsible AI usage, prompt
    engineering best practices, and strategic integration of
    AI into daily operations. Mentor team members on design
    principles, coding standards, and AI productivity tools
    adoption.
  - Drive Adoption & Enablement: Pilot new AI solutions with
    functional teams, gather feedback, iterate on prototypes,
    and support adoption to ensure demonstrable value and
    smooth transitions.
  - Collaborate with Core AI Teams: Partner with central AI
    Platform and DevX teams to leverage existing
    infrastructure, contribute to shared knowledge bases, and
    ensure scalability and security of solutions.
  - Ensure Responsible AI: Work with Security, Legal, and
    Compliance teams to ensure all AI solutions adhere to
    strict security, privacy, and ethical guidelines,
    especially for sensitive data and high-risk workflows.
  - Measure & Communicate Impact: Define success metrics, track
    ROI, and effectively communicate the value delivered by AI
    initiatives to stakeholders.
  - Stay Ahead of the Curve: Continuously research and
    experiment with emerging AI models, tools, and industry
    best practices to bring cutting-edge solutions to
    Coinbase.

  - Experience: 8+ years of experience in software engineering
