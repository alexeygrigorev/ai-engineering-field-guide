  Job Title: Software Engineer, Agentic AI Platform Preferred
  Location(s):
  - Chennai, India
  The Team: AECO Segment, Agentic AI Platform Team Reports to:
  Dineshkumar Sarangapani, Distinguished Engineer, Agentic AI
  Platform
  
  At Trimble, we are enabling our customers by leveraging
  cutting-edge artificial intelligence. We believe that
  intelligent agents will fundamentally transform how
  businesses operate. We are building a foundational Agentic
  AI Platform to power these next-generation applications, and
  we're looking for passionate, experienced engineers to lead
  the way.
  
  What you will do As a Full-Stack Software Engineer on the
  Agentic AI Platform team, you will be instrumental in
  building both the backend systems and the frontend
  interfaces that power our sophisticated AI agents. You will
  tackle challenging technical problems across the stack,
  implementing robust backend services, APIs, and scalable
  infrastructure, as well as developing intuitive user
  interfaces for internal tools, testing environments, or
  agent interaction components. You will contribute to the
  architectural direction, collaborating closely with backend
  specialists, frontend developers, designers, and AI
  researchers. This role requires strong software engineering
  fundamentals across both backend and frontend development,
  practical experience building scalable systems, and a keen
  interest or experience in modern AI technologies, especially
  Large Language Models (LLMs).
  
  1. Full-Stack Development & Implementation:
  
  - Design, implement, test, and deploy robust backend
    components for the agentic AI platform (APIs, services,
    orchestration, data persistence) using languages like
    Python, Typescript, Java, etc. (Python highly relevant).
  - Design, implement, test, and deploy user-facing features and
    internal tools using modern frontend technologies,
    including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, HTML, and CSS.
  - Develop core libraries, SDKs, and components across the
    stack to enable efficient development and deployment of AI
    agents and associated tooling.
  - Write high-quality, maintainable, and well-tested code for
    both backend and frontend systems.
  - Implement and improve monitoring, logging, and alerting
    across the full stack.
  - Participate actively in code reviews for both frontend and
    backend code.
  
  2. Technical Design & Contribution:
  
  - Contribute significantly to technical design and
    architecture discussions, considering both backend and
    frontend implications for new features and system
    improvements.
  - Collaborate with principal engineers, product managers,
    UX/UI designers, and researchers to refine requirements
    and translate them into effective full-stack technical
    solutions.
  - Evaluate and prototype new technologies, algorithms, and
    frameworks relevant to agentic AI, platform
    infrastructure, and frontend development.
  - Take ownership of the technical implementation for specific
    features or components spanning the full stack.
  
  3. Collaboration & Knowledge Sharing:
  
  - Work closely with teammates and cross-functional partners
    (Product, Design, Research, other Engineering teams) to
    deliver cohesive user experiences and robust backend
    capabilities.
  - Share knowledge, document designs and processes effectively
    for both backend and frontend aspects.
  - May mentor junior engineers on full-stack development
    practices.
  
  4. Operational Excellence:
  
  - Troubleshoot and debug complex issues in production
    environments, potentially spanning frontend, backend, and
    infrastructure layers.
  - Participate in addressing issues across the stack.
  - Contribute to improving the scalability, performance,
    security, usability, and cost-effectiveness of the
    platform and its interfaces.
  
  What You Should Bring
  
  - Bachelor's degree (or equivalent practical experience) in
    Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field.
  - 2+ years of professional full-stack software development
    experience.
  - Strong proficiency in one or more backend programming
    languages such as Python, Javascript/Typescript or Java
    (Python highly relevant for the AI domain).
  - Strong proficiency in frontend technologies including
    JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and modern frontend
    frameworks (specifically React).
  - Solid understanding of computer science fundamentals (data
    structures, algorithms, operating systems, networking).
  - Experience building, deploying, and operating backend
    services and APIs in a cloud environment (AWS, GCP, or
    Azure).
  - Experience building and deploying responsive and performant
    user interfaces.
  - Experience with system design and architecture, with the
    ability to contribute to complex design discussions
    covering the full stack.
  - Interest in or practical experience with AI/ML concepts,
    particularly working with or integrating Large Language
    Models (LLMs).
  - Experience with software development best practices (testing
    frameworks for backend and frontend, CI/CD, monitoring,
    code reviews).
  - Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
  - Good communication and collaboration skills, including
    working with designers.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Experience building platform or infrastructure-as-a-service
    components.
  - Experience building developer tools or interfaces for
    complex technical products (e.g., AI/ML tooling, data
    platforms).
  - Hands-on experience with agentic AI concepts/frameworks
    (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex), vector databases (e.g.,
    Pinecone, Weaviate), or RAG techniques.
  - Experience with state management libraries (e.g., Redux,
    Zustand) and frontend build tools (e.g., Webpack, Vite).
  - Experience with MLOps practices and tools.
  - Experience with containerization (Docker) and orchestration
    (Kubernetes).
  - Experience with infrastructure-as-code (e.g., Terraform).
  - Experience optimizing the performance and scalability of
    both backend distributed systems and frontend
    applications.
