  About the Group
  
  The AI Context group builds the foundation for AI-powered
  experiences across HubSpot. We mine, curate, and reconcile
  facts about our customers, their customers, and their
  business processes to supercharge every customer experience.
  
  We operate on large and diverse data:
  
  - Our context platform digests billions of events, calls,
    chats, emails, and other unstructured documents to keep
    our views on our customers’ businesses up to date and
    actionable
  - The platform is not a single pipeline, but a full ecosystem
    of ingestion pipelines, storage layers, synchronization
    systems, AI/ML data infrastructure, and developer
    frameworks to power the next generation of intelligent,
    extensible AI features.
  
  About the Role
  
  We’re looking for a Principal Software Engineer to play a
  defining role in this platform’s future. This individual
  will have a proven track record of delivering projects with
  significant product-line or company-level impact, often in
  ambiguous or complex technical environments. They move
  across domains with ease, challenge existing assumptions,
  and redefine what’s possible through deep architectural
  thinking and strong execution.
  
  At HubSpot, Principal Engineers are not only technical
  strategists but builders: trusted with end-to-end delivery
  of complex initiatives. This engineer will help shape the
  technical direction of a critical strategic differentiator
  for HubSpot and industry standards for a critical component
  in the emerging AI stack – the context layer.
  
  Key Expectations
  
  - Platform-scale ownership: Helps influence/drive technical
    direction across the entire AI context group. You’ll work
    across ingestion, processing, storage, sync, reliability,
    and intelligence surfaces.
  - AI/ML Fluency: our group is made of world class experts in
    machine learning and AI and we help power AI experiences
    across HubSpot. The depths of your skill and expertise
    will be tested internally by our systems and externally by
    our partners.
  - Hands-on, high-leverage contributor: You ship software—not
    just prototypes. We expect deep technical engagement in
    the systems you influence, including ownership of large,
    high-impact initiatives.
  - Distributed systems expertise: You’ve operated and evolved
    large-scale, fault-tolerant, cost-efficient systems.
    You’re comfortable scaling across billions of events per
    day and guiding design around availability, throughput,
    and latency.
  - Architectural leadership: You define and drive reusable
    platform patterns across ingestion, processing, quality,
    sync, and observability.
  - Strategy alignment: You align platform architecture with
    HubSpot’s CRM, AI/ML, and extensibility goals, ensuring
    infrastructure enables product evolution—not constrains
    it.
  - Technical mentorship & leadership: You’re recognized as a
    mentor and multiplier. Others seek your input for design
    reviews, incident postmortems, and architectural bets.
  - Cross-functional influence: You partner with product and
    engineering leadership to define strategy, scope
    opportunities, and execute for product-line-wide outcomes.
  - Rapid domain acquisition: You move into unfamiliar areas
    quickly and meaningfully contribute—whether it’s a new
    tech stack, domain model, or organizational challenge.
  - Internal and external impact: You elevate HubSpot’s brand,
    help attract and retain senior talent, and share your
    knowledge across the company.
