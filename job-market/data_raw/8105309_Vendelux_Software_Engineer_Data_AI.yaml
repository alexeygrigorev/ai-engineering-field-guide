  Vendelux helps companies discover the best events. Event
  marketers are the unsung heroes of successful companies.
  From generating leads to building world-class brands, event
  marketers make magic happen throughout the year. Vendelux is
  here to help maximize the impact of all the events that a
  company sponsors and attends.
  
  We are a Series A SaaS company and provide the system of
  record for event marketing. Our software platform provides
  proprietary insights that helps high-growth companies find
  the highest ROI events, conferences and trade shows to
  attend and sponsor. We have built an AI-powered platform
  that customers describe as an event marketer’s dream.
  
  Vendelux was founded in 2021, and our recent $14 million
  Series A was led by FirstMark, whose portfolio includes
  companies like Shopify, Pinterest, Discord, Airbnb, Draft
  Kings, Carta and Justworks (amongst others). Our leadership
  team includes alumni from Bain, ZoomInfo, Shutterstock,
  Compass, ModernLoop, Forter, Zulilly, NewtonX.
  
  We’re looking for a Software Engineer, Data & AI who thrives
  at the intersection of software engineering, data
  engineering, and applied AI to build production-grade
  systems. You’ll develop, deploy, and scale features that sit
  at the core of our product. This role is perfect for someone
  motivated more by impact than method, loves to solve data
  problems using whatever means necessary, and is eager to see
  their output shape the user experience.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Design & Build AI-Powered Features: Architect, implement,
    and ship data-driven product features, always starting
    with the customer problem first. From prototyping through
    production, you’ll apply the right level of technology
    (whether simple heuristics or advanced AI) to deliver
    impact.
  - Build for Production: Build maintainable and scalable
    systems, including writing clean, testable code,
    integrating with new and existing data pipelines, and
    deploying solutions and services into cloud environments.
  - End to End Solution Delivery: Operate as an end-to-end
    developer in a fast paced startup. This involves
    identifying opportunities, prototyping solutions, securing
    stakeholder support, and productionalizing features that
    deliver measurable business value.
  - Applied AI Innovation: Research and apply modern methods (AI
    agents, LLMs, RAG, embeddings, supervised/unsupervised
    learning) to power new product capabilities, prioritizing
    impact and speed over perfection.
  - Enhance User Experience Through AI: Translate business
    problems into AI solutions that improve user workflows,
    accelerate insights, and drive measurable value.
  - Collaborate Cross-Functionally: Work with business
    stakeholders and other engineers to turn customer problems
    into technical requirements and impactful features.
  - Promote Best Practices: Establish and evangelize standards
    for AI/ML engineering and data quality across the team.
  
  Qualifications
  
  - 3+ years of professional experience in software engineering
    or data engineering
  - Strong programming skills in Python and proficiency in SQL.
  - Experience with modern AI frameworks (eg HuggingFace,
    LangChain, etc.) and designing data pipelines (Airflow,
    Dagster, or equivalent),
  - Solid understanding of cloud-based infrastructure (AWS, GCP,
    or Azure).
  - Experience applying LLMs and generative AI in production,
    including prompt engineering, RAG, and LLM deployment.
  - Strong grasp of fundamental data science and machine
    learning techniques, with the ability to balance research
    and engineering tradeoffs.
  - Demonstrated ability to translate business problems into
    data solutions that drive business value.
  - Proven track record of shipping user-facing features with
    measurable impact.
  - Excellent written and verbal communication skills; ability
    to collaborate across data, engineering, and product
    teams.
  - Startup experience preferred.
  
  Why Join Us
  
  - Direct product impact: Your models will shape how event
    marketers discover, connect, and measure ROI.
  - Product market fit: Customers love our platform; now it’s
    about enhancing the user experience and scaling with AI.
