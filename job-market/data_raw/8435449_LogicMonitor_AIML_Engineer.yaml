    and transformer models (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face).
  - Familiarity with microservices, REST APIs, and cloud
    platforms (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, Docker, etc.).
  - Familiarity with observability, ITOps, or monitoring
    platforms is a plus.
  - Strong problem-solving skills with the ability to drive
    innovation in AI-powered observability solutions.
