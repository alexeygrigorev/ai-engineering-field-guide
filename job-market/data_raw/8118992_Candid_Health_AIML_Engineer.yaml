  About Candid
  
  At Candid Health, we're on a mission to revolutionize
  healthcare by solving one of its most complex and costly
  problems: the billing and revenue cycle management (RCM)
  process. The healthcare system has long been burdened by
  slow, inefficient workflows that waste valuable resources,
  leaving providers with less time and money to focus on
  patient care. With our cutting-edge revenue cycle automation
  platform, we are transforming this space through an
  intelligent, data-driven approach that simplifies billing,
  enhances claims processing, and eliminates administrative
  waste.
  
  The Role
  
  As an AI Engineer at Candid health, you’ll be empowered to
  bring Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning to the
  forefront of healthcare automation. This is an opportunity
  to get in at the ground floor of designing and building
  something exciting and new - generating immense value to
  both medical providers and their patients. You will be
  responsible for translating compelling initial prototypes
  into a foundational set of differentiated, high impact ML/AI
  use cases throughout our platform and across our customer
  base.
  
  We’re looking for a tastemaker and strong hands-on builder
  who can effectively navigate the complexities of our problem
  space – medical billing– and leverage their technical
  expertise to deliver strategic AI- & ML-based solutions
  leading to impactful business outcomes.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Innovate, Drive Outcomes & Apply AI to Real Problems:
    Identify and drive opportunities on when, where and which
    AI/ML techniques can deliver impactful business outcomes.
    Apply industry best practices, leverage state-of-the-art
    technologies and tools to design systems. You are
    responsible for Candid delivering on outcomes for both
    internal teams and external customers through, but not
    limited to, building AI features into Candid’s platform.
  - Scale and Unlock New & Existing Products: Collaborate
    closely with customers and cross-functional teams to
    automate and scale products and workflows with the most
    technical complexity, such as claim submission,
    resubmission, and workflow optimization. You will play a
    role that directly influences product roadmaps to enable
    Candid’s customers to optimize their RCM operations at
    scale.
  - Build AI Infrastructure: Partner with multiple engineering
    teams to build and enhance Candid’s infrastructure to
    better support AI development. Establish rigorous
    processes for model training, testing, and
    monitoring—ensuring they are scalable, extensible, and
    meet our high expectations for security standards.
  
  Who You Are
  
  - Bachelors or Masters of Science in Computer Science,
    Computer Engineering, Math or other similar degree.
  - 5+ years of experience building software of significant
    scale and complexity.
  - 2+ years of AI engineering experience in a professional
    setting, preferably applying it to real world solutions.
  - You’ve built systems that leverage ML technologies (e.g.
    built or used specific NLP models), and know what tools,
    frameworks, and libraries to use.
  - You understand the pros, cons, and tradeoffs of leveraging
    various AI solutions across a wide variety of use cases,
    and can help us make informed decisions around when to use
    deterministic (ML) vs. non-deterministic (LLM) approaches
    to deliver the best ROI, efficiency improvements, & cost
    savings.
  - you know the right architecture and patterns to build
    something of enduring value and scale.
  - You have a customer-first and learner’s mindset, and value
    teaching others.
  - You make the right trade-offs when considering project
    scope, which corners are worth cutting, and which are not.
  - You’re a clear and concise communicator; you enjoy the
    challenge of explaining complicated ideas in simple terms,
    both in-person and in writing.
  - Experience with the technologies we currently use is a plus,
    but by no means required: Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery,
    PostgreSQL, Metabase, Terraform, Python.
