  Job Description SummaryWe are seeking an innovative UX/UI
  engineer who has mastered the integration of AI tools into
  the modern design and development workflow. This role
  requires someone who views AI not as a replacement for
  design thinking but as a powerful accelerator for creating
  exceptional user experiences. You'll be at the intersection
  of design and engineering, building sophisticated interfaces
  that seamlessly incorporate AI-powered features while
  maintaining the human-centered design principles that define
  great products. The ideal candidate will have 8+ years of
  experience crafting user experiences and interfaces, with
  proven expertise in both design and front-end
  implementation. You will shape how users interact with AI-
  native applications, designing intuitive interfaces for
  complex AI features while ensuring accessibility, usability,
  and delight. This is an opportunity to define the future of
  human-AI interaction at scale. As a GE Vernova accelerator,
  GE Vernova Advanced Research is driving strategy and leading
  research & development efforts to execute on the business's
  mission to help power the energy transition. We forge the
  collaborations and help invent the technologies required to
  electrify and decarbonize for a zero-carbon future.
  Representing virtually every major scientific and
  engineering discipline, our researchers are collaborating
  with GE Vernova's businesses, the U.S. government, and more
  than 420 entities at the forefront of technology to execute
  on 150+ energy-focused projects. Collectively, these
  research programs and initiatives aim to solve near term
  technical challenges, deliver next generation product
  advances, and drive long term breakthrough innovation to
  enable more affordable, reliable, sustainable, and secure
  energy. About the team Our Design & Product team is
  pioneering the future of human-AI interaction, creating
  experiences that make advanced AI capabilities accessible to
  thousands of users. We believe that AI should augment human
  capability, not complicate it, and that great design is
  essential to achieving this vision. Our culture emphasizes
  rapid prototyping, user feedback, and continuous iteration.
  We host regular design critiques and AI-UX workshops. Team
  members have access to cutting-edge AI tools and dedicated
  time for experimentation and learning.

  - Leverage AI design tools (Figma AI, Framer AI, Galileo AI)
    to accelerate design iteration and prototyping
  - Use AI coding assistants to rapidly implement and test
    design variations
  - Design and implement A/B testing frameworks for AI feature
    adoption and usability
  - Create intuitive controls for AI parameters (temperature,
    context, model selection) accessible to non-technical
    users
  - Develop patterns for graceful degradation when AI services
    are unavailable
  - Design transparency features that help users understand AI
    decision-making
  
  Collaboration & Process:
  
  - Partner with AI/ML engineers to understand technical
    constraints and possibilities
  - Work with product managers to define AI feature requirements
    and success metrics
  - Collaborate with content strategists to develop AI
    interaction copy and guidelines
  - Conduct design reviews focusing on AI-human interaction
    patterns
  - Document design decisions, AI interaction patterns, and
    component usage guidelines
  - Mentor team members on designing for AI-augmented
    experiences
