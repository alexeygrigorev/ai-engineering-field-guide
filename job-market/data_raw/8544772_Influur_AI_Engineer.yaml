  About Influur
  
  We're building the world's first viral agent. An AI purpose
  built for influencer marketing.
  
  Not a tool. Not a platform. An autonomous agent that goes
  from "I need this campaign to break" to "50 influencers live
  next week" with minimal human intervention.
  
  Why this matters: We have 3 years of proprietary data on
  what makes influencer content go viral. Warner, Sony, and
  Universal trust us to break their biggest artists. We're
  backed by the biggest names in entertainment including Sofia
  Vergara, Karol G, Tommy Mottola, and Tier 1 VCs like Point72
  Ventures. We're not building for hypothetical use cases.
  We're shipping production AI that drives millions in revenue
  today.
  
  Why we'll win: We have what no one else has: both the data
  and the distribution. We have proprietary data on thousands
  of influencers and what makes content go viral, plus direct
  relationships with the influencers themselves. In the AI
  era, having both is the moat. Everyone else has one or the
  other. We have both.
  
  Why now: AGI agents will replace middle level work by 2027.
  We have a 12 to 18 month window before the market floods
  with agents. We're building the category defining social
  media viral agent right now.
  
  What we're looking for: Young talent ready to go all in.
  We're offering significant equity to people who want to
  build something that matters. This isn't a job. It's an
  opportunity to define the future of AI in influencer
  marketing and own a meaningful piece of it.
