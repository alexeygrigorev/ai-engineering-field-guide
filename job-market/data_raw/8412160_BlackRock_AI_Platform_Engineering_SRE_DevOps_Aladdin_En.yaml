  - Establish CI/CD pipelines for AI platform and AI model
    lifecycle management (training, testing, deployment) with
    enterprise-grade security and compliance.
  - Implement observability frameworks and reliability standards
    (SLIs, SLOs, SLAs) for distributed AI systems.
  - Lead incident management, root cause analysis, and
    performance optimization across compute, storage, and
    network layers.
  - Collaborate cross-functionally to translate business and
    functional requirements into resilient technical designs.
  - Stay ahead of trends in SRE, DevOps, MLOps, and AI
    infrastructure to drive innovation and operational
    excellence.
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - Education: B.S./M.S. in Computer Science, Engineering, or
    related field.
  - Experience: 8+ years in platform engineering, SRE, DevOps or
    AIOps roles.
  - Technical Expertise:
    - Proficiency in Python, Bash/Shell for automation,
      orchestration, and AI workflows.
    - Familiarity with Rust build and dependency management
      frameworks.
    - Hands-on expertise with CI/CD tools (e.g., Azure DevOps,
      Jenkins, GitHub Actions etc.).
    - Proven ability to design and scale fault-tolerant, cloud-
      native systems for AI workloads.
    - Deep proficiency in Kubernetes (Helm, Kustomize, CRDs) and
      containerization (Docker, containerd).
    - Hands-on experience with AWS, GCP, Azure, and IaC tools
      (Terraform, CloudFormation).
    - Strong knowledge of observability tools (Prometheus,
      Grafana, ELK) and performance tuning.
  - Leadership Skills: Ability to build and lead high-performing
    teams, drive cross-functional collaboration, and influence
    technical strategy.
  - Mindset: Strategic thinker with strong problem-solving
    skills, operational rigor, and adaptability.

    optimization in Kubernetes clusters.
  - Exposure to secure model deployment practices and compliance
    frameworks for regulated industries.
  - Practical experience with end-to-end ML lifecycle management
    and automated pipelines for large models.
  - Familiarity with ML frameworks (PyTorch, JAX) and MLOps
    concepts.
  - Hands-on expertise with CI/CD tools (e.g., Azure DevOps,
    Jenkins, GitHub Actions etc.).
