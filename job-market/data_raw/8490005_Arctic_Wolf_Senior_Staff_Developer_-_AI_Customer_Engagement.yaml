  language models (LLMs) to provide added context and
  assistance within the Arctic Wolf Unified Portal. It allows
  for natural language interaction, enabling customers to ask
  questions and gain more context about their security
  environment.

  - Architect and implement MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
    and tools to support AI-driven workflows.
  - Implement advanced prompting techniques, RAG, and few-shot
    learning to improve detection accuracy and contextual
    reasoning.
  - Champion engineering excellence by enforcing best practices
    in code quality, security, performance, and reliability.
  - Lead technical planning, backlog grooming, and code reviews
    to ensure alignment with product and business goals.
  - Drive system design discussions, make architectural
    decisions, and guide teams through technical trade-offs.
  - Partner with DevOps, Security, and Product teams to ensure
    efficient, secure, and observable systems.
  - Lead incident response and root cause analysis, and
    implement improvements to increase system resilience.
  - Mentor and coach developers across experience levels,
    fostering a culture of growth, innovation, and
    accountability.
  - Continuously improve team processes and tools, supporting
