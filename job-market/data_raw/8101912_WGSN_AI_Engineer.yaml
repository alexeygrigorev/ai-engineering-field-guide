  The role
  
  We are looking to hire an AI Engineer to join our Data team
  in London.
  
  This is an office-based role out of our London office.
  
  You must be based in the UK and have existing, full rights
  to work to be considered for this role.
  
  Working at WGSN
  
  Together, we create tomorrow
  
  A career with WGSN is fast-paced, exciting and full of
  opportunities to grow and develop. We're a team of consumer
  and design trend forecasters, content creators, designers,
  data analysts, advisory consultants and much more, united by
  a common goal: to create tomorrow.
  
  WGSN's trusted consumer and design forecasts power
  outstanding product design, enabling our customers to create
  a better future. Our services cover consumer insights,
  beauty, consumer tech, fashion, interiors, lifestyle, food
  and drink forecasting, data analytics and expert advisory.
  If you are an expert in your field, we want to hear from
  you.
  
  Role overview
  
  The foundation of WGSN is our passionate experts. WGSN seeks
  talent globally to work within a business that offers a
  unique blend of specialist problem solvers, engineers, data
  scientists, and innovative thinkers who put trends,
  creativity and data together to create tomorrow.
  
  As a Full-Stack AI Engineer, you will be responsible for
  taking AI/LLM models from prototype to production-grade
  systems that power WGSN products and internal tools. You
  will be a core member of the Data Science and Engineering
  function, working closely with data scientists, machine
  learning engineers, data engineers, and product teams to
  operationalise models reliably and at scale.
  
  This role requires strong engineering expertise and the
  ability to transform PoC outputs into robust, secure, high-
  performing services. You will design and build APIs,
  inference services, CI/CD pipelines, evaluation frameworks,
  vector search capabilities, and monitoring systems. This
  role is essential to enabling WGSN’s next-generation AI
  capabilities and ensuring models deliver consistent, high-
  quality performance in production environments.
  
  This position requires a highly pro-active, hands-on
  engineer who enjoys problem-solving, fast learning, and
  working across the full AI lifecycle.
  
  Key accountabilities
  
  AI Architecture & Model Engineering
  
  - Build, deploy and maintain production-grade LLM and
    multimodal models.
  
  - Convert experimental notebooks into robust, testable,
    production-ready services.
  
  - Design and implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
    systems, semantic search pipelines, embeddings, and vector
    search infrastructure.
  
  ML/LLM Operations (LLMOps / MLOps)
  
  - Develop CI/CD pipelines for model deployment, versioning,
    evaluation and rollback.
  
  - Build scalable inference infrastructure using Docker,
    Kubernetes, and AWS services including Lambda, ECS/EKS,
    API Gateway, S3 and CloudWatch.
  
  - Implement and maintain monitoring for latency, throughput,
    drift, hallucinations, quality, reliability and
    operational cost.
  
  Backend Engineering
  
  - Design and develop robust APIs and microservices
    (Python/FastAPI preferred) to expose AI functionality into
    WGSN products.
  
  - Optimise inference performance through batching, caching,
    autoscaling and efficient resource utilisation.
  
  - Ensure all AI services meet reliability, scalability,
    performance and security requirements.
  
  Data Quality, Evaluation & Governance
  
  - Collaborate with Data Engineering and DataOps teams to
    ensure high-quality, reliable data pipelines for AI
    training and inference.
  
  - Build automated evaluation pipelines, test suites and
    guardrail systems to ensure safe, predictable model
    behaviour.
  
  - Contribute to AI governance, safety, compliance and
    responsible-AI frameworks.
  
  Cross-functional Collaboration
  
  - Work closely with data scientists, machine learning
    engineers, data engineers, analysts, platform engineers,
    designers and product managers to embed models into
    production features.
  
  - Communicate complex technical concepts clearly and
    effectively to non-technical stakeholders.
  
  Continuous Learning
  
  - Stay current on developments in LLMs, multimodal AI,
    optimisation techniques, AWS technologies and modern
    MLOps/LLMOps practices.
  
  - Evaluate emerging tools, frameworks and best practices to
    enhance scalability, performance, reliability and
    developer efficiency.
  
  This list is not exhaustive and there may be other
  activities you are required to deliver.
