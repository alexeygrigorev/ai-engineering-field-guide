  We're looking for a Staff Software Engineer with deep
  experience in AI/ML to join the Notebooks team. Datadog
  Notebooks provide a flexible tool for ad-hoc data analysis,
  collaborative investigations, and technical documentation.
  Its fluidity makes it an ideal surface for agents and humans
  to interact. The Notebook team is building AI-driven
  workflows for natural-language data analysis, assisted graph
  generation, automated investigations, and more. You will act
  as a technical leader in this domain, focused on building
  industry-leader AI-powered features. We’re looking for a
  product-minded ML engineer with strong technical expertise,
  excellent communication skills, and a track record of
  driving impactful initiatives end to end.
  
  At Datadog, we place value in our office culture - the
  relationships and collaboration it builds and the creativity
  it brings to the table. We operate as a hybrid workplace to
  ensure our Datadogs can create a work-life harmony that best
  fits them.
  
  What You’ll Do:
  
  - Spearhead AI initiatives within Notebooks, serving as the
    technical owner for the design, development, and
    deployment of ML/AI-driven features.
  - Shape the long-term technical direction and strategy for AI
    workflows within Notebooks and related products.
  - Champion the full development cycle: from rapid prototyping
    and defining success metrics/evaluations to running
    experiments, iterating, and achieving production-ready
    scale and reliability.
  - Drive product direction with a strong user focus, always
    advocating for the best end-user experience.
  - Coordinate with other leaders and product teams interested
    in leveraging Notebooks in their AI-powered workflows.
  - Develop robust agent systems, including tools, retrieval and
    planning strategies, guardrails, prompt
    management/evaluations, fallbacks, and human-in-the-loop
    processes.
  - Stay up to date with industry trends, guiding the adoption
    of new technologies and evolving best-practices.
  
  Who You Are:
  
  - You have a BS/MS/PhD in a scientific field or equivalent
    experience
  - 10+ years of relevant engineering experience, as well as
    experience acting as a technical lead
  - Proven track record of leading large-scale AI/ML initiatives
    in a product-driven environment
  - You have significant experience in model deployment,
    development, training, fine-tuning, and evaluation
  
  - You are passionate about mentoring others and cultivating a
    high-performing engineering culture.
  - You’re excited about leveraging AI tools to enhance how you
    code, solve problems, and build
