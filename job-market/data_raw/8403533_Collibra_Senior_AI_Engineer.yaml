  improve our customers' experience and enable informed, data-
  driven decision making. We seek someone excited about
  working with cutting-edge technologies to build pragmatic,
  performant AI solutions. You'll collaborate with a team of
  outstanding builders around the world, characterized by a
  love for innovative technology, a desire to solve problems,
  and a continuous pursuit of building simple, elegant
  products that delight customers and simplify all levels of
  data engagement. You will work primarily with Data
  Scientists, other AI Engineers, and Machine Learning
  Operations Engineers, as well as teams across Collibra.
  
  This is a hybrid role based in our London office. Our hybrid
  model means you’ll work from the office at least two days
  each week. This setup helps us stay connected, work more
  closely together, and keep making progress as a team.
  
  AI Engineers at Collibra are responsible for
  
  - Monitoring of the larger AI/ML landscape, including emerging
    techniques and current state-of-the-art approaches
  - Transforming prototypes into pragmatic, production-ready
    solutions which solve impactful business problems
  - Creating, operationalizing, and supporting AI/ML models and
    visualizations to power actionable value and insights
  - Evaluating algorithmic results for quality, adaptability,
    and efficiency
  - Contributing to evolving our platforms for Artificial

    of Collibra’s data products
  - Collaborating with cross-functional teams and mentoring
    junior engineers on AI best practices
  
  You Have
  
  - 5+ years of experience delivering production-grade AI/ML
    projects related to business functions, incorporating
    advanced techniques (e.g., LLM-based applications, RAG
    systems, NLP, neural networks, recommendation engines)
  - Experience with SQL and relational databases, query
    authoring as well as working familiarity with a variety of
    databases (e.g., time series, graph, vector)
  - Built and deployed production code in Python with associated
    AI modules (LangChain, LangGraph, Pandas, Numpy,
    Tensorflow, etc.)
  - Experience with model evaluation, testing frameworks, and
    validation methodologies
  - You must have work authorization to work in London, UK
  - A bachelor’s degree or equivalent related working experience
    is required
  
  You Are
  
  - Deeply technical, driven, and analytical about the insights
    data can deliver
  - Able to cut through hype and noise to identify foundational
    problems and build maintainable, performant solution
  - Passionate about the mathematical principles powering the
    Generative AI revolution and how to drive sustainable
    value from LLMs and other GenAI technologies
  - Experienced supporting diverse stakeholders and working with
    cross-functional teams in dynamic environments
  - A clear communicator who can explain complex technical
    concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences
  - Product-minded with empathy for end users—you consider how
    people will actually interact with AI features, not just
    technical sophistication
  - Eager to both learn from others and share knowledge ; AI is
    evolving rapidly and no one has all the answers
  
  Reporting to Collibra’s Senior Manager of AI Engineering,
  measures of success are
  
  - Within your first month, you will familiarize yourself with
    the existing data platform and data products by diving
    into the architecture, existing products, and the Collibra
    platform ecosystem
  - Within your third month, you will start to deliver new AI/ML
    features into our SaaS platform
  - Within your sixth month, you will operationalize AI products
    into production environments and contribute to our AI
    roadmap
