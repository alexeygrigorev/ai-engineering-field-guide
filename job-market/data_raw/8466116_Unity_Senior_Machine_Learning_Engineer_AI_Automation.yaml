description: |
  The opportunity At Unity, we are building a world-class ad-
  tech ecosystem that connects billions of users with games
  and experiences they love. The Advertiser Growth team is at
  the heart of this mission, owning the online ads delivery
  stack, including auction, pacing, and bidding systems.
  
  As a Senior Machine Learning Engineer, you will be a key
  contributor to modernizing our core infrastructure and
  building the backend systems for next-generation AI agents
  that revolutionize campaign experience. This role offers the
  chance to solve complex system challenges at massive scale
  while directly influencing Unity’s revenue growth.
  
  What you'll be doing
  
  - Design and deploy intelligent agentic systems that integrate
    large language models (LLMs) with enterprise data, tools,
    and workflows using frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex,
    and Semantic Kernel.
  - Develop Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications
    using tools like Azure AI Search, vector databases, and
    secure enterprise connectors to deliver contextual
    insights.
  - Build and iterate on conversational agents that solve real-
    world problems, meet stakeholder needs, and deliver
    measurable business value.
  - Deliver high-impact features by collaborating across teams,
    leading through ambiguity, and aligning technical
    solutions with business goals.
  - Drive quality and performance through automated testing,
    monitoring, and data-driven evaluation of success
    criteria, user adoption, and operational efficiency.
  - Mentor teammates and contribute to a culture of innovation,
    technical excellence, and continuous learning.
  
  What we're looking for
  
  - You have a Bachelor’s/Master’s level degree in computer
    science or relevant engineering-related field or
    equivalent experience.
  - You have 8-10+ years of software engineering experience,
    including 1-2+ years working on AI-powered systems or
    products.
  - You have a good foundational knowledge of or hands-on
    experience with LLM orchestration frameworks (e.g.,
    LangChain, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel) and prompt
    engineering using LLM APIs.
  - Deep GenAI Knowledge: Expertise in LLM integration, prompt
    engineering, and the technical trade-offs of different
    model architectures for specific ad-tech use cases.
  - RAG & Data Engineering: Hands-on experience with vector
    stores (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate), embedding
    models, and data orchestration for context-aware AI.
  - MCP Protocol Mastery: Familiarity with the Model Context
    Protocol (MCP) to build interoperable "plug-and-play"
    connections between AI models and local or remote data
    sources.
  - Scalable Backend Foundations: Strong proficiency in Java,
    Go, or Python, with a background in building large-scale
    distributed systems and real-time data pipelines (Kafka,
    Flink, or Spark).
  - Experimental Mindset: A "zero-to-one" approach to
    engineering, comfortable with rapid prototyping and
    iterative testing in a fast-paced environment.
  
  You might also have
  
  - Ad-Tech Domain Context: Understanding of auction mechanics,
    bidding algorithms, or advertiser delivery funnels.
