  Recruitment fraud is a scheme in which fictitious job
  opportunities are offered to job seekers typically through
  online services, such as false websites, or through
  unsolicited emails claiming to be from the company. These
  emails may request recipients to provide personal
  information or to make payments as part of their
  illegitimate recruiting process. DXC does not make offers of
  employment via social media networks and DXC never asks for
  any money or payments from applicants at any point in the
  recruitment process, nor ask a job seeker to purchase IT or
  other equipment on our behalf. More information on
  employment scams is available here.
