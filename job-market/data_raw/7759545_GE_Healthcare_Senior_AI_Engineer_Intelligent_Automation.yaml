    defining RAG patterns, tool/function calling, prompt

    scalable deployments.
  - Develop APIs, microservices, and integration layers for
    enterprise systems (ERP, CRM, ITSM).
  - Integrate AI solutions with RPA platforms (Power Automate,
    UiPath) and business applications.
  - Contribute to internal frameworks, reusable components, and
    coding standards.
  - Lead design reviews, threat modelling, and post‑incident
    reviews.
  - Document architectures, runbooks, and knowledge articles;
    enable Ops for smooth handover.
  - Collaborate with Product/Business to identify automation
    opportunities and shape roadmaps and success metrics.
  - Establish guardrails, safety, privacy, and governance (PII
    handling, data minimization, prompt/content safety, model
    versioning, auditability).
  
  Skill Requirements:
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in computer science,
    Engineering, or a related technical field.
  - 5+ years of software engineering experience, with hands-on
    development in AI, frontend and backend technologies.
  - Experience building AI/ML or LLM-based applications in
    production.
  - Strong knowledge of Azure services (Azure OpenAI, Functions,
    AKS, API Management) and AWS services (Bedrock, Lambda,
    API Gateway).
  - Familiarity with RPA tools (Power Automate, UiPath) and
    enterprise integrations.
  - Understanding of cloud security, identity management, and
    data privacy.
  - Proficiency in CI/CD pipelines, Docker, and container
    orchestration.
