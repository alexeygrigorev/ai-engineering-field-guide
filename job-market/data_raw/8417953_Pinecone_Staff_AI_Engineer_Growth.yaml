  About Pinecone:
  
  Pinecone is the leading vector database for building
  accurate and performant AI applications at scale in
  production. Pinecone's mission is to make AI knowledgeable.
  More than 9000 customers across various industries have
  shipped AI applications faster and more confidently with
  Pinecone's developer-friendly technology. Pinecone is based
  in New York and raised $138M in funding from Andreessen
  Horowitz, ICONIQ, Menlo Ventures, and Wing Venture Capital.
  
  About The Role:
  
  The Growth Marketing Lead will be instrumental in scaling
  Pinecone's growth engine, blending technical execution with
  strategic growth initiatives across Product-Led Growth (PLG)
  and sales-assisted motions. This role sits at the
  intersection of engineering, marketing, and product—building
  the technical infrastructure and campaigns that convert
  developers into qualified pipeline and revenue. You'll
  architect automated systems, optimize conversion funnels,
  and leverage data-driven experimentation to accelerate
  Pinecone's growth trajectory.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Ship AI-driven signup experiments daily: Build and test
    personalized landing pages, signup flows, and pricing
    variants using semantic search to match visitor intent;
    automate lead enrichment pipelines that classify ICP fit
    and route high-value signups to SDRs instantly
  - Create adaptive activation systems: Build AI-powered
    onboarding workflows that personalize tutorials, code
    samples, and integration guides in real-time based on user
    behavior; deploy automated health dashboards that flag
    dormant users and trigger intervention experiments
  - Automate pipeline generation workflows: Use AI to generate
    programmatic SEO content, optimize for search intent, and
    detect buying signals from activity (Discord, GitHub,
    website, ads); auto-enrich accounts and create CRM
    opportunities
  - Build AI agents and internal research tools: Ship agents
    that personalize email sequences, in-app messaging, and
    Slack community outreach for external users; create
    internal utilities for Marketing/Sales teams to instantly
    look up user context, journey stage, and behavior patterns
    using semantic search over CRM, product usage, and
    community data
  - Build measurement and attribution infrastructure: Create
    end-to-end tracking systems that connect traffic sources →
    signups → activations with causal attribution; automate
    dashboards and experiments that measure impact on
    conversion rates, activation velocity, and pipeline
    generation
  
  Requirements:
  
  - 4+ years building full-stack applications in production
    environments (Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, or similar)
  - Hands-on experience with AI/ML APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, or
    similar) and vector databases
  - Track record driving measurable growth outcomes (signups,
    activations, pipeline) in PLG or B2B SaaS
  - Proficiency with marketing automation platforms (HubSpot,
    Salesforce) and data analysis tools (SQL, Python)
  - Strong experimentation mindset: A/B testing, measurement
    frameworks, and data-driven decision making
  
  Preferred Skills:
  
  - Built AI agents, agentic RAG systems, or semantic search
    applications
  - Experience with workflow automation tools (n8n, Zapier,
    Clay) and CRM/data warehouse integrations
  - Developer marketing or technical GTM experience in
    AI/infrastructure space
  - Early-stage startup background with hands-on growth
    engineering
  - Familiarity with modern data stack (dbt, Snowflake/BigQuery,
    reverse ETL)
