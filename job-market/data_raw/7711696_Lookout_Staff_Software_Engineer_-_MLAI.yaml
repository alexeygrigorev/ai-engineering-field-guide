description: |
  Lookout, Inc. is a globally recognized cybersecurity leader
  delivering advanced protection for the most vulnerable
  element of any enterprise security strategy — human error
  and manipulation. Cloud-native by design, the Lookout
  platform offers rapid, scalable deployment and simplified
  security operations, defending the frontline of human-
  centric attacks—the mobile device. Attackers now target the
  human element more than ever, with mobile devices providing
  the most direct path to their victims. Using social
  engineering techniques that exploit basic human instincts
  like trust, curiosity, and urgency, they deceive users into
  revealing sensitive credentials, allowing them to slip past
  legacy security solutions.
  
  Lookout Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) continuously
  monitors mobile endpoints for signs of human-centric
  attacks, as well as traditional malware, software
  vulnerabilities, and other anomalous activity. It uses
  advanced threat detection techniques, including artificial
  intelligence (AI) and behavioral analysis, to identify
  threats before they escalate across the enterprise. Learn

  LinkedIn, and X.
  
  Lookout’s backend system supports a massive volume of data
  and an increasingly high level of demand, from data
  ingestion to delivery to dynamic analysis. We’re looking for
  talented and motivated engineers to build core components
  and services, as well as to contribute to evolving the
  architecture. We’re a small team working on a very large,
  modern system with a user base of millions, so you’ll get to
  work on a cutting-edge product and service on a large scale.
  We’re responsible for building and maintaining several of
  the services powering the various Lookout applications..
  
  What you’ll do:
  
  - You will be part of a dynamic and technically diverse group
    of engineers, where you will get to contribute, influence,
    learn and grow top notch technical skill sets, while
    building key features for our customers.
  - Own the full machine learning lifecycle, from initial
    research and design to production deployment, monitoring,
    and continuous retraining.
  - Establish and implement robust frameworks to train,
    evaluate, stress-test, and monitor ML/AI systems, driving
    continuous improvement and preventing model drift.
  - Address and navigate real-world scale and performance
    challenges, ensuring all ML/AI models and systems are
    efficient, robust, and maintain target quality/latency
    under production constraints.
  - Set technical direction as a senior Individual Contributor
    (IC) and mentor junior engineers.
  - Quality is the forefront of all we do, so you will assist
    with improving all forms of automated testing (unit,
    integration, functional etc).
  - We believe in, and practice, end to end service ownership,
    so you will fully participate in the ownership of your
    services and components, including on-call duties.
  
  What we’re looking for:
  
  - BS/MS in Computer Science or related field/degree with at
    least  5-8 years of  work experience.
  - A proven track record of architecting and deploying
    practical, high-impact ML/AI systems over multiple years,
    translating complex models into robust, real-world
    solutions.
  - Experience working cross-functionally with data engineers,
    platform engineers, and product stakeholders to bring
    ML/AI systems to life.
  - Expert proficiency in Python and strong software engineering
    skills, including the ability to write reliable,
    production-grade code. In-depth experience with major
    ML/Deep Learning frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-
    learn.
  - Familiarity with modern AI/ML stacks like Hugging Face and
    LangChain.
  - Deep expertise in a wide range of standard ML algorithms,
    including classification, clustering, regression, and deep
    learning models.
  - Hands-on experience with the LLM/RAG stack components:
    embeddings, knowledge graphs, vector databases, retrieval
    strategies, and prompt engineering.
  - Proven ability to measure and optimize model efficacy using
    statistical methods.
  - Hands-on experience with production ML infrastructure,
    including feature stores, model management,
    training/serving pipelines (MLOps), and monitoring tools.
  - Up-to-date with new advances in NLP, LLMs and agent-
    frameworks.
  - Strong grasp of software engineering fundamentals and
    algorithms.
  - Experience with implementing secure, scalable API services.
  
  Bonus Points:
  
  - Practical experience applying advanced techniques to enhance
    model efficiency, including model distillation (creating
    smaller, faster student models) and model quantization
    (reducing memory footprint and latency).
  - Experience with efficient Large Language Model (LLM) fine-
    tuning methods like LoRA and other PEFT techniques.
  - Experience working with coding agents (Cursor, Copilot,
    Claude Code etc..)
  - Experience with event streaming frameworks, technologies,
    patterns and architectures (particularly Kafka or similar)
  - Professional programming experience with Scala and Golang
  - Experience with serverless architectures on AWS, GCP.
  - Experience with Kubernetes, container technology (Docker,
    ECS, EKS).
