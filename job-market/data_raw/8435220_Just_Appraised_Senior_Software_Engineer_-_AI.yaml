  Just Appraised is modernizing local government processes
  related to real estate and property taxes. Our cutting-edge,
  AI-powered software, which leverages Natural Language
  Processing (NLP), replaces manual data entry to eliminate
  delays, backlogs, and errors. With hundreds of government
  entities across the United States relying on us, your work
  will directly help drive essential revenues and provide
  critical services to society.
  
  Join a high-growth, YC-backed, and fully remote startup. As
  the second Senior Software Engineer focused on our AI
  Tooling and Conversation Engine, you'll have significant
  ownership in defining the technical future of our core
  product, Front Desk. This is an opportunity to lead
  technical decisions and directly influence a product making
  a real-world impact. This is a full-time, salaried position.
  
  What You Will Work On
  
  - Build and evolve our Conversation Engine powering pre-
    drafted email, chat, and voice responses, including
    conversation state, memory, and high-quality response
    generation.
  - Own the RAG pipeline end-to-end: document ingestion,
    chunking strategies, embeddings, indexing, retrieval
    (hybrid/vector), reranking, and grounded response
    generation.
  - Implement AI Tooling / function calling to connect LLM
    workflows to internal systems (e.g., account lookup, case
    context retrieval, knowledge base queries) with strong
    validation and safe execution patterns.
  - Design evaluation and quality systems for AI features:
    offline eval harnesses, golden datasets, human feedback
    loops, monitoring for hallucinations/grounding, and
    regression prevention.
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design,
    and ship new features.
  - Work closely with business stakeholders and customers to
    translate requirements into technical specifications and
    documentation.
  - Mentor and support engineering team members, promoting team
    efficiency and growth.
  - Troubleshoot and debug complex issues, ensuring timely
    resolution and platform stability.
  - Optimize application performance, reliability, and
    scalability, and uphold high standards for clean,
    maintainable code.
  - Identify and proactively address technical debt and
    performance bottlenecks to drive iterative product
    improvement.
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - 5+ years of professional experience in Python development.
  - 5+ years of experience with relational databases (e.g.,
    PostgreSQL).
  - 2+ years of experience with cloud environments, particularly
    AWS.
  - Proven experience working with Large Language Models (LLMs)
    and building production-ready RAG pipelines.
  - Strong proficiency in API design, data modeling, relational
    database design, and testing methodologies.
  - Proficiency with modern DevOps practices: version control
    (Git), containerization (Docker), CI/CD (GitHub Actions),
    and automated testing frameworks.
