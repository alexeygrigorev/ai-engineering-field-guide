  Job Summary
  
  We are looking for a highly skilled Machine Learning
  Engineer with hands-on experience in designing, building,
  and deploying ML models at scale. You will work on end-to-
  end ML pipelines—from data preprocessing to production
  deployment—leveraging modern frameworks and MLOps practices.
  This role is ideal for someone who thrives in solving
  complex problems, optimizing workflows, and applying AI to
  deliver impactful business solutions. Additionally, you will
  collaborate with analytics teams to design dashboards and
  visualizations that provide actionable insights for
  stakeholders.
  
  Model Development & Deployment
  
  • Design, train, and optimize ML models using PyTorch or
  TensorFlow for production-grade applications.
  
  • Build scalable data pipelines for feature engineering and
  model training using Pandas, Dask, or equivalent frameworks.
  
  • Implement model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and
  performance monitoring.
  
  MLOps & Automation
  
  • Develop and maintain ML workflows using Airflow, Kedro,
  and MLflow for reproducibility and traceability.
  
  • Automate model deployment and lifecycle management across
  environments (dev, staging, production).
  
  • Integrate CI/CD practices for ML pipelines using tools
  like Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or similar.
  
  Data Engineering & Processing
  
  • Handle large-scale datasets efficiently using distributed
  computing frameworks (Dask, Spark).
  
  • Ensure data quality, consistency, and compliance with
  governance standards.
  
  • Exposure to Snowflake or Databricks is a plus.
  
  Analytics & Visualization
  
  • Collaborate with business and analytics teams to translate
  ML outputs into actionable insights.
  
  • Design and develop dashboards and reports using Power BI
  or similar BI tools.
  
  • Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and communicate
  findings effectively to stakeholders.
  
  • Build KPI-driven visualizations to monitor model
  performance and business impact.
  
  Monitoring & Observability
  
  • Implement model drift detection, performance tracking, and
  automated retraining strategies.
  
  • Use experiment tracking tools (MLflow, Weights & Biases)
  for transparency and reproducibility.
  
  Collaboration & Documentation
  
  • Work closely with data scientists, software engineers, and
  product teams to align ML solutions with business goals.
  
  • Document ML workflows, best practices, and operational
  guidelines.
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  •  5–7 years of experience in ML engineering or applied
  machine learning.
  
  •  Strong proficiency in Python and libraries like Pandas,
  Dask, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
  
  •  Hands-on experience with PyTorch or TensorFlow for model
  development.
  
  •  Solid understanding of MLOps tools: Airflow, Kedro,
  MLflow (or equivalents).
  
  •  Experience deploying ML models in production environments
  (APIs, batch jobs, streaming).
  
  •  Familiarity with containerization (Docker) and
  orchestration (Kubernetes).
  
  •  Exposure to cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, or GCP) for ML
  workloads.
  
  •  Experience with Power BI or similar BI tools for
  analytics and visualization.
  
  •  Strong problem-solving skills and ability to work in
  agile, fast-paced environments.
  
  Good to haves
  
  
  
  •  Experience with feature stores (Feast, Tecton) and data
  versioning tools (DVC).
  
  •  Knowledge of distributed training and GPU optimization.
  
  •  Familiarity with experiment management tools (Weights &
  Biases, Neptune.ai).
  
  •  Understanding of model explainability and responsible AI
  practices.
  
  •  Contributions to open-source ML projects or technical
  blogs.
