  Stuut is transforming accounts receivable for B2B
  companies—making collections smarter and faster for
  companies that have historically relied on manual processes
  that are labor intensive and costly. Our platform is gaining
  traction with finance teams across industrials, chemicals,
  and manufacturing sectors from Fortune 10 brands to scaling
  midmarkets. We're backed by top-tier investors including
  a16z, Khosla, Activant, 1984 Ventures and Page One.
  
  The Role
  
  We’re hiring an AI Sales Engineer to partner closely with
  Sales, Forward Deployed Engineers, and Product to drive
  successful evaluations and adoption of Stuut’s AI-powered
  cash flow automation platform. You’ll play a critical role
  in guiding midmarket and enterprise customers through
  complex technical discovery, solution design, and proof-of-
  value—ensuring they understand how Stuut delivers measurable
  business impact.
  
  This is a high-impact, customer-facing role for someone who
  thrives at the intersection of technical problem-solving,
  business context, and execution. You’ll translate customer
  challenges into technical solutions, design ERP
  integrations, support product launches, and influence buying
  decisions—while collaborating deeply across Sales, Product,
  and Engineering.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Serve as the technical partner to Sales and Forward Deployed
    Engineers throughout the sales cycle, from discovery to
    close.
  - Lead technical discovery sessions and product demonstrations
    tailored to real customer workflows and data.
  - Design and support proof-of-concept engagements with clear
    success metrics (e.g. DSO reduction, collection rate lift,
    automation ROI).
  - Architect integration approaches for customer ERP
    environments (SAP, Oracle, NetSuite, Dynamics) in
    collaboration with IT, finance, and operations teams.
  - Develop technical proposals, solution documentation, and ROI
    models aligned to customer requirements.
  - Support new product launches by contributing to go-to-market
    collateral, training internal teams, and partnering with
    early customers.
  - Surface customer and technical insights that inform platform
    improvements and product strategy.
  - Build trusted relationships with customer technical
    stakeholders and represent Stuut in technical discussions
    and industry forums.
  
  You Might Be a Fit If You…
  
  - Have 4–7 years of experience in Solutions Engineering, Sales
    Engineering, pre-sales, or technical consulting within B2B
    SaaS.
  - Are comfortable supporting complex, enterprise sales cycles
    and influencing six-figure-plus deals.
  - Have strong familiarity with ERP systems and financial
    software ecosystems (SAP, Oracle, NetSuite, Dynamics).
  - Understand APIs, data integration patterns, authentication,
    and enterprise architecture concepts.
  - Have experience with iPaaS tools (e.g. MuleSoft, Boomi,
    Workato) or adjacent integration technologies.
  - Can communicate complex technical concepts clearly to both
    technical and non-technical stakeholders.
  - Bring curiosity around AI/ML, LLMs, and agentic
    workflows—and a desire to learn quickly.
  - Thrive in high-growth startup environments that reward
    ownership, collaboration, and bias toward action.
