  About DevSavant
  
  DevSavant is an operating partner for startups and growth-
  stage companies, helping them turn ambition into execution.
  
  We support founders and leadership teams with product
  engineering and global staffing, from early prototypes and
  MVPs to scaling high-performing teams. Our vetted talent
  across LATAM and Asia embeds directly into client teams,
  operating as true extensions rather than external vendors.
  
  With over 8 years working in venture-backed ecosystems,
  DevSavant is trusted to accelerate delivery, scale teams
  efficiently, and support companies as they reach their next
  milestone.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  Agentic AI & Conversational Systems
  
  - Design and deploy healthcare-focused Agentic AI systems
    capable of autonomous, multi-step task execution (e.g.,
    appointment scheduling, eligibility verification, intake
    automation, triage routing).
  - Architect and optimize LLM-powered conversational agents
    across voice and digital channels.
  - Develop Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures
    to power contextual, domain-specific healthcare knowledge
    systems.
  - Engineer robust prompt frameworks, safety guardrails, and
    evaluation pipelines tailored to regulated healthcare
    environments.
  - Continuously evaluate and improve agent performance,
    accuracy, and safety through structured experimentation
    and analytics.
  
  Voice Automation & Infrastructure
  
  - Architect advanced IVR modernization strategies and
    intelligent voice workflows.
  - Optimize ASR (speech-to-text) and TTS (text-to-speech)
    systems to meet healthcare-grade accuracy and reliability
    standards.
  - Integrate conversational AI into enterprise contact center
    platforms and CPaaS environments.
  - Ensure seamless interoperability with EHR/EMR systems using
    healthcare standards such as FHIR and HL7.
  - Design scalable, fault-tolerant architectures supporting
    high-availability healthcare operations.
  
  Healthcare AI & Compliance
  
  - Develop NLP pipelines for clinical document summarization,
    coding support, PHI detection, and structured data
    extraction.
  - Architect HIPAA-compliant AI systems with secure data
    handling, encryption, and role-based access controls.
  - Implement monitoring, observability, and analytics
    frameworks to measure operational efficiency and patient
    experience outcomes.
  - Maintain alignment with evolving healthcare AI regulatory
    and compliance requirements.
  
  Platform & Developer Enablement
  
  - Contribute reusable AI templates that power no-code and low-
    code deployment models.
  - Build and maintain APIs and SDK integrations that allow
    enterprise customers to embed AI capabilities rapidly.
  - Collaborate cross-functionally with product, solution
    engineering, and co-creation teams to accelerate customer
    time-to-value.
  - Mentor junior engineers and define best practices for
    deploying Agentic AI in regulated industries.
  - Provide internal technical leadership on scalable AI
    architecture and deployment standards.
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  - 7+ years of experience in AI/ML engineering.
  - 3+ years deploying AI solutions within healthcare or other
    regulated industries.
  - Proven experience designing and deploying LLM architectures,
    including fine-tuning and advanced prompt engineering.
  - Hands-on experience with voice automation systems (IVR, ASR,
    TTS).
  - Experience integrating AI systems with enterprise platforms
    such as EHRs, CRMs, and contact centers.
  - Strong Python expertise and experience with ML frameworks
    such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face.
  - Experience deploying AI solutions in cloud-native
    environments (AWS, GCP, or Azure).
  - Strong understanding of secure system design and data
    privacy principles.
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Experience building AI agents capable of autonomous, multi-
    step workflows.
  - Deep knowledge of healthcare interoperability standards
    (FHIR, HL7).
  - Experience working with vector databases and semantic search
    architectures.
  - Familiarity with FDA software guidance (SaMD).
  - Background in conversational analytics and customer
    experience optimization.
  - Experience contributing to reusable AI frameworks that
    support low-code/no-code platforms.
  - Proven track record of delivering production-grade AI
    systems in high-compliance environments.
