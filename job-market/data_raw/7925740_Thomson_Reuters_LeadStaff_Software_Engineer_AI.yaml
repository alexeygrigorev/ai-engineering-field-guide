  Lead/Staff Software Engineer, AI
  
  Are you ready to shape the future of AI‑driven tax
  automation? We're looking for a Senior AI Engineer to build
  and scale intelligent workflows using modern LLM/ML tooling.
  Your work will directly impact how tax professionals
  automate complex, high‑stakes processes and access critical
  information.
  
  You'll join our Tax and Accounting Professionals 1040 Scan
  product engineering team and own the design, implementation,
  and optimization of AI‑powered tax workflows—from data
  ingestion to production deployment.
  
  1040SCAN is the market-leading scan-and-populate engine in
  the 1040 workflow, organizing workpapers, extracting data,
  and exporting to tax software at scale. As a Senior AI
  engineer, you will modernize the AI that powers document
  understanding, extraction, and verification—expanding
  coverage and accuracy while reducing human effort.
  
  About the role,
  
  As a Lead/Staff Software Engineer AI, you will:
  
  - Advance document intelligence: Build generalizable models
    for tax documents (standard and non‑standard) using
    CV/NLP/LLMs and embeddings to move beyond fixed OCR
    templates with dynamic, context‑aware parsing.
  - Boost auto‑verification & quality: Improve
    native‑PDF/text‑layer matching, anomaly detection, and
    prior‑year‑aware checks to catch issues before human
    review; design human‑in‑the‑loop flows that preserve
    practitioner control.
  - Scale the pipeline: Productionize low‑latency
    training/inference pipelines over millions of documents
    with robust observability, evaluation, and drift
    monitoring.
  - Integrate LLMs and traditional ML models into robust,
    auditable workflows that support tax determination,
    document processing, and rules‑based automation.
  - Build and maintain data pipelines, feature extraction, and
    preprocessing for tax‑relevant data (e.g., invoices,
    filings, transactional data).
  - Develop and integrate RESTful APIs / microservices to expose
    AI capabilities to internal and external systems.
  - Ensure solutions meet compliance, security, and auditability
    requirements typical of tax and regulated domains.
  - You’ll collaborate across SurePrep engineering and other
    Thomson Reuters product & engineering teams leveraging
    TR’s AI platforms including Materia and Additive to
    deliver reliable, auditable AI in production.
  
  About you
  
  You’re a fit for the role of Lead/Staff Software Engineer,
  AI if your background includes:
  
  - 5+ years in applied ML/AI (or 5+ with an advanced degree)
    delivering production systems in document AI/OCR/NLP or
    information extraction at scale.
  - Strong Python and deep learning expertise
    (PyTorch/TensorFlow), with experience in LLMs,
    embeddings/vector search, prompt design/evaluation, and
    statistical methods for quality and uncertainty.
  - Cloud‑native ML ops experience: training/inference
    pipelines, feature/data stores, observability, cost/perf
    optimization.
  - Own end‑to‑end lifecycle for AI features: design →
    implementation → testing → deployment → monitoring →
    iteration.
  - Optimize model/workflow inference for latency, throughput,
    and cost, including caching, batching, and model selection
    strategies.
  - Implement monitoring, logging, tracing, and alerting for
    workflows and models in production (data drift, model
    performance, error rates).
  - Debug and troubleshoot complex AI systems in production,
    including prompt failures, integration bugs, and data
    quality issues.
  - Partner with Product, Tax SMEs, and other engineering teams
    to translate business/tax requirements into AI workflows.
  - Collaborate with data scientists and ML engineers on model
    selection, evaluation, and experimentation within Reducto
    pipelines.
  - Lead design reviews, perform code reviews, and mentor
    mid‑level/junior engineers on AI best practices and
    production‑grade coding.
  - Contribute to internal standards, best practices, and
    templates for building AI workflows with Reducto.
  - You've built end‑to‑end AI features that are running in
    production, not just prototypes.
  - You can take a vague tax/business requirement and turn it
    into a concrete, testable workflow design.
  - You care about robustness and correctness as much as
    cleverness—especially in domains where errors have
    financial or compliance impact.
  - You're comfortable reading tax/business rules and working
    with domain experts, even if you're not a tax specialist
    yourself.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Document AI background: layout parsing, table extraction,
    doc‑type classification, native‑PDF matching, and
    verification automation.
  - Agentic/LLM orchestration experience: familiarity with TR AI
    platforms such as Materia and Additive;
    retrieval‑augmented and tool‑use patterns; evaluation and
    guardrails.
  - Modern Development Practices: Hands-on with modern AI coding
    assistants including Claude Code, Cline, and GitHub
    Copilot for rapid prototyping, code generation, and
    workflow automation.
  - Version control: Experience with version control (Git),
    testing frameworks (pytest or similar), and modern DevOps
    practices.
  - Software Engineering: Familiarity with C#, Java or any other
    programming language
  - Domain familiarity: exposure to tax/financial document
    workflows or other regulated content systems is a plus.
