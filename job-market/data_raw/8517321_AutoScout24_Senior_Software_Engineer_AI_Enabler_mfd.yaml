description: |
  A career driven by you. At LeasingMarkt.de, we bring
  customers and dealers together to make car leasing more
  accessible, transparent, and efficient. With over 1,000
  partner dealerships and nearly 2 million users across the
  DACH region and the Netherlands, we’ve become Germany’s #1
  leasing platform. To keep growing and driving innovation in
  the mobility space, we’re looking for a Senior Software
  Engineer to join our high-performance team at our Düsseldorf
  office.
  
  As a Senior Software Engineer, you will play a key role in
  designing and developing robust, scalable applications that
  power one of the largest automotive leasing marketplaces in
  Europe. You’ll collaborate with a cross-functional team to
  build and evolve solutions that are architecturally sound,
  easy to maintain, and built for long-term impact. You’ll
  help shape technical direction while raising the bar for
  software quality and stability across the platform.
  
  What you’ll do:
  
  - Join one of our builders’ teams to build great products
    loved by our customers.
  - Apply an AI-first mindset to every phase of you-build-it-
    you-run-it: from design and coding to testing, deployment
    and operations.
  - Work hands-on in real product codebases (for example
    TypeScript/Node/Next.js or Java/Spring), using GenAI tools
    to accelerate development, improve quality and simplify
    existing systems.
  - Build and evolve AI-powered internal tools and workflows
    (assistants for coding, reviews, documentation, testing)
    that engineers across AutoScout24 can rely on every day.
  - Act as a multiplier and culture driver: coach teams on
    effective GenAI usage, share patterns and anti-patterns,
    and help establish AI-first ways of working across our
    engineering organization.
  - Experiment, measure and improve: run small, data-informed
    experiments with teams, learn what works in our context,
    and turn successful approaches into repeatable standards
    and playbooks.
  
  What you’ll bring:
  
  - Experience leveraging AI and Generative AI (GenAI) to
    enhance engineering productivity — including code
    generation, debugging, reviews, documentation, and
    decision support — with a proactive mindset toward
    adopting tools that streamline development and drive
    innovation.
  - Deep, hands-on experience building production systems (we
    expect you’ve spent at least 5 years doing this, possibly
    much more), ideally with PHP and Laravel as well as
    TypeScript/Node.js/Next.js on AWS, Azure or GCP.
  - Demonstrated personal excellence in using GenAI coding tools
    (for example GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude Code, Cursor,
    OpenAI Codex) to significantly improve your own
    development speed and quality: code generation,
    refactoring, debugging, tests and documentation.
  - Experience integrating LLM APIs (such as OpenAI, Anthropic,
    Azure OpenAI, Vertex AI or similar) into applications or
    internal tools.
  - Strong communication and influencing skills: you can
    introduce new tools and practices, align stakeholders,
    handle skepticism and iterate based on feedback.
  - A curious, growth-oriented mindset: you actively seek out
    new practices and tools, you are comfortable learning in
    public, and you help others do the same.
  - A pragmatic view of GenAI: you understand its limitations
    and risks and know how to put guardrails in place
    (reviews, tests, policies) to keep usage safe, compliant
    and sustainable at scale.
  - Experience with performance optimization, caching
    strategies, and system observability is a plus.
  
  A culture of growth
  
  With over 50 nationalities represented, we’re proud to
  welcome people of all backgrounds to our growing community,
  and we’re always finding new ways to help people feel
  welcomed and included. Here, you’ll have the tools, training
  and support you need to work in a way that suits you, learn
  new skills and reach your potential.
  
  For a career where you can drive our business and shape your
  future, apply now.
