  500M+ downloads. 80M+ monthly users. A decade of building –
  and we’re still accelerating.
  
  Flo is the world’s #1 health & fitness app worldwide on a
  mission to build a better future for female health. Backed
  by a $200M investment led by General Atlantic, we became the
  first product of our kind to reach a $1B valuation in 2024 –
  and we’re not slowing down.
  
  With 7M paid subscribers and the highest-rated experience in
  the App Store’s health category, we’ve spent 10 years
  earning trust at scale. Now, we’re building the next
  generation of digital health – AI-powered, privacy-first,
  clinically backed – to help our users know their body
  better.
  
  The job
  
  Join the AI Platform team as we build the backbone of Flo’s
  personalization.
  
  We are looking for an Backend Engineer to own the User
  Profile service—a high-scale system (20k RPS, <15ms latency)
  that powers experimentation and AI for 80M+ users. In this
  role, you will drive the development of User Profile 2.0,
  bridging the gap between raw user data and advanced ML
  feature stores.
  
  You will operate in a hybrid model: building core
  capabilities for AI/ML data representations while governing
  an inner-source ecosystem that allows other teams to
  contribute safely. If you are passionate about high-
  concurrency systems and enabling AI at scale, we want to
  hear from you!
  
  What you'll be doing:
  
  - Develop new features for the User Profile service – the
    central platform that powers personalization,
    experimentation, and AI features including Flo
    Conversational AI
  - Build User Profile 2.0 capabilities including historical
    data arrays, AI-ready attribute representations, and
    integration with ML feature stores
  - Design and implement data pipelines that deliver user
    attributes to AI/ML systems for personalized content
    generation and predictive models
  - Enable inner-source contributions: establish contribution
    guidelines, quality gates, and architectural standards for
    product teams
  - Review and approve pull requests from contributing teams,
    providing mentorship and ensuring code quality
  - Maintain architectural oversight of core components while
    enabling safe, autonomous contributions from product teams
  - Build and maintain attribute governance frameworks,
    cataloguing systems, and documentation standards
  - Ensure compliance with healthcare regulations (HIPAA, SOC 2,
    GDPR) and implement privacy-first design patterns
  - Participate in on-call rotation and drive incident response
    for this critical platform service
  - Work in a cross-functional setup alongside other engineering
    teams (Backend, ML, QA), product, and analytics teams
  
  Your ExperienceMust have:
  
  - 7+ years of professional experience building distributed
    backend systems at scale
  - Fluency in Scala, Java, or Python – with willingness to work
    primarily in Scala (we'll support your ramp-up if needed)
  - Deep experience with AWS services, particularly DynamoDB,
    EKS, and serverless architectures
  - Strong understanding of observability – logging, metrics,
    tracing, and alerting – and how to use it to drive
    operational excellence
  - Experience building high-throughput, low-latency APIs
    serving millions of users
  - Solid understanding of databases (SQL and NoSQL) and
    experience designing APIs that prioritise reliability and
    performance
  - Experience with code review, mentorship, and establishing
    engineering standards across teams
  - Track record of writing clean, documented, version-
    controlled code
  - Ownership mentality – you take initiative, don't wait to be
    told, and see problems through to resolution
  - Strong communication skills – you can collaborate
    effectively with multiple teams and explain technical
    decisions clearly
  
  Nice to have:
  
  - Experience with ML infrastructure, feature stores, or data
    platforms that serve AI/ML workloads
  - Familiarity with data pipelines and integration patterns for
    machine learning systems
  - Experience with inner-source or open-source contribution
    models and governance
  - Experience with platform/infrastructure teams supporting
    multiple product teams
  - Healthcare compliance framework experience (HIPAA, SOC 2,
    GDPR)
  - Feature flagging, A/B testing, or experimentation platform
    experience
  - Experience in the MedTech or HealthTech domain
  - Experience at a Tier-1 product company or related experience
    working within a product organisation
  
  How we work
  
  We’re a mission-led, product-driven team. We move fast, stay
  focused and take ownership – from brief to build to impact.
  Debate is encouraged. Decisions are shared. We care about
  craft, ship with purpose, and always raise the bar.
  
  You’ll be working with people who take their work seriously,
  not themselves. It takes commitment, resilience, and the
  drive to keep going when things get tough. Because better
  health outcomes are worth it.
  
  What you'll get
  
  We support impact with meaningful reward. Here’s what that
  looks like:
  
  - Competitive salary and annual reviews
  - Opportunity to participate in Flo’s performance incentive
    scheme
  - Paid holiday, sick leave, and female health leave
  - Enhanced parental leave and pay for maternity, paternity,
    same-sex and adoptive parents
  - Accelerated professional growth through world-changing work
    and learning support
  - In-person collaboration and work in a hybrid model, with 3
    days per week spent in the office
  - 5-week fully paid sabbatical at 5-year Floversary
  - Flo Premium for friends & family, plus more health, pension
    and wellbeing perks
  
  Diversity, equity and inclusion
  
  Our strength is in our differences. At Flo, hiring is based
  on merit, skill and what you bring to the role – nothing
  else. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer, and
  we welcome applicants from all backgrounds, communities and
  identities. Read our privacy notice for job applicants.
