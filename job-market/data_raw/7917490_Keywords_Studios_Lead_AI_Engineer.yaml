    pipelines
  
  The team includes Backend Engineers, Full-stack Developers,
  ML Engineers, Data Scientists, and Frontend
  Developers—collaborating to deliver intelligent and scalable
  AI experiences.
  
  About the role:
  
  We are looking for an experienced engineer with deep
  technical expertise in AI and strong leadership skills. You
  will help design and deliver advanced AI products and AI
  Agents, lead a group of engineers, and drive end-to-end
  execution of LLM-powered initiatives.
  
  This role combines hands-on AI/ML and LLM engineering with
  technical leadership—guiding backend, frontend, and full-
  stack developers to build reliable, scalable production AI
  systems.
  
  Requirements
  
  What you'll do:
  
  - Lead and mentor a team of backend and frontend developers,
    fostering a high-performing, collaborative engineering
    culture.
  - Own the technical direction, architecture, and strategy for
    LLM, AI Agent, and ML initiatives.
  - Architect and build AI Agents, RAG pipelines (including
    multimodal RAG), LLM-based services, and evaluation
    frameworks.
  - Design, build, and deploy scalable AI/ML systems from
    concept to production.
  - Collaborate closely with PMs, ML Engineers, and Data
    Scientists to convert business requirements into AI-driven
    solutions.
  - Oversee full SDLC for your squad—ensuring strong engineering
    practices around coding, testing, quality, and
    reliability.
  - Conduct detailed technical reviews and provide guidance to
    maintain code quality.
  - Troubleshoot performance, scalability, and reliability
    issues in production AI systems.
  - Champion continuous improvement, automation, and innovation
    within the team.
  
  - Keep the team up-to-date with advances in LLMs, LLMOps,
    fine-tuning techniques, vector search, and generative AI.
  
  What you'll bring:
  
  - 8–10 years of experience in software development.
  - More than 5 years of hands-on experience in AI/ML.
  - More than 2 years in an engineering leadership role,
    preferably leading a cross-functional team.
  - Hands-on experience building:
  - Strong understanding of ML algorithms, embeddings,
    transformers, vector semantics, and distributed systems.
  - Experience with Vector Databases such as Elasticsearch,
    Weaviate, Pinecone, or Milvus.
  - Proficiency with ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-
    learn).
  - Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) and MLOps
    tooling.
  
  Good to have:
  
  - Solid foundation in backend technologies such as Python,
    Java, Go, Node.js, and experience with Kafka.
  - Knowledge of the Gaming industry or Customer Support domain.
  - Familiarity with frontend frameworks (React, Angular,
    Vue.js).
  - Exposure to functional programming (Clojure preferred; our
    team uses Clojure).
  - Experience in startup/high-growth environments.
  - Open-source contributions in AI/ML/LLM projects.
  - Experience with containerization and orchestration (Docker,
    Kubernetes).
  
  Bonus Points:
  
  - Experience building production-grade LLM-powered automation
    for customer support or gaming.
  - Publications, presentations, or contributions related to
    LLMs, RAG, or AI Agents.
