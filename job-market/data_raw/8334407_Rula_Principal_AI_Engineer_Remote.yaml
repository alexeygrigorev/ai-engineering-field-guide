description: |
  We believe that mental health is just as important as
  physical health. We recognize that mental health issues can
  be complex and multifaceted, and we are dedicated to
  treating the whole person, not just the symptoms.
  
  We aim to create a world where mental health is no longer
  stigmatized or marginalized, but rather is embraced as an
  integral part of one's overall well-being.
  
  We believe that by providing quality care that is both
  evidence-based and compassionate, we can empower individuals
  to take charge of their mental health and achieve their full
  potential. We are passionate about making a positive impact
  on the lives of those struggling with mental health issues
  and we strive to be a force for positive change in the field
  of mental healthcare.
  
  Rula is a remote-first company. We currently hire in most
  U.S. states, with the exception of Hawaii.
  
  About the Role
  
  At Rula, this role owns the AI foundation that determines
  how, and how well, AI shows up across mental healthcare. The
  focus isn’t on prototypes or isolated features, but on
  building durable, production-grade generative AI systems
  that directly power patient engagement, provider workflows,
  and clinical operations at scale.
  
  You’ll operate where architecture, applied research, and
  real-world constraints meet. The work includes designing
  core AI platforms, setting technical standards for safety,
  reliability, and performance, and making principald
  decisions about how advanced AI is introduced into a
  regulated, high-stakes care environment. The goal is simple
  but hard: make AI genuinely useful in clinical contexts,
  without compromising trust or outcomes.
  
  This is a deeply hands-on role with real technical
  ownership. You’ll define system architecture, unblock
  complex engineering problems, and act as a technical
  multiplier for other engineers working across product
  surfaces. Success here means creating foundations that
  others can build on confidently and that hold up under
  scale, scrutiny, and real patient impact.
  
  The opportunity is less about chasing the frontier for its
  own sake and more about shaping how AI responsibly becomes
  part of everyday mental healthcare, setting direction not
  just for what we build next, but for how AI evolves inside
  the care ecosystem over time.
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  - 10+ years of software engineering, including 7+ years of
    experience with Public Cloud (AWS, GCP, etc.), 5+ years
    designing and scaling distributed systems.
  - 5+ years of deep experience in Python and at least one
    backend language (preferably JavaScript, TypeScript, Java,
    or Go)
  - 2+ years of proven track record building AI-powered products
    at scale, including hands-on experience with foundation
    models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Gemini, etc.).
  - 2+ years of strong experience in LLM integration patterns
    (RAG, function calling, agents, memory routing, etc.), or
    AI orchestration frameworks (eg. LangChain, LlamaIndex,
    DSPy, Haystack), or vector databases (eg. Pinecone,
    Weaviate, FAISS, Milvus).
  - 3+ years in working with MLOps, data pipelines, evaluation,
    and observability systems for continuous model
    improvement.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Experience architecting secure and compliant AI solutions in
    regulated environments (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).
  - Familiarity with human-in-the-loop systems and clinical
    decision support frameworks.
  - Experience designing evaluation pipelines for human
    alignment, factual accuracy, or model interpretability.
  - Contributions to open-source AI frameworks or applied
    research in NLP, healthcare AI, or GenAI safety.
  - Experience contributing to early-stage team growth (0 → 1)
  - Experience leading or mentoring engineering teams in AI, ML
    platform, or applied research domains.

  full-time employees receive:
  
  - 100% remote work environment: Working hours to support a
