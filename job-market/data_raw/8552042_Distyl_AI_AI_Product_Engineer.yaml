  About Distyl AI
  
  Distyl AI develops production-grade AI systems to power core
  operational workflows for Fortune 500 companies. Powered by
  a strategic partnership with OpenAI, in-house software
  accelerators, and deep enterprise AI expertise, we deliver
  working AI systems with rapid time to value – within a
  quarter.
  
  Our products have helped Fortune 500 customers across
  diverse industries, from insurance and CPG to non-profits.
  As part of our team, you will help companies identify,
  build, and realize value from their GenAI investments, often
  for the first time. We are customer-centric, working
  backward from the customer’s problem and holding ourselves
  accountable for creating both financial impact and improving
  the lives of end-users.
  
  Distyl is led by proven leaders from top companies like
  Palantir and Apple and is backed by Lightspeed, Khosla,
  Coatue, Dell Technologies Capital, Nat Friedman (Former CEO
  of GitHub), Brad Gerstner (Founder and CEO of Altimeter),
  and board members of over a dozen Fortune 500 companies.
  
  What We Are Looking For
  
  At Distyl, AI Product Engineers build the user-facing
  applications and workflows through which humans interact
  with, guide, and improve AI systems. This role is for
  engineers who care deeply about how intelligent systems
  behave in practice—and believe that great AI systems are
  shaped as much by their interfaces, feedback loops, and
  workflows as by their underlying models.
  
  AI Product Engineers are hands-on builders who work at the
  intersection of engineering, product, and applied AI. They
  partner closely with AI Strategists, Forward Deployed AI
  Engineers, and customers to translate business objectives,
  domain expertise, and user needs into concrete product
  experiences that make AI systems more effective over time.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Own the design and implementation of user-facing
    applications that sit directly on top of AI systems
  - Build interfaces and workflows for knowledge capture, system
    configuration, evaluation, and feedback, ensuring that
    user interactions are tightly coupled to underlying
    models, data, and evaluation pipelines
  - Accountable for whether human interactions with AI systems
    produce high-quality signal that measurably improves
    system behavior over time
  - Partner with AI Strategists to understand customer goals,
    domain constraints, and success metrics, and to turn those
    inputs into executable product designs
  - Help shape how domain knowledge and business intent are
    encoded into workflows, schemas, and interfaces that AI
    systems can reliably learn from
  - Work across the full stack—front end, back end, and data—to
    deliver cohesive product experiences. This includes
    designing APIs and data models, building services that
    connect user actions to system behavior, and ensuring that
    captured feedback can be queried, analyzed, and acted on
    effectively
  - Study how humans and AI systems interact in real workflows,
    identifying where interfaces clarify intent, where they
    introduce noise, and how design choices affect system
    performance and trust
  - Iterate quickly in production, using real user behavior and
    system outcomes to refine both the product experience and
    the AI systems it supports
  - Ownership of shipped product experiences and adapt them as
    customer needs, business objectives, and AI capabilities
    evolve
  
  What We Require
  
  - 1+ years of experience of software engineering experience
  - Strong Full-Stack Engineering Skills: Comfortable building
    across front end (TypeScript/React), back end (Python),
    and data layers. You can move quickly from prototype to
    production, and you understand how to design systems that
    are reliable, maintainable, and easy to evolve
  - Experience Building Products on Top of AI Systems: Shipped
    user-facing applications that integrate with LLMs or other
    AI services. You understand how interface design, data
    modeling, and workflow structure influence AI behavior,
    evaluation quality, and system improvement over time
  - Comfort Operating at the Product–Engineering Boundary: Enjoy
    working with AI Strategists and domain experts to
    translate ambiguous business goals into concrete,
    buildable product workflows. You can reason about
    tradeoffs between user experience, system constraints, and
    delivery timelines without needing a separate product
    manager in the loop
  - Systems Thinking Across Human and AI Boundaries: Reason
    clearly about how user actions become structured signal
    for AI systems. You care about how feedback is captured,
    how knowledge is represented, and how product decisions
    affect downstream system performance and trust
  - AI-Native Working Style: Use AI tools daily to write and
    debug code, explore designs, analyze data, and automate
    repetitive work. You actively experiment with new
    capabilities and incorporate them into how you build and
    iterate on products
  - Travel: Ability to travel 10-20%
  
  What We Offer
  
  - The base salary range for this role is $130K – $250K,
    depending on experience, location, and level. In addition
    to base compensation, this role is eligible for meaningful
    equity, along with a comprehensive benefits package
  - 100% covered medical, dental, and vision for employees and
    dependents
  - 401(k) with additional perks (e.g., commuter benefits,
    in‑office lunch)
  - Access to state‑of‑the‑art models, generous usage of modern
    AI tools, and real‑world business problems
  - Ownership of high‑impact projects across top enterprises
  - A mission‑driven, fast‑moving culture that prizes curiosity,
    pragmatism, and excellence
  
  Distyl has offices in San Francisco and New York. This role
  follows a hybrid collaboration model with 3+ days per week
  (Tuesday–Thursday) in‑office.
  
  We’re grateful for the strong interest in this role. The
  best way to get your profile in front of our team is to
  apply directly through our careers page, where all
  applications are reviewed. Due to the high volume of
  interest, we’re not able to review or respond to all direct
  emails or LinkedIn messages. We will be in touch with every
  applicant once we’ve completed our review, regardless of the
  decision.
