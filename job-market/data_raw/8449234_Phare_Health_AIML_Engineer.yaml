  About Us
  
  Phare Health is now part of R1 and its AI innovation engine,
  R37 Lab, bringing Phare’s frontier clinical reasoning
  technology together with one of the largest healthcare
  platforms in the U.S.
  
  At R37 and Phare, we are building the first AI-native
  Healthcare Revenue Operating System: a connected platform
  that reasons over full medical records, payer logic, and
  financial workflows to automate medical coding, billing, and
  follow-up.
  
  Backed by real customers, real data, and real distribution,
  we operate on a national scale. Our agentic AI systems
  already power production workflows across 95 of the top 100
  U.S. health systems, processing hundreds of millions of
  patient encounters each year, including:
  
  - 180M+ Claims
  - 550M+ Patient encounters
  - 1.2B+ Workflow actions and outcomes each year
  
  This is startup-level ownership with enterprise-level
  impact. If you want to build AI that ships, scales, and
  measurably improves how healthcare works, this is the place
  to do it.
  
  The Role
  
  As an AI/ML Engineer, you’ll lead the development of early-
  phase, high-impact AI/ML systems; own the internal ML dev
  environment (instrumentation, benchmarking,
  experimentation); and help bring scientific rigor into
  production environments, so ideas move rapidly from research
  to validated pipelines.
  
  You’ll partner closely with Research Scientists to make
  models production-ready with clear handoff contracts,
  performance gates, and packaging standards; and with ML
  Platform & Ops for safe rollouts.
  
  We are hiring across several seniority levels ranging from
  Mid-level up to Staff. At a minimum, we would expect 5 years
  of software engineering experience with 2 years of AI/ML
  experience.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Build training and inference infrastructure for a fast-
    moving research team, including experiment tracking and
    benchmarking
  - Design and develop scalable AI systems for retrieval,
    ranking, categorization, and generative AI over large-
    scale unstructured healthcare data
  - Design, build, and operate AI/ML Systems end-to-end: from
    problem framing and model selection to production build
    and deployment, to ongoing improvement
  - Work backwards from complex business problems to define AI
    abstractions and system architectures that are scalable,
    explainable, and maintainable
  - Bring rigor to scientific decisions by defining the right
    evaluation datasets, metrics, and validation strategies
    tied to real outcomes
  - Design ranking and triage models that determine how work is
    routed between AI agents and human operators
  - Establish feedback loops and data flywheels that
    continuously improve model performance in production
  - Partner closely with software engineers, product managers,
    clinicians, and operators to ensure AI/ML systems deliver
    measurable business value
  - Prototype and scale new AI capabilities from 0 → 1, then
    harden them for real-world production use
  - Mentor other AI/ML engineers and promote best practices
    across modeling, evaluation, and deployment
  
  Role Leveling
  
  We are looking for candidates at various levels with this
  type of experience, ranging from L2 (Mid-level) to L4
  (Staff).
  
  - L2: Independently delivers a complete end-to-end project,
    owning design, implementation, and delivery of scoped work
  - L3: Leads delivery of larger projects, handling increased
    technical complexity and ambiguity, providing light
    guidance to L2s on shared work
  - L4: Leads teams or major cross-functional initiatives while
    managing a portfolio of projects aligned to key technical
    goals
  
  Benefits
  
  - Top-of-market compensation (salary + equity)
  - Flexible PTO
  - Comprehensive health benefits
  - 401(k) matching
  - Inspiring, brilliant, mission-driven teammates
  
  Hiring Flow
  
  - Intro call - your background & our mission alignment
  - Technical deep-dives - pseudo-coding exercise and systems
    design (not Leetcode)
  - Final in-person interview at one of our hubs (SF, NYC,
    Austin, or Chicago; travel arranged)
