  We are looking for an experienced Principal Software
  Engineer (Fullstack, AI) to join the Learner Experience
  Cluster at Babbel and help shape the technology behind
  impactful, customer-facing learning experiences used by
  millions of learners worldwide.
  
  A Principal Software Engineer at Babbel drives outsized,
  durable impact across multiple teams by shaping technical
  direction, improving system-level outcomes, and scaling the
  effectiveness of others. This is a role defined by
  influence, planning, and strong role modeling — not
  authority or heroics.
  
  As a Principal Software Engineer in the Learner Experience
  Cluster, you operate at the intersection of deep technical
  judgment, product thinking, and organizational impact. You
  care deeply about how technology enables learning outcomes —
  and you bring the architectural range to keep complex,
  customer-facing systems coherent as they grow.
  
  You are also fluent in AI-native engineering workflows and
  motivated to evolve how your teams leverage AI across the
  software development lifecycle. You combine fullstack
  excellence with pragmatic, metrics-driven judgment about
  where AI creates real value — and you model that judgment
  for others.
  
  Your impact is visible across teams, sustained over time,
  and focused on delivery speed, reliability, developer
  productivity, and learner experience.
  
  What success looks like:
  
  - Engineers across the cluster are measurably more effective —
    faster at design, implementation, and review — because of
    standards, patterns, and enablement you drove.
  - AI is integrated into engineering workflows in ways that are
    practical, evaluated, and repeatable — not experimental
    noise.
  - Key architectural decisions affecting multiple teams have
    clear rationale, documented trade-offs, and visible
    adoption.
  - At least one senior engineer in the cluster grew in scope or
    capability as a direct result of your mentorship or
    technical leadership.
  
  You will:
  
  - Drive architectural coherence and technical direction across
    multiple customer-facing systems and teams.
  - Design and evolve high-leverage APIs, data models, and
    distributed systems that power learner journeys,
    personalization, and experimentation.
  - Establish shared patterns, abstractions, and standards that
    reduce fragmentation and increase engineering leverage.
  - Act as a role model for AI-native workflows across design,
    coding, testing, code review, debugging, and incident
    response.
  - Champion effective and responsible usage of AI-assisted
    development tools and scalable prompting practices.
  - Identify and implement opportunities where AI can measurably
    improve developer productivity, delivery speed, and
    production quality.
  - Define guardrails and evaluation approaches to ensure AI
    usage is secure, reliable, and aligned with engineering
    standards.
  - Improve delivery performance by advancing continuous
    delivery, observability, and production excellence
    practices.
  - Anticipate cross-team risks and dependencies early and
    proactively de-risk them to protect learner experience and
    commitments.
  - Multiply your impact through mentoring senior engineers,
    influencing without authority, and stepping in hands-on
    when critical paths require it.
  
  You have:
  
  - Extensive experience designing, building, and operating
    distributed systems using Typescript and AWS.
  - Deep expertise in APIs, asynchronous systems, data modeling,
    and service-to-service communication in production
    environments.
  - Strong architectural judgment and the ability to communicate
    trade-offs clearly in service of product and learner
    outcomes.
  - Proven ability to improve system-level outcomes such as
    reliability, scalability, delivery speed, and operational
    excellence.
  - Hands-on fluency with AI-assisted development tools and
    demonstrated integration of AI into daily engineering
    workflows.
  - Experience experimenting with or building AI-powered
    systems, LLM integrations, or AI-enabled features.
  - Pragmatic, metrics-driven judgment in evaluating where AI
    adds meaningful value versus where traditional approaches
    are superior.
  - A track record of influencing technical direction across
    multiple teams without relying on formal authority.
  - Strong product mindset with experience connecting technical
    decisions to experimentation and measurable customer
    impact.
  - Demonstrated ability to mentor senior engineers, raise
    technical standards, and elevate AI fluency across an
    organization.
  
  Nice to have:
  
  - Experience with LLM evaluation frameworks, prompt
    engineering at scale, retrieval-augmented generation
    (RAG), or model experimentation pipelines.
  - Experience building or scaling learning platforms,
    personalization systems, or A/B experimentation
    frameworks.
  - Exposure to domain-driven design, event-driven
    architectures, or platform engineering.
  - Experience shaping engineering operating models or standards
    during periods of technological transformation.
  - Genuine interest in how AI, product, and learning science
    can combine to create meaningful learner outcomes.
  - Experience with Golang.
  
  Please note that our company’s operating language is
  English, so you will need to be able to work in English.
  
  Some perks of becoming a Babbelonian:
  
  - Enjoy 30 vacation days and the chance to take a 3-month
    Sabbatical. Plus family and life situation counseling.
  - Decide how, when and from where you want to work with our
    flexible working hours and remote-friendly options as
    Jobbatical (up to 3 months inside the EU and UK) or work
    from our fully equipped office with nap, faith and family
    rooms.
  - Learn and grow with the internal learning opportunities, and
    use a yearly learning & development budget for external
    training. Learn languages with Babbel for free with your
    full access to Babbel & Babbel Live classes.
  - Take advantage of your mobility benefits options and a
    discounted Urban Sports Club membership.
  - Be part of our employee communities (such as FLINTA, DE&I
    Ambassadors and LGBTQIA groups), attend cultural and
    regular social events.
