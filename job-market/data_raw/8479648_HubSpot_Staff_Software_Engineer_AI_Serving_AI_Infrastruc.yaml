  HubSpot is on the forefront of empowering businesses with
  cutting-edge AI, and our AI Infrastructure group is at the
  heart of this initiative. We are seeking a Staff level
  Software Engineer with a passion for infrastructure and
  developer experience to join our AI Serving team. The AI
  Serving team is part of AI Infrastructure and its goal is to
  own and operate HubSpot's model inference and serving
  infrastructure end-to-end, ensuring AI models are reliably
  deployed, scaled, observed, and cost-efficient across all
  hublets and environments, while also serving as the home for
  modern Python at HubSpot.
  
  The team owns the serving frameworks and libraries that
  power synchronous, asynchronous, and offline inference,
  along with model deployment pipelines, autoscaling, and
  GPU/CPU resource management. The team's roadmap focuses on
  improving the reliability and efficiency of batch inference,
  strengthening model observability, and scaling AI
  infrastructure cost-effectively. The team also serves as the
  home for core Python libraries and tooling across HubSpot.
  
  As a Staff Software Engineer on the AI Serving team you
  will:
  
  - Write and ship production code that directly powers AI
    capabilities across HubSpot, a crucial building block for
    user and business impact at scale
  - Lead the evolution of our model serving and inference
    infrastructure, improving reliability, scalability, and
    cost-efficiency
  - Set technical direction for how HubSpot deploys and operates
    ML models at scale, guiding decisions on architecture,
    cost optimization, and developer experience
  - Work closely with Machine Learning Engineers, Product
    Software Engineers, and other Infrastructure teams to
    streamline model deployment and serving
  - Gain deep exposure to a wide range of HubSpot infrastructure
    systems through building and maintaining core Python
    libraries, an excellent  opportunity to learn how HubSpot
    operates under the hood
  - Collaborate with HubSpotters all over the company, whether
    in engineering, product, design, research, marketing,
    sales, etc, gaining exposure to how HubSpot works as a
    business
  - Be empowered to show up as your authentic self and choose a
    work style and location where you can do your best work,
    whether that's at home, in an office, or a blend of the
    two
  
  We're not just looking for engineers with many years of
  experience. Instead we're looking for engineers who also
  have a track record of unique excellence, leadership, and
  leveling up those around them.
  
  We work with Python and Java primarily, but experience with
  specific technologies is secondary to strong programming
  fundamentals. Check out our engineering blog to learn more.
  
  What we'd like to see:
  
  - A proven track record of directly contributing to and
    leading infrastructure projects at scale, ideally in
    serving, deployment, or platform engineering
  - The ability to work collaboratively with the team to solve
    problems, transfer knowledge, and develop overall platform
    architecture
  - The ability to work effectively across teams, driving
    technical initiatives spanning multiple groups within AI
    Infrastructure and beyond
  - Comfort with ambiguity: you can take on broad, cross-team
    problems and drive them to resolution without waiting for
    every detail to be specified
  - Coaching and mentorship experience
  - A track record in partnering successfully with recruiting to
    build remarkable engineering teams
  - Bonus: Python expertise. Experience with Python tooling,
    libraries, and developer experience is a strong plus,
    given the team's role in stewarding Python across AI
    workloads at HubSpot
