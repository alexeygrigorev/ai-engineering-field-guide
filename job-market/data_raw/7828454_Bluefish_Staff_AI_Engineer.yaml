  About the Position
  
  As a Staff AI Engineer, you’ll serve as a technical leader
  for our LLM-powered products at the forefront of marketing
  and advertising technologies. You’ll own critical
  architectural decisions, set quality bars, and lead
  multi‑team initiatives that drive measurable outcomes.
  
  As our Staff AI Engineer, you will lead the vision and
  execution of our data platform and LLM-powered products.
  You’ll own critical architectural decisions across data
  pipelines, model integration, model deployment and evals:
  turning high-level product and business requirements into
  robust, scalable data products that drive measurable
  outcomes for our Fortune 500 customers. This role spans data
  backend and ML engineering: from the reliability and cost
  efficiency of our pipelines to the outcome and performance
  of LLM-enabled features. You’ll raise the bar for data
  literacy across the department, craft and collaboration.
  
  You’ll be accountable for the health, cost, and evolution of
  key data product and data platforms, partnering closely with
  full-stack engineers, product, design, and devops to deliver
  outcomes our customers can trust.
  
  This role presents an exciting opportunity to shape the
  future of AI-driven technologies and make meaningful
  contributions to real-world applications.
  
  The role is linked with our location in Berlin, but we are
  flexible about remote work in Germany.
  
  What You’ll Be Doing
  
  - Lead end-to-end architecture for data platforms and
    pipelines: scraping, data extraction, transformation,
    storage, serving, and ML/LLM integration, balancing
    performance, reliability, security, and cost.
  - Incrementally scale pipelines and systems: design safe
    rollout plans and north star data-quality metrics to
    handle customer and traffic growth without impacting
    production.
  - Translate business goals into actionable data products:
    assess high-level requirements, carve clear problem
    spaces, draft crisp RFCs, and sequence work into
    deliverable projects for the team.
  - Establish and enforce engineering standards: testing
    strategy, evals, observability, data contracts, and
    security practices across services. Think through short-
    term and long-term goals to come up with fast go-to-market
    products, while planning ahead for productization.
  - Up‑level the org: lead architecture reviews, codify
    patterns, mentor Senior Engineers, and multiply impact
    through documentation, code reviews, and pairing.
  - Startup‑ready: flexible, comfortable with ambiguity and
    constant change; proactive about process, documentation,
    and reliability without over‑engineering.
  - Lead the collaboration and define how AI engineers work
    cross-functionally with software engineers, devops,
    product managers and designers, to conceptualize and shape
    innovative and impactful solutions. Provide mentorship to
    junior team members and cultivate a culture of
    collaboration and innovation.
  - Ship meaningful experiments: prototype data/ML capabilities,
    evaluate feasibility and ROI, and make pragmatic calls on
    productionalizing with an eye on operating costs and risk.
  
  Qualifications
  
  - 8+ years building and operating production data systems,
    including leading cross-cutting architectural changes, and
    deploying LLMs in real‑world scenarios at scale.
  - Deep experience Python and modern service architectures;
    strong system design and data modeling fundamentals.
  - Extensive experience with training and deploying machine
    learning models, particularly within the NLP/LLM domain.
    Proficiency in Python. Familiarity with infrastructure as
    code, CI/CD, and cloud infrastructure.
  - Fluency in operational maturity: SLOs, on‑call/incident
    practices, and observability.
  - Strong analytical and problem-solving abilities, with a bias
    towards action and outcomes. Experience with data
    preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation
    techniques.
  - Excellent communication skills, with the ability to explain
    complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
    Demonstrated leadership experience, with the ability to
    guide and inspire a team.
  
  What We Offer
  
  - A dynamic role at the forefront of AI marketing technology
    with ample opportunities for personal and professional
    growth.
  - Unique opportunity to join on the ground floor of a fast-
    moving startup building at the center of AI.
  - Tackle challenging problems while disrupting the $300BN
    legacy martech industry.
  - Join an experienced team where you will have immediate
    ownership and impact.
  - Competitive salary and bonus appropriate for experience and
    company stage.
  - Significant equity package appropriate for company stage.
  - Wework co-working day-passes.
  - PTO and remote work flexibility.
