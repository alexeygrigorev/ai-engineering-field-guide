  About Netskope
  
  Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise
  than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to
  dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that
  is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever
  it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network
  and Data Security.
  
  Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security
  company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of
  employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis,
  Bangalore, London, Paris, Melbourne, Taipei, and Tokyo. Our
  core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we
  purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting
  spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration,
  and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations
  to employee recognition events and social professional
  groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we
  strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.  Visit
  us at Netskope Careers. Please follow us on LinkedIn and
  Twitter@Netskope.
  
  About the role:
  
  Please note, this team is hiring across all levels and
  candidates are individually assessed and appropriately
  leveled based upon their skills and experience.
  
  We are seeking an exceptional Staff Software Engineer to
  build next-generation security analytics and AI-powered
  capabilities within Netskope's platform. This is a high-
  impact individual contributor role for an engineer who
  excels at solving complex technical problems at the
  intersection of artificial intelligence, large-scale data
  systems, and cybersecurity.
  
  As a Staff Engineer, you will design and implement
  sophisticated systems that leverage cutting-edge AI/ML
  techniques, graph-based analytics, and real-time data
  processing to solve critical security challenges. You will
  work on problems spanning threat detection, risk assessment,
  behavioral analytics, and intelligent automation—building
  the systems that help security teams at the world's largest
  enterprises detect and respond to threats.
  
  This role requires deep technical expertise with strong
  hands-on implementation skills. You will collaborate closely
  with Distinguished Engineers, Senior engineers, Product
  managers, and security researchers to deliver production-
  quality solutions that operate at massive scale. Your code
  and architectural decisions will directly impact how
  thousands of organizations protect their critical assets.

  on Staff UI Developer to take ownership of the next
  generation of user experiences for our Agentic AI platform.
  You will drive the technical direction, ensure the
  scalability of the UI architecture, and set the bar for code
  quality. If you possess the technical depth of a developer,
  the foresight of an architect, and the proven ability to
  lead complex initiatives, we would like to speak with you
  about this exciting, impactful opportunity.

    necessary to optimize architecture and troubleshoot
    complex distributed issues.
  - Provide technical leadership and strategic direction for the
    overall Netskope UI and the API Gateway components
    interacting with the Agentic AI models.
  - Collaborate effectively across organizational boundaries
    (Product Management, Backend AI/ML teams) to ensure a
    shared roadmap and streamlined, end-to-end delivery of
    Agentic AI features.
  - Refine and grow existing processes, or develop new
    workflows, to enable the smooth and efficient functioning
    of the UI engineering team supporting the AI initiatives.
  - Collaborate with the geo-distributed team to own and deliver
    high-impact projects that connect the Agentic AI backend
    to the user interface, ensuring successful end-to-end
    deployment.
  - Collaborating with the geo-distributed team to own and
    deliver projects end-to-end.
  - Communicating across functional teams and driving
    engineering initiatives.

    sophisticated, large-scale web user interfaces.
  - Expert-level, hands-on experience building and architecting
    web UI applications using React, or similar modern
