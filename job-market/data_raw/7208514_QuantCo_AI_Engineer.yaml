description: |
  AI engineers at QuantCo build cutting-edge systems that
  bridge the gap between advances in frontier model technology
  and real-world impact in the world's foremost companies.
  They design, build, and implement applied AI systems that
  improve the quality of human decisions and unlock major
  efficiencies. AI engineers work with data scientists to
  solve complex problems in inference optimization, scalable
  systems design, and human-computer interaction. Team members
  may work in forward-deployed roles, collaborating directly
  with clients to discover, rapidly iterate on and deploy AI
  solutions, as well as in centralized roles that abstract
  successful solutions into scalable assets. Our team combines
  technical deep learning and engineering expertise with an
  entrepreneurial mindset driven by rapid experimentation,
  first-principles thinking, and a passion for tackling
  complex real-world problems to deliver lasting impact.
  
  Description
  
  You will design, test, and deploy AI systems that are
  embedded at scale. Operating at the intersection of machine
  learning and engineering, you will leverage cutting-edge
  models to build robust, production-ready AI applications.
  You will lead the design of data and inference pipelines,
  orchestrate the integration of LLM-based components such as
  retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and balance
  engineering constraints with business priorities. From
  system design to deployment, you will own all stages of
  product iteration and development, building solutions that
  seamlessly integrate into enterprise settings, designed to
  change the way our clients work with AI.
  
  Requirements
  
  - BSc, MSc or PhD in Computer Science, Engineering, Physics,
    or a related technical or STEM field from a leading
    university.
  - Experience working with relevant models and/ or
    architectures within the following fields: Computer
    Vision, Natural Language Processing, or Graph Neural
    Networks.
  - Experience writing production-ready code.
  - Experience programming in Python.
  - Familiarity with the frontier labs APIs (Gemini, OpenAI,
    Anthropic), and their advanced features like structured
    outputs and tool calling.
  - Understanding of LLM inference considerations e.g. input vs.
    output tokens, prompt caching.
  - Strong computer science fundamentals in areas such as data
    structures, cloud infrastructure, distributed systems,
    machine learning, and high-performance computing.
  - Experience and willingness to work through the challenges
    associated with large, unstructured, real-world data sets.
  - Ability to develop custom tooling for efficient
    experimentation and evaluation of LLM applications /
    agentic workflows
  
  What We Offer
  
  You will be part of a smart, motivated, and driven team that
  revels in working on challenging problems and finding novel
  solutions; values our customers and users; and strives to
