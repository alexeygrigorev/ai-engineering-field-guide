  About Toku
  
  Every company in the world runs payroll. But the rails
  underneath it haven’t changed since the 1970s.
  
  Toku is building what comes next - infrastructure that makes
  payroll work the way the internet does: instantly, globally,
  and without unnecessary friction.
  
  ‍
  
  We enable companies to pay teams in stablecoins, fiat, or
  tokens - without switching systems, retraining staff, or
  giving up compliance. With one API, Toku connects into
  platforms like ADP, Gusto, or Workday, and upgrades the back
  end to move money in seconds instead of days.
  
  We're building the future of payroll and we're just getting
  started.

  We are hiring a Senior Full-Stack Engineer who is deeply AI-
  native. This is not a traditional coding role. Our
  engineering workflow is agent-first, and we expect engineers
  to use AI as their primary interface for design,
  implementation, testing, refactoring, and delivery.
  
  Toku builds mission-critical software across payroll, token
  administration, and financial operations. We ship fast,
  operate with high ownership, and expect excellent
  engineering judgment.
  
  If agents have not significantly transformed the way you
  work, this role is not a fit.
  
  How We Build
  
  - Daily use of Claude and Codex across the full SDLC.
  - Agent-first execution; we do not expect handwritten code as
    the default path.
  - No token budget constraints for engineering workflows.
  - Strong emphasis on throughput, correctness, and review
    quality with AI-assisted development.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Build and ship full-stack features across frontend and
    backend systems.
  - Own work end-to-end: product requirements, architecture,
    implementation, testing, rollout, and monitoring.
  - Use AI agents to accelerate delivery while improving
    reliability and maintainability.
  - Partner closely with product, design, and operations to
    deliver high-impact outcomes quickly.
  - Improve internal engineering workflows for AI-native
    development and team leverage.
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - 5 to 7+ years of software engineering experience in
    production environments.
  - Strong full-stack skills (TypeScript/JavaScript, modern
    frontend frameworks, backend APIs, SQL/data modeling).
  - Clear track record of shipping customer-facing features and
    backend systems.
  - Heavy, practical, and proven daily use of AI coding agents.
  - Excellent prompt-to-production workflow: spec → agent loops
    → validation → deploy.
  - Strong testing discipline and ability to reason about
    failure modes.
  
  Non-Negotiables
  
  - You are a rampant user of AI tools for engineering work.
  - You are comfortable in an agent-first environment where
    handwritten code is not the default.
  - You believe AI agents have fundamentally changed how high-
    performing engineers work.
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Experience in fintech, payroll, payments, or crypto-enabled
    systems.
  - Experience with Next.js, Node.js, Prisma, and typed API
    patterns.
  - Experience improving developer productivity systems and AI-
    enabled engineering standards.
  
  Toku is an equal opportunity employer, and we are committed
  to being a diverse team that reflects a broad range of
  background, thought, and experience. We do not discriminate
  based on race, color, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual
  orientation, age, national origin, status as an individual
  with a disability, status as protected veteran, or any other
  legally protected characteristics. Women, minorities,
  LGBTQ+, and people from underrepresented backgrounds are
  strongly encouraged to apply.
  
  We strongly encourage you use Rezi.ai to vet resume quality
  before applying.
