  ✈️ About AirNxt
  
  AirNxt is building the next generation of AI-powered MRO
  software to transform aviation maintenance, operations, and
  management. Our platform is designed to be intuitive,
  scalable, and high-performance, simplifying complex
  workflows and enhancing efficiency across the aviation
  industry.
  
  As we scale, we’re looking for passionate professionals who
  thrive in agile environments and are eager to solve real-
  world aviation challenges using cutting-edge technology and
  innovative solutions. If that sounds like you, we’d love to
  hear from you!
  
  🎯 The Role
  
  This is not a research role, it’s a build-and-ship role. You
  will lead the design and implementation of AirNxt’s AI
  capabilities, from document understanding to agentic
  workflows and early fault prediction.
  
  You’ll partner closely with our CEO and Data Architect to
  define what “intelligent aviation software” actually means
  in practice.
  
  You will not be buried in infra or tooling. This role is
  about shipping AI systems that work in production, in the
  real world.
  
  🧠 What You'll Build:
  
  - Design and deploy AI workflows that turn raw maintenance
    documents into structured, validated data
  - Agent-based automation workflows using LangGraph (or
    equivalent), orchestrating validation, transformation, and
    human-in-loop approval
  - Develop lightweight predictive models based on time-series
    or log patterns that flag potential issues before they
    become unscheduled events
  - Implement NLP + LLM chains that extract meaning from
    technical and regulatory documents, pilot logs, work
    orders, and assist in summarizing or generating checklists
  - Build with clear traceability, fallbacks, and an execution
    path that earns trust from ops teams and regulators
  
  ⚙️ What You Bring
  
  You’ve likely done some or all of the following:
  
  - 4–8 years of experience building and shipping real-world
    AI/ML systems (not just prototypes or research)
  - Strong Python developer with ability to own services end-to-
    end
  - Hands-on with LLM workflows, prompt engineering, and
    chaining frameworks (LangGraph, LangChain, Haystack, or
    similar)
  - Integrated LLMs, embeddings, and vector search into real-
    world workflows
  - Designed custom NLP chains for document understanding, with
    schema enforcement and confidence scoring
  - Working knowledge of time-series or anomaly detection (e.g.,
    Prophet, LSTM, transformers)
  - High ownership mindset—you debug in production and think in
    first principles
  - Clear communicator who thrives in lean, fast-paced teams
    without layers of abstraction
  
  ✅ Bonus if you’ve touched:
  
  - Aviation, logistics, or other physical/regulated systems
  - Graph data (Neo4j, property graphs, entity relationships)
  - Safety reporting systems or compliance-heavy workflows
  - Smart-contracts or audit-proof data systems
  
  🧭 What Success Looks Like in 6 Months
  
  - You’ve built an intelligent pipeline that turns raw PDFs
    into structured, validated records
  - Agents are live, automating complex data flows with human
    oversight where needed
  - A predictive model flags early risk conditions based on
    real-world log and usage data
  - You’re the technical owner of our AI system, and a respected
    voice in the team
  - We're not guessing, your systems are improving speed,
    quality, and safety on the ground
  
  🎁 What We Offer
  
  - Competitive salary, Health insurance
  - The chance to own a core product stream from the start, and
    grow into Head of AI if that’s your path
  - Early access to problems that are hard, real, and high-
    impact
  - A team that moves fast, thinks clearly, and backs each other
  - A mission that matters: keep aircraft safer, smarter, and
    better maintained
  
  🚫 What We Don’t Offer
  
  - Endless sprints to nowhere
  - AI hype without grounding
  - Legacy drag, middle-management layers, or AI theater
  - Burnout-as-a-badge or chaos as culture
  
  If you’re a builder who codes, simplifies, and cares about
  execution, this is yours.
  
  We’re not looking for a perfect resume. We’re looking for
  the person who can build the system.
  
  If that’s you, let’s talk.
