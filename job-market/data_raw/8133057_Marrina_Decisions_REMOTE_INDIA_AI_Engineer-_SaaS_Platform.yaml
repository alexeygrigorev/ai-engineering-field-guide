  Role Overview
  
  We are looking for an AI Engineer to maintain and enhance
  the AI-driven backbone of the Sootra platform. This role
  involves ensuring production stability of LLM/VLM pipelines,
  optimizing model interactions, maintaining APIs and queues,
  and building feedback loops that continuously improve AI
  outputs.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Maintain and optimize LLM- and VLM-powered services for
    content generation, compliance scoring, and campaign
    testing.
  - Manage and scale Flask/FastAPI microservices, ensuring high
    uptime and low latency.
  - Maintain Dramatiq queues for async AI workflows, campaign
    generation, and pipeline orchestration.
  - Deploy, monitor, and debug Uvicorn/Gunicorn-based hosting in
    production environments.
  - Integrate with OpenRouter and equivalent LLM routing tools
    to balance cost, latency, and quality.
  - Design and refine prompt engineering strategies for
    reliability, context-awareness, and compliance.
  - Build and maintain feedback pipelines for AI model
    evaluation (human-in-the-loop scoring, automated quality
    checks, reinforcement).
  - Expose and maintain REST APIs for AI services, ensuring
    secure, versioned endpoints.
  - Collaborate with backend/frontend teams to keep microservice
    architecture aligned and maintainable.
  - Track token consumption, latency, and error rates to ensure
    production-grade performance.
  
  Required Skills
  
  - Programming: Strong in Python, with experience in
    production-grade codebases.
  - Frameworks: Flask (for APIs), FastAPI (optional),
    Uvicorn/Gunicorn for async hosting.
  - Queues/Workers: Dramatiq (or Celery/RQ equivalent) for
    background jobs.
  - AI/ML: Hands-on with LLMs and VLMs, including prompt
    engineering, fine-tuning, and evaluation.
  - AI Infrastructure: Familiar with OpenRouter or equivalent
    LLM/VLM routing & fallback tools.
  - Architecture: Experience designing and maintaining
    microservice architectures.
  - APIs: Strong experience with REST API design (auth, rate
    limiting, documentation).
  - Production: Dockerized deployments, CI/CD pipelines,
    logging/monitoring, error handling.
  - Feedback Loops: Building structured evaluation/feedback
    systems for AI model performance.
  - Cloud: AWS/GCP experience preferred (deployment, monitoring,
    scaling).
  
  Experience
  
  - 3–5 years as an AI Engineer or Python Backend Engineer
    working with production systems.
  - Prior work with SaaS platforms, LLM/VLM integrations, or AI-
    first products is highly valued.
  
  Demonstrated ability to maintain AI pipelines in production,
  not just prototypes.
