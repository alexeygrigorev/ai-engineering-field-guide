description: |
  We are seeking an AI Research Engineer to build AI-driven
  systems that accelerate alpha discovery for a systematic
  quantitative hedge fund. This role focuses on leveraging
  advanced AI coding tools (e.g., Claude Code and other LLM-
  based agents) to design automated research workflows that
  generate new data variables, predictive signals, and
  systematic trading strategies.
  
  You will operate at the intersection of quantitative
  research, machine learning, and AI-augmented development —
  building scalable systems that materially increase research
  velocity and idea quality.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Design AI-assisted research pipelines for data ingestion,
    feature engineering, alpha generation, and backtesting.
  - Build agentic workflows that autonomously explore datasets
    and propose candidate signals.
  - Rapidly prototype and evaluate systematic strategies with
    robust validation frameworks.
  - Improve research efficiency by integrating AI coding agents
    into the quant workflow.
  - Partner with researchers and PMs to transition validated
    alphas into production-ready implementations.
  
  Requirements
  
  - Strong programming skills in Python and experience building
    research infrastructure.
  - Deep understanding of statistics, machine learning, and
    backtesting methodology.
  - Hands-on experience using AI coding tools (e.g., Claude
    Code, GPT-based agents) in a development workflow.
  - Experience in quantitative research, systematic trading, or
    alpha development preferred.
  
  Benefits
  
  - Competitive salary plus bonus based on individual and
    company performance.
  - Collaborative, Casual, and friendly work environment.
  - PPO Health, dental and vision insurance premiums fully
    covered for you and your dependents.
  - Pre-tax commuter benefits.
  - Weekly company meals.
  
  Applications are open for both Stamford and New York City
  offices, the latter with a planned opening in October 2026.
  
  The base salary for this role is $120,000 to $150,000, and
  will be determined based on the candidate’s educational
  background and professional experience. Base salary is one
  component of Trexquant’s total compensation package, which
  may also include a discretionary, performance-based bonus.
  This position is classified as overtime-exempt.
