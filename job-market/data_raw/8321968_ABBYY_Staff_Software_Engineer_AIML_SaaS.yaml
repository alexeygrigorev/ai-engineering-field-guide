  About the role
  
  We are looking for a Staff Software Engineer to help build
  and scale ABBYY’s AI platform. This role sits at the
  intersection of platform engineering, MLOps, and DevOps. You
  will own how AI services are built, deployed, observed, and
  evolved in production, with a strong focus on Kubernetes,
  cloud infrastructure, and ML lifecycle automation.
  
  This is a hands-on technical leadership role. You will
  design systems, write production code, influence
  architecture, and mentor engineers.
  
  What you’ll do: · Design and build scalable AI platform
  services using Python and microservice architectures · Own
  DevOps and MLOps workflows including CI/CD, model
  deployment, versioning, and rollback · Build and maintain
  Kubernetes-based platforms for AI workloads · Work on data
  pipelines, dataset versioning, and auto-labeling workflows
  for model training · Enable end-to-end ML lifecycle: data
  ingestion, training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring
  · Collaborate closely with ML researchers, product teams,
  and other platform engineers · Drive best practices in
  software design, reliability, security, and observability ·
  Lead technical discussions, review designs, and mentor team
  members
  
  What We’re looking for: · 10+ years of experience in backend
  or platform engineering · Strong proficiency in Python (or
  similar backend languages) · Solid experience building
  microservices and distributed systems · Hands-on expertise
  with Kubernetes in production environments · Strong
  understanding of DevOps and MLOps principles · Experience
  with data management for ML (datasets, labeling, pipelines)
  · Cloud experience with Azure or strong willingness to adopt
  Azure quickly · Ability to think at system level and still
  deliver hands-on
  
  Nice to have: · Experience building internal AI/ML platforms
  · Familiarity with model serving frameworks and inference
  optimization · Exposure to auto-labeling, weak supervision,
  or human-in-the-loop systems · Experience in enterprise or
  B2B SaaS environments
