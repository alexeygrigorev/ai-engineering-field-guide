  Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?
  
  At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in
  the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that
  demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging
  onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial
  system.
  
  To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific
  candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our
  mission and who believes in the power of crypto and
  blockchain technology to update the financial system. We
  want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world,
  who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high
  caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep
  leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away
  from, solving the company’s hardest problems.
  
  Our work culture is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if
  you want to build the future alongside others who excel in
  their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no
  better place to be.
  
  While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not
  remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout
  the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple
  times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and
  alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.
  
  You will be joining a small technical team working with
  Brian Armstrong, Coinbase CEO, on developing consumer facing
  AI products.
  
  What you'll be doing:
  
  - Design and build core services and interfaces that turn
    natural-language goals into safe, compliant Coinbase
    product workflows
  - Implement risk and compliance guardrails directly into
    execution paths
  - Work closely with many different product teams at Coinbase
    to externalize their features through AI-native
    experiences, ensuring consistency of concepts, style, and
    design
  - Troubleshoot and debug complex fullstack issues, ensuring
    stability, reliability, and security
  - Participate in code reviews and provide constructive
    feedback to maintain high code quality standards
  
  What we look for in you:
  
  - 5+ years of experience in both backend and frontend software
    development
  - Experience in Go and Typescript
  - Experience in React/React Native
  - Experience working cross-functionally with legal, security,
    compliance, and engineering teams.
  
  Nice to haves:
  
  - Familiarity with financial services, crypto, or high-growth
    tech environments is a plus
  - Experience operating in startups, building products 0-1, and
    high agency / ownership
  - Experience with financially regulated products, a plus
  - Experience in applied AI (Foundational Models, Agents, RAG)
