  Software Engineer, AI — Code Evaluation & Training (Remote)
  
  List of accepted countries and locations
  
  Help train large-language models (LLMs) to write production-
  grade code across a wide range of programming languages:
  
  - Compare & rank multiple code snippets, explaining which is
    best and why.
  - Repair & refactor AI-generated code for correctness,
    efficiency, and style.
  - Inject feedback (ratings, edits, test results) into the RLHF
    pipeline and keep it running smoothly.End result: the
    model learns to propose, critique, and improve code the
    way you do.
  
  RLHF in one line Generate code ➜ expert engineers rank,
  edit, and justify ➜ convert that feedback into reward
  signals ➜ reinforcement learning tunes the model toward code
  you’d actually ship.
  
  What You’ll Need
  
  - 3+ years of professional software engineering experience in
    C(Constraint programming experience is a bonus, but not
    required)
  - Strong code-review instincts—you can spot logic errors,
    performance traps, and security issues quickly.
  - Extreme attention to detail and excellent written
    communication skills.Much of this role involves explaining
    why one approach is better than another. This cannot be
    overstated.
  - You enjoy reading documentation and language specs and
    thrive in an asynchronous, low-oversight environment.
  
  What You Don’t Need
  
  - No prior RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)
    or AI training experience.
  - No deep machine learning knowledge. If you can review and
    critique code clearly, we’ll teach you the rest.
  
  Tech Stack
  
  We are looking for engineers with a strong command of C.
