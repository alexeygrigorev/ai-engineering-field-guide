  About this role
  
  About this Role: At BlackRock, technology is the foundation
  of our business. As an AI Engineer (GenAI/ML), you’ll lead
  by example — architecting, coding, and mentoring teams to
  build resilient systems that apply Generative AI and Machine
  Learning to improve operational efficiency, user experience,
  and insight generation across our global post-trade
  operations. You’ll design and deliver enterprise-scale AI-
  enabled software with a focus on reliability, governance,
  and clean engineering practices.
  
  This role is ideal for a technical leader who enjoys staying
  close to the code, guiding design decisions, and building
  agentic systems (tool-using AI agents) and ML services — all
  while fostering a culture of excellence and continuous
  improvement.
  
  About Post Trade Accounting (PTA):
  
  - A major strategic area within Aladdin and one of BlackRock’s
    largest engineering investments.
  - Responsible for the systems that ensure accurate, scalable,
    and efficient accounting across global operations.
  - Expanding into data analytics and pipeline initiatives using
    Snowflake, Redis, and Kafka to manage high-volume, real-
    time data.
  - Collaborates closely with Product, Operations, and other
    Engineering teams to deliver business-critical
    capabilities.
  - Agile and collaborative environment that values technical
    depth, quality, and innovation.
  
  Key Responsibilities:
  
  - Design and develop production AI services that embed GenAI
    and ML into enterprise workflows.
  - Build AI agents that can plan and execute multi-step tasks
    by calling approved tools/APIs, retrieving context,
    validating outputs, and safely handling failure cases.
  - Implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using
    vector search and hybrid retrieval to ground responses in
    enterprise data and documentation.
  - Develop ML components where appropriate (e.g.,
    classification, ranking, anomaly detection) and integrate
    them with LLM-based systems for hybrid intelligence.
  - Establish robust evaluation and quality gates for agents and
    LLM systems (golden datasets, automated tests, regression
    suites, monitoring for drift/quality).
  - Implement enterprise-grade governance: audit trails,
    provenance/citations, access control, privacy handling,
    and versioning (models/prompts/chains).
  - Champion best practices for code quality, testing,
    automation, and performance/cost optimization.
  - Mentor engineers to elevate technical craftsmanship,
    problem-solving, and design thinking.
  - Collaborate cross-functionally to ensure technical solutions
    align with product goals and business outcomes.
  
  Qualifications / Competencies:
  
  - B.S./M.S. in Computer Science, Engineering, or related
    discipline.
  - 8+ years of professional software engineering experience
    building and operating distributed systems in production.
  - 3+ years delivering ML/AI systems to production with
    measurable outcomes and operational ownership.
  - Demonstrable experience designing and building AI agents
    (agentic workflows) that:
    - perform multi-step reasoning and task execution,
    - use tools/functions/APIs,
    - manage state appropriately,
    - and include guardrails, validation, and safe fallback
      behavior.
  - Strong knowledge of agentic design patterns, such as
    planning/execution loops, routing/specialist agents,
    retrieval + tool orchestration, verification/reflection,
    and human-in-the-loop approvals.
  - Hands-on experience with LLM orchestration frameworks (e.g.,
    LangChain or similar), including building reusable
    chains/agents and enforcing structured outputs.
  - Hands-on experience with vector databases / retrieval
    systems (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, pgvector,
    Elastic vector search, etc.) including indexing, chunking
    strategies, and hybrid search.
  - Strong Python for AI/ML development and automation; strong
    backend experience in Java and/or TypeScript (APIs,
    services, integration patterns).
  - Solid applied ML and evaluation fundamentals: dataset
    construction, precision/recall tradeoffs, calibration, and
    drift/quality monitoring.
  - Enterprise mindset for security and controls: data
    minimization, auditability, traceability, access control,
    and operational resilience.
  - Strong focus on clean architecture, maintainability, and
    production readiness.
  - Excellent communication and leadership skills — able to
    guide teams and influence design direction.
  
  Nice to Have:
  
  - Experience with Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud-native
    environments (AWS/GCP).
  - Observability experience: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus/Grafana,
    and AI/LLM telemetry (quality metrics, latency, cost,
    tool-call traces).
  - MLOps maturity: model registry, reproducibility, CI/CD for
    ML, feature stores, and governance workflows.
  - Responsible AI experience: red-teaming, prompt injection
    defenses, content safety filters, privacy-preserving
    patterns.
  - Familiarity with enterprise workflow/case management
    patterns and building AI into operational processes.
  - Interest in financial systems, accounting, or investment
    technology.
