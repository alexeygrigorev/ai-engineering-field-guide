  About Savvy Wealth:
  
  Wealth management is a $545 billion industry in the US, yet
  remains archaic and inefficient with low technology
  penetration. 75% of financial advisors don’t offer digital
  communication beyond email, and 62% still build financial
  plans manually in Excel. This leads to a poor client
  experience and results in financial advisors spending over
  70% of their time on non-client facing, manual work.
  
  Savvy is changing that. We’re building the most advisor-
  centric platform in wealth management: a digital-first
  solution that modernizes human financial advice. Advisors
  who partner with Savvy tap into AI-powered software,
  automated sales and marketing, and seamless back office
  workflows to scale faster and spend more time with clients.
  
  We’ve raised over $105M to date from Thrive Capital, Index
  Ventures, Canvas Ventures, Mark Casady (former LPL Financial
  CEO), and other top-tier investors. Our team is made up of
  repeat founders and operators who’ve helped build Airbnb,
  Square, Brex, Carta, Facebook, $200B+ RIAs, and more.
  
  Savvy is at a pivotal point in its growth trajectory, having
  established strong product-market fit in providing a modern
  platform to financial advisors. We’ve surpassed $2.2 billion
  in AUM in less than three years, grown 600%+ in the last 18
  months, and are entering the next phase of the company which
  involves rapid expansion of our product offering and
  continued revenue growth. Come help us scale!
  
  Responsibilities

    recommendations), with a bias toward shipping quickly
  - Rapidly prototype and deliver using modern AI tooling (e.g.,
    Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, Devin, etc.) while
    maintaining high engineering standards - from using
    individual tools to get work done all the way up to
    leveraging a complex orchestration layer to string
    together a dozen tools to get things done even faster
  - Own the end-to-end product development lifecycle - identify
    opportunities, design solutions, ship to production, and
    iterate

  Senior
  
  - Build Savvy AI systems (RAG, classification/extraction

  - Set technical direction for applied AI across multiple
    product areas
  - Drive roadmap shaping with

    as well as personal
