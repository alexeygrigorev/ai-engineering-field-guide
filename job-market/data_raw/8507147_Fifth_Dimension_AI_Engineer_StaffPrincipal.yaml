  About Us:
  
  Fifth Dimension is bringing vibe working to document-heavy
  industries 🌈. Today we work with real estate businesses in
  the US, EU and APAC, automating complex tasks, extracting
  valuable insights from documents, and empowering
  professionals to focus on high-impact work. Our AI workspace
  transforms how large investment managers and developers
  handle leases, development documents, and investment
  decisions.
  
  We're a London and New York based startup with an ample
  runway, backed by Tier 1 European and American investors.
  Our founders, Johnny Morris and Dr. Kate Jarvis bring a
  powerful blend of expertise (and spice 🌶️): Johnny has 17+
  years applying data and analytics to Real Estate, while Kate
  holds a Stanford PhD and 12 years of executive experience
  across Silicon Valley and London startups. At Fifth
  Dimension, we're demanding yet encouraging, valuing
  experimentation and kind challenges. Our company values, Own
  It, Ship It, and Don't Be Boring, drive us to deliver
  exceptional results while fostering a culture of innovation
  and continuous improvement.
  
  The Challenge
  
  It's 9 AM on a Monday. Using Claude Code, you've just
  implemented a new extraction pipeline that transforms how
  property leases are analyzed. By noon, a major real estate
  firm emails: "This just saved us 40 hours of work." By
  Thursday, you're troubleshooting with their development team
  as they integrate your APIs into their enterprise document
  management system. By Friday, you're celebrating with the
  team as data flows seamlessly between platforms, unlocking
  new capabilities for real estate investors that will help
  them make faster, more informed decisions across their
  portfolios.
  
  About You
  
  You're an expert software engineer who's witnessed the
  transformative power of AI and wants to apply it to solve
  real business problems. You don't just code—you architect
  solutions that make users say "How did we ever work without
  this?"
  
  You've developed exceptional engineering and architectural
  skills through years of practice. You stay current with AI
  advances and can identify the right approach for each unique
  challenge. Your experience implementing AI in business
  contexts has taught you that the magic isn't in the
  model—it's in understanding the problem deeply.
  
  You're proficient with AI coding assistance tools like
  Claude Code, leveraging them to accelerate development and
  focus on higher-level architectural challenges. You
  understand that modern engineering means effectively
  collaborating with AI to maximise your productivity and
  creative potential.
  
  Details don't escape you. You're comfortable diving into
  complex documents and intricate code to build a complete
  picture. As someone who thrives in fast-paced environments,
  you adapt quickly and mentor other engineers while
  collaborating effectively with commercial teams and
  customers.
  
  You're passionate about your personal growth and see each
  complex problem as an opportunity to expand your
  capabilities. You actively seek challenges that push the
  boundaries of what's possible and value environments where
  you can both contribute your expertise and continue to
  evolve as an engineer.
  
  Your Impact
  
  Reporting to our CTO Chen, you'll architect and implement
  innovative AI technology to meet our enterprise customers'
  unique needs. Working closely with our skilled engineering
  team, you'll design scalable AI solutions that deliver
  tangible value and expand the capabilities of our generative
  AI platform. You'll own the complete lifecycle of core
  product capabilities from initial customer conversations
  through architecture, implementation, deployment, and
  customer adoption.
  
  Day to Day, You Will
  
  - Think like a Product Manager+: Own core product components
    while balancing technical excellence with business impact
  - Own end-to-end delivery of complex features from initial
    concept to production deployment and customer adoption
  - Collaborate with product and commercial teams to understand
    customer needs and translate them into robust technical
    solutions
  - Leverage AI coding tools like Claude Code to accelerate
    development workflows
  - Lead development of features solving our customers' most
    complex challenges:
    - Advanced data extraction systems for processing property
      leases at scale
    - Sophisticated workflow automation for analyzing planning
      documents and drafting advice
    - Multi-step agentic content generation for creating market
      research reports
  - Implement data privacy and security by design
  - Stay ahead of relevant research and technologies
  - Mentor other engineers and help establish engineering best
    practices
  - Invest in your own growth by taking on ambitious technical
    challenges and expanding your expertise
  - Apply our engineering philosophy: intellectual honesty,
    effective time management, clear communication, and
    innovation
  
  Our Values and Engineering Culture
  
  At 5D, we embody three core principles: Own it, Ship it, and
  Don't be boring.
  
  Our engineering team values:
  
  - Product-Minded Engineering: Understanding the "why" behind
    features and using technical expertise to inform product
    decisions
  - Intellectual Honesty: Backing discussions with data and
    acknowledging knowledge gaps
  - Effective Time Management: Setting clear timebox and
    abandoning approaches that aren't working
  - Clear Communication: Writing self-documenting code and
    providing detailed explanations
  - Innovation Mindset: Forming well-reasoned opinions backed by
    data and continuously learning
  - Personal Growth: Supporting your development through
    challenging work and opportunities to expand your
    expertise
  
  Intellectual Curiosity and Honesty in Action: An Example
  
  Here's an example of how we work: Early in our journey with
  AI, one of our engineers discovered that certain words like
  "concise" or "creative" had disproportionate effects on
  model outputs—we called them "demon words." Rather than
  accepting this as an immutable quirk, they spent a week
  methodically tracking down every instance in our codebase,
  testing alternatives, and documenting the patterns they
  found. This intellectual curiosity to understand the "why"
  behind technical oddities, combined with the honesty to
  admit what we didn't yet understand, led to significant
  improvements in our product's reliability. At 5D, we value
  this combination of curiosity and honesty above all—the
  willingness to dive deep into unexpected behaviors and
  openly share both successes and failures with the team.
  
  What We're Looking For
  
  - Experience in high-growth startups or fast-paced tech
    environments
  - Track record building software in organizations with
    excellent engineering practices
  - History of owning end-to-end product development, from
    definition to delivery and customer adoption
  - Strong Python skills with a track record of shipping
    customer-facing features on critical paths
  - Experience building and maintaining high-quality APIs and
    integrations
  - Proficiency with AI coding assistance tools (Cursor, GitHub
    Copilot, Claude Code)
  - Intellectual curiosity and honesty—digging deep into
    problems and sharing findings openly
  - Proven ability to make technical decisions that balance
    immediate user needs with long-term architecture
  - Exceptional communication abilities for explaining complex
    concepts to diverse audiences
  - Ambition and resilience—we're a seed-stage company tackling
    ambitious challenges
  - Commercial awareness—delivering continuous value to
    customers is essential
  - Passion for personal growth and continuous learning
  
  Nice to Have (But Not Required)
  
  - Past experience in real estate, law, or finance
  - Background with robust software testing and deployment
    practices
  - Experience with component-based system design and
    microservices
  - Contributions to open-source projects or broader technical
    communities
