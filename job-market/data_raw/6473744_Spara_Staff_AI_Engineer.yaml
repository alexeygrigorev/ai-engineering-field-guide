  About Spara
  
  Spara is building enterprise-grade AI agents to instantly
  engage, qualify, & convert sales leads into pipeline &
  revenue. We believe every company will soon provide AI-
  powered, human-level sales conversations to their
  customers—and we’re building the platform to make that
  possible.
  
  Sales is the economic engine of every company, representing
  an addressable market of $28B. We're solving this complex,
  high revenue problem with a multi-modal approach including
  chat, email, voice, and beyond. This gives us a significant
  advantage in the market and presents exciting engineering
  opportunities.
  
  We are a tight-knit, experienced team building a multi-
  billion dollar AI-first company in the heart of New York
  City. Our culture emphasizes thoughtful decisions,
  sustainable development practices, and steady momentum
  building on deep expertise.
  
  Spara is backed by $15M in funding from top-tier venture
  capital firms, led by Radical Ventures & Inspired Capital,
  and supported by AI luminaries including founders of PyTorch
  and Google Cloud TPU, as well as Heads of Sales at Anthropic
  and OpenAI.
  
  We are led by seasoned multi-time founders with deep AI and
  go-to-market expertise:
  
  - David, previous co-founder/CEO of Triplemint, ran training,
    coaching, and operations for a 250 person sales team. He
    led Triplemint to acquisition and currently sits on the
    board of The Agency RE, a $250M revenue business.
  - Zander was technical co-founder of Nomad Health (now post-
    Series D). He most recently led Platform at Hyperscience
    AI, developing workflow orchestration systems for computer
    vision models.
