  Rigor team, you will report to Technical Program Manager.
  You will work closely with our team of researchers,
  clinicians, and software engineers to design, prototype,
  deploy and maintain ML solutions that will enhance our
  mental health tools. You will design and implement advanced
  AI solutions, in particular in the natural language
  processing space, and develop automated evaluation
  frameworks aligned with clinical expertise. You will
  rigorously test and refine large language models to ensure
  safety and effectiveness in sensitive clinical contexts.
  This role requires deep expertise in large language models,
  agentic AI systems, and the ability to apply AI technologies
  responsibly while working at the intersection of AI research
  and mental health care.
  
  This is an exempt, full-time, hybrid position located in our
  NYC headquarters office or other relevant location. This

  office, on a schedule determined by your supervisor. The in-
  office requirement and schedule are subject to change based
  on the needs of the program and the organization.
  
  You Will:
  
  - Develop machine learning models with a focus on NLP and LLMs
    for real-world application in the mental health field.
  - Develop and improve LLMs and agentic AI systems for
    generating synthetic multi-turn conversation data at scale
  - Build automated evaluation systems for assessing model
    performance and safety · Collaborate with clinical experts
    to translate therapeutic expectations into quantifiable AI
    evaluation criteria
  - Conduct evaluation of AI systems using expert-annotated
    benchmarks · Perform longitudinal analysis of model
    behavior and identify factors contributing to performance
    variations over time
  - Ensure data quality, security, and compliance with privacy
    regulations for handling sensitive data.
  - Contribute to scalable, well-documented code for web
    applications and analytic pipelines that is suitable for
    computing ecosystems and shared to GitHub, or equivalent,
    repositories for version control.
  - Perform additional job-related responsibilities as assigned.
  
  You Have:
  
  - Master's degree in Neuroscience, Computer Science, Machine
    Learning, Engineering or equivalent combination of
    education and experience is required.
  - 8+ years of experience in data analysis and data science
    fundamentals (e.g., algorithms, data structures, data
    visualization, machine learning), preferably in a clinical
    or research setting.
  - 8+ years of experience in at least one scientific
    programming language (e.g., Python/R, Matlab) and related
    toolboxes or frameworks (e.g., Tidyverse, Scipy, Sklearn,
    Polars, Pytorch) is required.
  - 8+ years of experience working in a Linux environment, using
    version control systems (e.g., GitHub), and software
    virtualization platforms (e.g., Docker)
  - 5+ years of practical experience designing and developing
    Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
    technologies using ML and NLP toolchains (e.g., pytorch,
    tensorflow, SpaCy, HuggingFace, NLTK.)
  - Hands-on industry experience training, evaluating, and
    deploying Machine Learning models while making necessary
    tradeoffs given the deployment context.
