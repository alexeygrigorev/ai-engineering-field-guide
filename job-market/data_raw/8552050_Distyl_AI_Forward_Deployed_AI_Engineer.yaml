  About Distyl AI
  
  Distyl AI develops production-grade AI systems to power core
  operational workflows for Fortune 500 companies. Powered by
  a strategic partnership with OpenAI, in-house software
  accelerators, and deep enterprise AI expertise, we deliver
  working AI systems with rapid time to value – within a
  quarter.
  
  Our products have helped Fortune 500 customers across
  diverse industries, from insurance and CPG to non-profits.
  As part of our team, you will help companies identify,
  build, and realize value from their GenAI investments, often
  for the first time. We are customer-centric, working
  backward from the customer’s problem and holding ourselves
  accountable for creating both financial impact and improving
  the lives of end-users.
  
  Distyl is led by proven leaders from top companies like
  Palantir and Apple and is backed by Lightspeed, Khosla,
  Coatue, Dell Technologies Capital, Nat Friedman (Former CEO
  of GitHub), Brad Gerstner (Founder and CEO of Altimeter),
  and board members of over a dozen Fortune 500 companies.
  
  What We Are Looking For
  
  At Distyl, Forward Deployed AI Engineers build and operate
  AI systems that deliver real business value inside customer
  environments. This role is for engineers who thrive in
  ambiguous problem spaces, take ownership of outcomes, and
  are excited to work directly on production AI systems that
  must perform reliably under real-world constraints.
  
  Forward Deployed AI Engineers are hands-on builders who
  design, deploy, and iterate on end-to-end AI systems. They
  work close to customers to understand real requirements,
  translate them into concrete system designs, and
  continuously improve system behavior through evaluation,
  iteration, and integration. Their focus is not on demos or
  experiments in isolation, but on making AI systems work in
  practice.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Own the behavior and performance of AI systems deployed for
    customers
  - Design and implement compound AI workflows that combine
    models, agents, retrieval, evaluation, and execution into
    coherent, production-ready systems aligned with real SME
    needs
  - Operate on live systems, measuring behavior, identifying
    failure modes, and iterating rapidly to improve quality,
    reliability, and usefulness. This includes designing
    prompts and agent logic, building evaluation frameworks,
    integrating feedback loops, and using AI-driven tools to
    accelerate debugging and experimentation
  - Integrate AI systems into customer data platforms, APIs, and
    existing applications. You'll make pragmatic system design
    decisions that balance speed, robustness, and
    maintainability, and ensure systems remain understandable
    and operable over time
  - Work directly with customer stakeholders—often in high-
    visibility settings—and are expected to reason clearly
    about system behavior, tradeoffs, and limitations.
  - Take accountability for outcomes in production and adapt
    systems as requirements evolve
  
  What We Require
  
  - 2+ years of software engineering experience
  - Ownership Mentality for AI Systems: You take responsibility
    for whether an AI system actually delivers its intended
    value in production. You are comfortable making
    independent technical decisions across system design,
    evaluation, and integration, and owning the results of
    those decisions
  - Experience Building AI Systems, Not Just Calling APIs: Built
    applications powered by LLMs or other AI models and are
    comfortable composing multiple components—prompts, agents,
    tools, retrieval, evaluators—into end-to-end systems. You
    reason about system behavior holistically rather than
    treating models as black boxes
  - Strong Engineering Fundamentals: Write clean, maintainable
    Python and are comfortable building and operating real
    systems. You understand core engineering concepts like
    versioning, debugging, testing, and performance, and can
    build systems that hold up under real usage and scrutiny
  - AI-Native Working Style: Use AI tools daily to write and
    debug code, explore designs, analyze data, and automate
    repetitive work. You are curious about new model
    capabilities and techniques, and actively incorporate them
    into how you build and iterate on systems
  - Comfort in Customer Environments: Able to work directly with
    customer teams, ask good questions, and adapt quickly to
    new domains. You communicate clearly about system behavior
    and limitations, and can operate effectively in high-
    trust, high-visibility situations
  - Travel: Ability to travel 25-50%
  
  What We Offer
  
  - The base salary range for this role is $130K – $250K,
    depending on experience, location, and level. In addition
    to base compensation, this role is eligible for meaningful
    equity, along with a comprehensive benefits package
  - 100% covered medical, dental, and vision for employees and
    dependents
  - 401(k) with additional perks (e.g., commuter benefits,
    in‑office lunch)
  - Access to state‑of‑the‑art models, generous usage of modern
    AI tools, and real‑world business problems
  - Ownership of high‑impact projects across top enterprises
  - A mission‑driven, fast‑moving culture that prizes curiosity,
    pragmatism, and excellence
  
  Distyl has offices in San Francisco and New York. This role
  follows a hybrid collaboration model with 3+ days per week
  (Tuesday–Thursday) in‑office.
  
  We’re grateful for the strong interest in this role. The
  best way to get your profile in front of our team is to
  apply directly through our careers page, where all
  applications are reviewed. Due to the high volume of
  interest, we’re not able to review or respond to all direct
  emails or LinkedIn messages. We will be in touch with every
  applicant once we’ve completed our review, regardless of the
  decision.
