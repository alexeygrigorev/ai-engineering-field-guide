  visibility-driven recommendation systems that serve both
  internal stakeholders and external customers. This
  initiative aims to deliver actionable insights that enhance
  supply chain execution, support strategic decision-making,
  and enable innovative service offerings. Data AI/ML
  (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) Engineering
  involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to
  enable systems to analyse data, learn patterns, and make
  data-driven predictions or decisions without explicit human
  programming. AI/ML applications leverage vast amounts of
  data to identify insights, automate processes, and solve
  complex problems across a wide range of fields, including
  healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and more. AI/ML processes
  transform raw data into actionable intelligence, enabling
  automation, predictive analytics, and intelligent solutions.
  Data AI/ML combines advanced statistical modelling,
  computational power, and data engineering to build
  intelligent systems that can learn, adapt, and automate
  decisions. What I'll be doing – your accountabilities?
