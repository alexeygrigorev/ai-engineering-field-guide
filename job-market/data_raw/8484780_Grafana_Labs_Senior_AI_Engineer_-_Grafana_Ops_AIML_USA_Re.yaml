description: |
  Grafana Labs is a remote-first, open-source powerhouse.
  There are more than 20M users of Grafana, the open source
  visualization tool, around the globe, monitoring everything
  from beehives to climate change in the Alps. The instantly
  recognizable dashboards have been spotted everywhere from a
  NASA launch and Minecraft HQ to Wimbledon and the Tour de
  France. Grafana Labs also helps more than 3,000 companies --
  including Bloomberg, JPMorgan Chase, and eBay -- manage
  their observability strategies with the Grafana LGTM Stack,
  which can be run fully managed with Grafana Cloud or self-
  managed with the Grafana Enterprise Stack, both featuring
  scalable metrics (Grafana Mimir), logs (Grafana Loki), and
  traces (Grafana Tempo).
  
  We’re scaling fast and staying true to what makes us
  different: an open-source legacy, a global collaborative
  culture, and a passion for meaningful work. Our team thrives
  in an innovation-driven environment where transparency,
  autonomy, and trust fuel everything we do.
  
  You may not meet every requirement, and that’s okay. If this
  role excites you, we’d love you to raise your hand for what
  could be a truly career-defining opportunity.
  
  This is a remote opportunity and we would be interested in
  applicants from USA time zones only at this time.
  
  Senior AI Engineer
  
  The Opportunity:
  
  At Grafana, we build observability tools that help users
  understand, respond to, and improve their systems –
  regardless of scale, complexity, or tech stack. The Grafana
  AI teams play a key role in this mission by helping users
  make sense of complex observability data through AI-driven
  features. These capabilities reduce toil, lower the barrier
  of domain expertise, and surface meaningful signals from
  noisy environments.
  
  What makes our team different is how we work: we operate
  with a high degree of autonomy and ownership, both as
  individuals and as a team. Engineers are empowered to make
  decisions, move quickly, and validate ideas early – while
  being supported by a deeply collaborative culture that
  values curiosity, feedback, and cross-functional
  partnership.
  
  We’re looking for an AI Software Engineer with a strong
  software engineering background, a quick iteration mindset,
  and a passion for experimentation – balanced by a focus on
  shipping and scaling impactful features that deliver value
  to users. You’ll work closely with cross-functional teams to
  develop, test, and ship AI-powered features that contribute
  to improving infrastructure and observability quality
  through automation, while also expanding the capabilities of
  AI agents across the observability stack to assist users
  with incident response. As the team matures, there’s a broad
  opportunity to expand or redefine this role based on impact
  and initiative.
  
  What You’ll Be Doing:
  
  - Build and deliver AI solutions: Take ownership of developing
    high-performance AI features to help users detect, triage,
    and resolve incidents using observability data and tools.
  - Rapid experimentation and iteration: Implement a highly
    iterative process where you quickly prototype, test, and
    validate with real users, including shipping and evolving
    LLM- or agent-powered workflows for incident lifecycle
    management and automated analysis tasks.
  - Collaborate cross-functionally: Work with data analysts,
    product managers, and designers to shape AI-driven product
    features, including integration of agentic components with
    internal tools, alerting systems, runbooks, and developer
    workflows.
  - Utilize AI tools effectively: Use AI and automation tools to
    enhance both product functionality and your own
    development workflows.
  - Effective communication: You’ll be working in a highly
    dynamic and collaborative environment, so we need someone
    who can communicate effectively and contribute across
    teams.
  - Ownership and impact: Take full ownership of the AI
    solutions you develop, ensuring they are not only
    innovative but also scalable, maintainable, and aligned
    with real user workflows.
  
  We invest heavily in developer productivity. You can use
  modern AI coding assistants as part of your daily workflow
  (your choice of tools, within security guidelines), backed
  by a company-funded usage budget so you can iterate quickly
  without unnecessary friction. We encourage pragmatic AI-
  assisted development: faster prototyping, test generation,
  refactors, documentation, and incident follow-ups—always
  paired with strong code review and quality standards. You’ll
  also have access to frontier models (e.g., GPT-Codex 5/3,
  Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 Pro).
  
  What Makes You a Great Fit:
  
  - Strong engineering skills: Solid experience building
    production software systems (backend and / or full stack).
    You’re a self-starter, capable of tackling complex
    engineering problems with minimal supervision.
  - AI experience with a practical mindset: You’re familiar with
    AI technologies and frameworks, and you focus on
    delivering high-quality solutions that work in the real
    world, not just in theory.
  - Quick iteration and experimentation: You’re comfortable
    releasing prototypes, collecting feedback, and iterating
    with a pragmatic mindset.
  - Proven initiative: You take ownership and drive projects
    forward, pushing boundaries to find the most impactful
    solutions. You can deal with ambiguity and are able to
    define scope where things are loosely defined.
  - Collaborative attitude: You communicate effectively with
    peers, product managers, and designers. You’re open to
    feedback, and you bring a solutions-oriented mindset to
    the table.
  
  Requirements:
  
  - Experience with LLMs, prompt engineering, and building
    applications powered by GenAI.
  - Proven track record of delivering software that made it into
    production and is actively used by users.
  - Exposure to working in cloud-native environments (e.g., AWS,
    GCP, Azure).
  - Experience using observability tools to understand and
    troubleshoot system behavior.
  
  Bonus Points For:
  
  - Experience building or working with agent frameworks or
    multi‑agent workflows.
  - Experience with infrastructure / devops related tooling:
    Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform or similar for deployments.
  - Familiarity with model fine-tuning techniques.
  - Experience building observability tooling.

  In the United States, the Base compensation range for this
  role is USD 154,445  -  USD 185,334. Actual compensation may
  vary based on level, experience, and skillset as assessed in
