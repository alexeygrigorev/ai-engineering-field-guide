  Who We Are:
  
  AND Digital are a tech company focused on accelerating
  digital delivery and dedicated to closing the digital skills
  gap. We’ve been helping organisations build better digital
  products and stronger digital teams since 2014.
  
  We believe our work should always leave a legacy for the
  client. We do this through close relationships with our
  offices (or ‘Clubs’) so that our partners are always
  prioritized by a regional team close to them.
  
  This unique model has driven success for our clients and
  ourselves, evidenced by our remarkable organic growth since
  2014. Today we number more than 1,300 people with Clubs all
  over the UK and Europe with plans for global expansion in
  the next couple of years.
  
  Join us - and help us fulfil our mission to close the
  world’s digital skills gap.
  
  What you’ll bring to the table:Core Technical Expertise:

    in one or more of: Java, Node.js, TypeScript, Python or
    Go, and the ability to work confidently across multiple
    languages when needed.
  - Proven ability to design and build scalable, resilient, and
    maintainable backend systems, including REST/GraphQL APIs,
    event‑driven architectures, and distributed services.
  - Hands‑on experience with AWS (Lambda, ECS, DynamoDB,
    SQS/SNS, API Gateway, Step Functions, etc.) and strong
    understanding of cloud‑native patterns. Exposure to to
    GCP, Azure, or other Cloud Platforms would be a valuable
    plus.
  - Solid experience with Infrastructure as Code (Terraform
    preferred), CI/CD pipelines, and modern deployment
    practices.
  - Comfortable working across the stack, contributing to
    frontend codebases when needed, even though your strength
    lies in backend and systems engineering.
  - Demonstrates technical leadership, shaping architectural
    direction, reviewing designs, and role‑modelling
    high‑quality engineering practices.
  - Strong grounding in system design, including trade‑off
    analysis, performance considerations, observability, and
    operational readiness.
  - Able to take ownership of complex technical problems, make
    pragmatic decisions, and clearly explain reasoning to both
    engineers and non‑technical stakeholders.
  
  AI & Emerging Technology
  
  - Practical experience integrating AI into backend systems —
    e.g., orchestrating AI services, building AI‑powered
    workflows, or leveraging AI tools to improve engineering
    productivity.
  - Experience building AI-enabled systems (including LLM- or
    RAG-based solutions) from MVP or proof-of-concept through
    to production-ready implementations, with consideration
    for reliability, evaluation, security, and
    maintainability.
  - Understands where AI meaningfully enhances backend systems
    (e.g., classification, summarisation, anomaly detection)
    versus where traditional algorithms are more appropriate.
  - Able to evaluate risk, cost, scalability, and
    maintainability when proposing AI‑driven solutions.
  - Curious about emerging AI patterns, frameworks, and tooling,
    with the ability to apply them pragmatically in line with
    client needs.
  - Comfortable advising clients on realistic AI opportunities
    and helping them navigate hype vs. practical value.
  
  Consulting & Client Delivery
  
  - Experience working in a consulting or client-facing
    environment, comfortable operating in ambiguous problem
    spaces and contributing to both solution discovery and
    delivery.
  - Able to balance client outcomes, commercial considerations,
    and technical integrity, adapting approach and
    communication style depending on context.
  - Acts as a trusted technical partner within delivery teams
    and with clients, influencing outcomes through clarity,
    pragmatism, and credibility.
  
  Nice To Have (but valuable)
  
  - Experience with high‑scale distributed systems, event
    streaming (Kafka, Kinesis), or microservices.
  - Exposure to serverless architectures, container
    orchestration or hybrid cloud environments.
  - Familiarity with security best practices, including IAM,
    secrets management, and secure API design.
