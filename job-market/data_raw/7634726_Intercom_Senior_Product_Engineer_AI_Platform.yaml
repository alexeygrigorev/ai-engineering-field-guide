  Intercom is the AI Customer Service company on a mission to
  help businesses provide incredible customer experiences.
  
  Our AI agent Fin, the most advanced customer service AI
  agent on the market, lets businesses deliver always-on,
  impeccable customer service and ultimately transform their
  customer experiences for the better. Fin can also be
  combined with our Helpdesk to become a complete solution
  called the Intercom Customer Service Suite, which provides
  AI enhanced support for the more complex or high touch
  queries that require a human agent.
  
  Founded in 2011 and trusted by nearly 30,000 global
  businesses, Intercom is setting the new standard for
  customer service. Driven by our core values, we push
  boundaries, build with speed and intensity, and consistently
  deliver incredible value to our customers.
  
  Speed is something we fight for every day at Intercom, and
  we believe Berlin is built for people who share that
  instinct. We are drawn to Berlin by its rare blend of deep
  technical talent and rich creative culture – all within a
  vibrant, globally connected city that’s close to our R&D
  hubs in Dublin and London. It’s a place where the best of
  the best technical talent thrive, and where people from
  around the world are eager to relocate and build ambitious
  products.
  
  Our ambition is to hire 100 people in Berlin over the year
  ahead across engineering, AI, data science, product, and
  design. We believe this is the most exciting time to join,
  be the founding R&D talent in the region and make a lasting
  impact as we build the world's number one customer agent!
  
  What's the opportunity?
  
  We’re looking for Senior Product Engineers to join the AI
  Infrastructure team to help Intercom build AI-powered
  products. Product Engineers in AI infrastructure work
  closely with other ML engineers and our ML Scientists teams.
  You will deeply understand our product, our ML tech stack,
  how we develop product, and how we can accelerate that
  process further.
  
  The wider AI group is responsible for defining new ML
  features, researching appropriate algorithms and
  technologies, and rapidly getting first prototypes in our
  customers’ hands.
  
  AI infrastructure is building a platform to move extremely
  quickly, adapting to new AI advancements in a matter of
  days, but providing the safety shield to other engineers so
  our customers always get a good service. We often provide
  services at the core of AI systems, and write framework-
  level code that other engineers and scientists in the AI
  group use daily.
  
  We are very passionate about applying machine learning
  technology, and have productized everything from classic
  supervised models, to cutting-edge unsupervised clustering
  algorithms, to novel applications of transformer neural
  networks. We test and measure the real customer impact of
  each model and change we deploy.
  
  If you are an experienced backend engineer who takes an
  analytical approach to development and has some hands-on
  experience with ML systems and platforms, we'd love to hear
  from you!
  
  What will I be doing?
  
  - Build the systems that power Intercom’s flagship AI
    products. This usually means working in our ML Python tech
    stack, but at times also means working across the product
    on our Rails app too.
  - Work alongside our ML engineers and ML Scientists to bring
    proof-of-concept code to production; ensuring it’s robust
    and scalable for real-world use.
  - Partner with ML engineers and ML scientists to build the
    underlying platform that helps them shape the best AI-
    powered product experience for our customers..
  - Contribute to all phases of software development including
    ideation, prototyping, and implementation and testing.
  - Play an active role in the hiring, mentoring, and career
    development of other engineers.
  - Raise the bar for technical standards, performance,
    reliability, and operational excellence within the group
    and across Intercom.
  
  Profile we’re looking for
  
  - 5+ years of experience shipping high-quality products,
    preferably backend.
  - You can demonstrate significant impact in the work that you
    have done.
  - You take pride in having strong technical fundamentals; you
    love learning and are willing to work hard to invest in
    your development.
  - Deep knowledge of a high-level programming language (for
    example, Python, Ruby etc.)
  - Strong willingness to fight for good outcomes
  - Ability to deep dive into any part of the tech stack.
  - Bias towards progress over perfection.
  - Excited about progress in the AI space.
  
  Bonus skills & attributes
  
  - 1+ year of experience building ML-powered products. You’ll
    be supported by, and learn from teammates with deep ML
    experience.
  - Built or used ML platforms before.
  - Deep understanding of some distributed systems (e.g.
    database, caches, queues, streams).
  - Statistics fundamentals.
