  Job Summary
  
  OpenGov is seeking a highly execution-oriented AI
  Application & Cloud Ops Engineer to design, build, and
  deploy internal AI-powered applications that improve how our
  teams operate. You will be among the first members of our
  Pune AI engineering team, with significant ownership and
  influence over how we build and scale AI systems globally.
  
  This role focuses on developing intuitive front-end
  interfaces, building robust backend APIs, and
  productionizing AI workflows using Snowflake Snowpark
  Container Services (SPCS) and modern CI/CD practices that
  support agentic experiences.
  
  You will work closely with AI, Data, and Enterprise Systems
  teams to transform in-house AI capabilities into usable,
  scalable applications. From internal web and Slack apps to
  production-grade AI-first copilots and AI-native interfaces,
  you will be responsible for shipping end-to-end solutions
  that are secure, observable, and maintainable.
  
  This is a hands-on engineering role requiring strong full-
  stack fundamentals, disciplined deployment practices, and
  experience containerizing and operationalizing applications
  within a Snowflake-centric environment.
  
  We are looking for a builder who can move quickly from data
  product to UI mock up to deployed solution, while
  maintaining production-grade standards.
  
  Core Responsibilities
  
  - Design, architect, and develop internal AI-powered
    applications using modern frontend frameworks such as
    React or lightweight frameworks such as Streamlit.
  - Utilize AI coding best practices to build and maintain
    backend services and APIs (FastAPI, Flask, Node.js, or
    similar) to support AI-driven workflows and integrations.
  - Containerize applications and deploy them using Snowflake
    Snowpark Container Services (SPCS).
  - Design, implement, and maintain CI/CD pipelines using GitHub
    Actions or equivalent tooling.
  - Establish version control standards, branching strategies,
    automated testing workflows, and release processes for
    internal, fast-paced tools.
  - Deploy and manage multi-component applications, including
    operational data stores, APIs, orchestration services, and
    frontend clients.
  - Implement authentication, authorization, and secure access
    patterns across internal tools.
  - Integrate AI workflows into enterprise platforms such as
    Slack, Salesforce, and other SaaS systems.
  - Partner with AI Platform engineers to expose RAG pipelines,
    agent workflows, and data services through scalable APIs
    and interfaces.
  - Implement logging, monitoring, and observability best
    practices across deployed applications.
  - Optimize application performance, container efficiency, and
    deployment reliability.
  - Support rapid prototyping of internal tools while ensuring
    smooth transition from prototype to production.
  - Continuously improve deployment automation and reduce
    operational friction.
  
  Required Experience
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a
    related field.
  - 7–10 years of experience in software engineering, platform
    engineering, or full-stack development roles.
  - Strong hands-on experience with frontend development using
    React or similar modern frameworks.
  - Experience building backend APIs using Python
    (FastAPI/Flask).
  - Hands-on experience containerizing applications using
    Docker.
  - Experience deploying applications using Snowflake Snowpark
    Container Services (SPCS).
  - Strong experience building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines
    (GitHub Actions preferred).
  - Strong understanding of Git workflows, version control, and
    release management best practices.
  - Experience building and deploying multi-service applications
    in cloud environments.
  - Understanding of secure authentication, secrets management,
    and enterprise access control.
  - Ability to independently own and deliver end-to-end
    application deployments.
  - Strong debugging and troubleshooting skills across frontend,
    backend, and infrastructure layers.
  
  Nice to Have:
  
  - Experience building AI-powered internal tools, copilots, or
    enterprise dashboards.
  - Experience integrating with enterprise platforms such as
    Slack, Salesforce, Workday, Netsuite, or similar SaaS
    systems.
  - Familiarity with Snowflake data architecture and working
    with Snowflake-hosted APIs.
  - Experience implementing automated testing frameworks across
    frontend and backend systems.
  - Experience with observability tools or cloud-native
    monitoring platforms.
  - Understanding of multi-tenant SaaS deployment models.
  - Experience working in compliance-heavy or public sector
    environments.
  - Experience collaborating with cross-functional stakeholders
    and participating in agile delivery processes.
