  will architect context-aware, tool-using AI agents that
  operate reliably within Government Community Cloud High
  (GCCH) and federally compliant environments.
  
  You will work at the intersection of LLM orchestration,
  contextual engineering, secure data access, and cloud-native
  software development, translating mission and business
  requirements into production-grade AI systems.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  Agentic AI & Contextual Engineering
  
  - Design and implement multi-step, agentic AI workflows
    (planner/executor, tool-using agents, RAG + memory
    patterns)
  
  - Engineer robust contextual pipelines including:
  
  - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
  
  - Structured memory (short-term, long-term, episodic)
  
  - Tool invocation and function calling
  
  - Control hallucination, drift, and overreach through
    grounding, validation, policy constraints, and ensemble
    methods.
  
  - Optimize context windows, token usage, and latency under
    federal cost, platform quotas, and performance
    constraints.
  
  Secure Software Development
  
  - Build production-grade services using Python, Java, C++,
    Rust, GO, C#, TypeScript
  
  - Implement APIs and microservices that integrate AI agents
    with:
  
  - Data lake house
  
  - SharePoint
  
  - Microsoft Graph API
  
  - Line-of-business systems
  
  - Apply secure coding practices aligned with NIST 800-53 /
    800-171
  
  Azure GCCH and Federally Compliant Architecture
  
  - Design and deploy solutions in GCCH environments
  
  - Work within constraints such as:
  
  - Limited model availability
  
  - Restricted outbound network access
  
  - Controlled identity and authentication flows
  
  - Use Azure services including:
  
  - Azure AI (OpenAI / Foundry where applicable)
  
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
  
  - Azure Functions / App Services
  
  - Azure Data Lake Storage
  
  - Azure Key Vault
  
  - Implement identity, RBAC, and managed identities aligned
    with federal requirements
  
  Compliance, Governance, and Safety
  
  - Design AI systems with auditability, traceability, and
    explainability
  
  - Support Authority to Operate (ATO) processes
  
  - Implement logging, monitoring, and human-in-the-loop
    controls
  
  - Ensure data residency, data minimization, and model usage
    compliance
