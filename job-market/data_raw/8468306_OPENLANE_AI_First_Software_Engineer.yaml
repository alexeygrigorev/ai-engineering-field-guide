  Who We Are:
  
  At OPENLANE we make wholesale easy so our customers can be
  more successful.
  
  We’re a technology company building the world’s most
  advanced—and uncomplicated—digital marketplace for used
  vehicles.
  
  We’re a data company helping customers buy and sell smarter
  with clear, actionable insights they can understand and use.
  
  And we’re an innovation company accelerating the future of
  wholesale remarketing through curiosity, collaboration, and
  an entrepreneurial spirit.
  
  Our Values:
  
  Driven Waybuilders. We pursue challenges that inspire us to
  build, create, and innovate.
  
  Relentless Curiosity. We seek to understand and improve our
  customers’ experience.
  
  Smart Risk-Taking. We transform risk into progress through
  data, experience, and intuition.
  
  Fearless Ownership. We deliver what we promise and learn
  along the way.
  
  
  We’re Looking For:
  
  We’re hiring AI-first Software Engineers to build, evolve,
  and scale OPENLANE’s U.S. marketplace platforms.
  
  These roles are for engineers who already treat AI as a
  first-class development tool, not a novelty. You’ll use AI
  to move faster, ship higher-quality software, and reduce
  operational and development toil, while still applying
  strong engineering judgment, ownership, and systems
  thinking.
  
  You’ll work on customer-facing marketplace experiences and
  core platform services, partnering closely with Product,
  Data, Infrastructure, and SRE teams to deliver resilient,
  scalable systems.
  
  AI is an accelerator. Engineering ownership still matters.
  
  Why OPENLANE:

  - AI-forward. You already use AI tools to enhance development
    speed, quality, and efficiency, and you continuously adapt
    as tooling evolves.
  - Product-minded. You think beyond code and understand how
    technical decisions impact customers and business
    outcomes.
  - Ownership-driven. You take responsibility for systems end-
    to-end, including reliability and operational health.
  - Technically curious. You enjoy learning new technologies and
    thoughtfully evaluating emerging approaches.
  - Quality-focused. You value clean, maintainable code, strong
    testing practices, and production-ready engineering
    standards.
