  About Distyl AI
  
  Distyl AI develops production-grade AI systems to power core
  operational workflows for Fortune 500 companies. Powered by
  a strategic partnership with OpenAI, in-house software
  accelerators, and deep enterprise AI expertise, we deliver
  working AI systems with rapid time to value – within a
  quarter.
  
  Our products have helped Fortune 500 customers across
  diverse industries, from insurance and CPG to non-profits.
  As part of our team, you will help companies identify,
  build, and realize value from their GenAI investments, often
  for the first time. We are customer-centric, working
  backward from the customer’s problem and holding ourselves
  accountable for creating both financial impact and improving
  the lives of end-users.
  
  Distyl is led by proven leaders from top companies like
  Palantir and Apple and is backed by Lightspeed, Khosla,
  Coatue, Dell Technologies Capital, Nat Friedman (Former CEO
  of GitHub), Brad Gerstner (Founder and CEO of Altimeter),
  and board members of over a dozen Fortune 500 companies.
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  We’re hiring AI Engineers at all levels of experience, from
  early-career builders to senior engineers who can lead
  large-scale deployments and shape our customers' technical
  roadmap. Regardless of seniority, every AI Engineer at
  Distyl is a hands-on contributor responsible for designing,
  implementing, and deploying production-grade AI systems
  using Large Language Models (LLMs).
  
  At the most senior levels, our engineers operate as the
  technical owners of F500 engagements, defining architecture,
  engaging with enterprise leaders, and leading technical
  teams to transform mission-critical workflows.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  All AI Engineers at Distyl are expected to:
  
  - Design and Deploy LLM-Powered Systems: Build and deploy
    robust GenAI systems that deliver measurable business
    value. Includes model evaluation, prompt design,
    agent/agentic logic, and full-stack application
    development
  - Engage Deeply with Customers: Work directly with customer
    stakeholders to understand their most pressing business
    and technical needs, and turn those into tailored, high-
    impact AI solutions
  - Build and Improve Our Platform: Contribute to the
    development of Distillery, our internal LLM application
    platform, by developing reusable tools, infrastructure,
    and workflows that scale across customers
  - Deliver Production Quality: Ensure systems are observable,
    maintainable, and meet rigorous reliability, performance,
    and security standards
  - Evaluate AI Systems Scientifically: Lead evaluation efforts
    balancing accuracy, latency, explainability, cost, and
    robustness
  - Continuously Improve: Refine development workflows, platform
    architecture, and deployment practices to raise the
    engineering bar
  
  At higher levels of experience, you will also:
  
  - Set technical direction and architecture for multi-million-
    dollar customer engagements
  - Earn executive trust and guide enterprise engineers through
    rollout and long-term operations
  - Mentor and up-level Distyl engineers via design reviews,
    architectural design reviews, leading by doing, and
    targeted coaching
  
  Who You Are
  
  We believe great AI Engineers come from diverse backgrounds
  and are unified by deep curiosity, pragmatism, and
  engineering excellence. We’re excited to meet candidates
  with:
  
  - Proficiency in Python or Typescript (experience with a
    diverse set of languages is a plus), with hands-on
    experience using LLM tooling such as LangChain,
    LlamaIndex, Guardrails, MCP and Agents SDK
  - Experience building and deploying LLM-powered AI agents in
    production, including tool use, prompt orchestration, RAG,
    and long-horizon task execution
  - Deep understanding of agent design patterns, with practical
    experience in observability, debugging, and human-in-the-
    loop feedback systems
  - Skilled at solving complex, ambiguous problems using
    cutting-edge AI techniques to deliver meaningful business
    outcomes
  - Familiar with responsible AI practices (e.g., auditability,
    interpretability), and experienced in aligning AI systems
    with enterprise-grade requirements
  - Comfortable working across cloud environments (AWS, GCP,
    Azure) with modern DevOps tools (Docker, CI/CD), and
    collaborating closely with cross-functional teams
  - For senior roles: strong architectural and systems design,
    experience leading projects, navigating and deploying into
    enterprise hybrid cloud environments and mentor others
  
  What We Offer
  
  - The base salary range for this role is $130K – $250K,
    depending on experience, location, and level. In addition
    to base compensation, this role is eligible for meaningful
    equity, along with a comprehensive benefits package
  - 100% covered medical, dental, and vision for employees and
    dependents
  - 401(k) with additional perks (e.g., commuter benefits,
    in‑office lunch)
  - Access to state‑of‑the‑art models, generous usage of modern
    AI tools, and real‑world business problems
  - Ownership of high‑impact projects across top enterprises
  - A mission‑driven, fast‑moving culture that prizes curiosity,
    pragmatism, and excellence
  
  Distyl has offices in San Francisco and New York. This role
  follows a hybrid collaboration model with 3+ days per week
  (Tuesday–Thursday) in‑office..
