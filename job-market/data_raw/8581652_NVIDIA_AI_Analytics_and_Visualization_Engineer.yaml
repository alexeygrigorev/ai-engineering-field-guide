  NVIDIA’s SCG - Silicon Co-Design Group, Efficiency (SSGE)
  team is seeking a full-stack developer passionate about
  building automation and resourceful workflow tools that
  streamline complex engineering and business processes. You
  will develop and maintain intelligent workflows that
  leverage LLMs and automation frameworks to orchestrate data
  collection, decision-making, and actions across systems,
  while also building robust data pipelines and interactive
  interfaces where needed. You will partner closely with other
  teams to understand their workflows and turn them into AI-
  powered agents and tools using modern frameworks and
  technologies. At NVIDIA, we strive for perfection, encourage
  innovation, and provide opportunities to explore new ways to
  succeed!
  
  What you'll be doing:
  
  - Build and run AI agent workflows involving LLMs and tools to
    automate multi-step processes.
  - Build orchestration services that coordinate model calls,
    tools, and human review.
  - Develop APIs that expose AI agents to internal apps and UIs
    or equivalent experience.
  - Connect existing ETL and data pipelines as tools and context
    for agents.
  - Construct simple web or chat interfaces for workflows
    powered by artificial intelligence.
  - Ensure scalability, performance, and security of AI services
    and data flows.
  
  What we need to see:
  
  - MS or equivalent experience.
  - 5+ years of full-stack development.
  - Strong Python skills with a track record of building APIs
    and backend services.
  - Proficient with SQL and relational or NoSQL databases, plus
    data modeling and workflow automation.
  - Familiar with LLM platforms and agent/tool frameworks, and
    able to turn sophisticated workflows into usable AI tools.
  - Expertise in Jira, Perforce, and Git-based platforms, with
    the technical ability to harness APIs for data retrieval
    and integration.
  - Excellent problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and a
    collaborative approach.
  
  Ways to Standout from the crowd:
  
  - Skilled in deploying AI services on AWS, Azure, or GCP with
    Docker or Kubernetes.
  - Experience with event-driven or streaming systems (e.g.,
    Kafka, Kinesis).
  - Expertise in dashboarding tools (e.g., PowerBI, Grafana, or
    EasyBI).
  - Hands-on use of AI development tools (e.g., Cursor,
    Copilot).
  - Experience leveraging AI tools or large language models
    (LLMs) to enhance productivity, automate workflows, or
    improve data-driven decision-making.
