  Why We Need You:
  
  Our team is at the forefront of building AI-powered
  developer tools that transform how engineering teams work
  across Citi. From release automation and CI/CD modernization
  to source control migrations (BitBucket to GitHub
  Enterprise) and innovative AI utilities, we are solving
  complex challenges at scale. As we expand our portfolio of
  tools, we need a skilled Python developer who can build
  robust backend services, integrate cutting-edge AI
  capabilities, and collaborate closely with users to drive
  adoption. Your work will directly impact thousands of
  developers across Citi, helping them modernize their
  workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and leverage AI to
  boost productivity.
  
  About the Role:
  
  We are seeking a Senior Python Developer to own and maintain
  AI-powered developer tools across multiple domains including
  release automation, source control migration, CI/CD
  modernization, and AI innovation. You will work on backend
  services that leverage Generative AI to automate complex
  workflows, configuration transformations, and code
  generation. Beyond development, you will actively
  collaborate with users and encourage adoption of these tools
  across the organization.
  
  Key Responsibilities:
  
  - Own and maintain Python-based services built with FastAPI
    and Uvicorn across multiple tool domains.
  - Develop AI-powered features for release automation,
    migration utilities (e.g., BitBucket to GitHub
    Enterprise), and developer productivity tools.
  - Integrate with LLM/Gen AI services for intelligent code
    analysis, transformation, and automation.
  - Build and maintain REST APIs that serve frontend
    applications and integrate with enterprise systems.
  - Work with databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or similar) for
    storing and querying metadata.
  - Proactively identify, assess, and remediate CVEs/CVMs in
    Python dependencies, ensuring timely resolution.
  - Implement async/await patterns for efficient API handling
    and rate limiting strategies.
  - Write and maintain unit tests using pytest and perform load
    testing with Locust.
  - Support Kubernetes/Helm-based deployments across DEV, UAT,
    COB, and PROD environments.
  - Collaborate with engineering teams to understand their needs
    and gather feedback for tool improvements.
  - Actively encourage and support users in adopting AI-powered
    tools through demos, office hours, and hands-on
    assistance.
  - Contribute to AI innovation initiatives, exploring new use
    cases and proof-of-concepts.
  - Ensure code quality through Black, isort, and SonarQube
    compliance.
  
  Required Skills:
  
  - 5-6 years of professional experience in Python development.
  - Strong proficiency in FastAPI or similar async web
    frameworks (Flask, Django REST).
  - Experience with asynchronous programming (asyncio,
    async/await patterns).
  - Solid understanding of RESTful API design and
    implementation.
  - Experience with NoSQL or relational databases (MongoDB,
    PostgreSQL, or similar).
  - Familiarity with LLM/Gen AI integration concepts and
    willingness to innovate with AI.
  - Experience with template engines (Jinja2) for code/config
    generation.
  - Proficiency in YAML/JSON processing.
  - Experience with containerization (Docker) and basic
    Kubernetes/Helm knowledge.
  - Strong testing skills with pytest.
  - Excellent collaboration and communication skills with
    ability to work closely with end users.
  - Proactive mindset in encouraging tool adoption and providing
    user support.
  - Experience with Git version control (GitHub, BitBucket) and
    PR-based workflows.
  
  Preferred Skills:
  
  - Experience with Google Cloud Platform, Vertex AI, or similar
    AI/ML platforms.
  - Knowledge of CI/CD concepts, release automation, and DevOps
    practices.
  - Experience with source control migrations (BitBucket,
    GitLab, GitHub Enterprise).
  - Familiarity with OIDC/OAuth authentication.
  - Experience with rate limiting and retry patterns for API
    integrations.
  - Understanding of prompt engineering for LLM applications.
  - Experience conducting technical demos or training sessions.
  
  Nice to Have:
  
  - Experience with LLM evaluation frameworks.
  - Hands-on experience with enterprise CI/CD platforms.
  - Experience working in financial services or regulated
