  WHO WE ARE 🌍
  
  We help creators get more out of every conversation with
  Instagram-focused automations and support for other channels
  like Messenger, WhatsApp, and TikTok. The result? Better
  engagement, more sales, and real, sustainable growth.
  
  With a diverse team of 350+ people across three continents,
  we’re building the leading Chat Marketing platform — trusted
  by more than 1.5 million customers worldwide. AI is one of
  our top strategic priorities. We’re building intelligent,
  production-grade systems that power conversations at scale —
  and we’re just getting started.
  
  WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR 🌟
  
  We’re hiring a Senior Python Engineer to help build
  Conversational AI inside Manychat — a production system that
  enables creators to manage high-volume Instagram
  conversations at scale. This team is solving that problem by
  building AI-powered experiences that help creators respond
  faster, convert more leads, and focus on growing their
  business. Your work will directly influence how
  conversations turn into measurable business outcomes.
  
  This role is ideal for someone who thrives in high-load,
  real-world backend environments and enjoys tackling the
  practical challenges of production AI: reliability, latency,
  observability, quality control, and safe behavior at scale.
  You take ownership, think in systems to turn ambiguity into
  shipped, impactful solutions.
  
  YOUR FUTURE TEAMMATES 👋
  
  Meet the AI team:
  
  We build AI systems from the ground up — not research silos,
  but production-ready services that power Manychat at scale.
  Our strong Python foundation fits naturally into a high-
  load, product-driven environment.
  
  We collaborate closely with AI Experts, Product Managers,
  Designers — contributing to architecture, delivery, and
  reliability decisions that drive speed, stability, and
  impact.
  
  WHAT YOU'LL DO 🚀
  
  - Design, build, and scale AI-powered backend services
    embedded directly into the Manychat platform.
  - Architect scalable, async Python services operating in high-
    load, production environments.
  - Integrate LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure-hosted models, etc.)
    with a strong focus on reliability, latency, and cost-
    efficiency.
  - Design and maintain internal and external APIs, ensuring
    scalability and resilience.
  - Own features end-to-end — from discovery and technical
    design through production deployment, monitoring, and
    iteration.
  - Make architectural decisions that balance speed,
    scalability, and long-term maintainability.
  - Ensure production reliability through strong observability
    practices (monitoring, logging, alerting).
  - Implement and maintain high-quality unit and integration
    test coverage.
  - Contribute to CI/CD pipelines and continuously improve
    release processes.
  - Collaborate cross-functionally with Product, Design, AI
    experts, and Platform teams in a Scrum environment.
  - Connect engineering decisions to measurable product and
    business impact.
  
  TO SHINE IN THIS ROLE 💥You’ll need:
  
  - 5+ years of commercial Python development in production
    environments.
  - Strong expertise in modern Python frameworks (FastAPI
    preferred; Django/Flask acceptable).
  - Solid experience designing and integrating APIs (including
    third-party services).
  - Strong understanding of async programming and concurrency
    (AsyncIO, non-blocking I/O).
  - Experience working with PostgreSQL and large datasets.
  - Experience building and maintaining high-load backend
    systems.
  - Strong testing practices (unit and integration tests; PyTest
    preferred).
  - Experience with CI/CD pipelines and Docker.
  - Strong ownership and product mindset — able to align with
    stakeholders and connect engineering work to business
    impact.
  
  It would be great if you have:
  
  - Experience integrating LLMs or AI/ML features into
    production systems.
  - Understanding of AI/ML concepts applied in real-world
    products.
  - Experience with cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
  - Experience with containerization (Docker).
  - Familiarity with observability tools (Grafana, Prometheus).
  - Experience with Meta or TikTok APIs.
  - Exposure to distributed systems architecture.

  - 🌍 Hybrid onboarding to start remotely and relocation support
    for you and your family.
  - 💙 Comprehensive health insurance for you and your family.
