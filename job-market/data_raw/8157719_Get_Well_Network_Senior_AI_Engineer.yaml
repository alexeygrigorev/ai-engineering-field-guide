  Opportunity
  
  Get Well is seeking a talented and innovative Senior AI
  Engineer to lead the development and deployment of advanced
  AI solutions within a mission-driven healthcare environment.
  This role is ideal for a seasoned professional with hands-on
  experience in machine learning (ML), large language models
  (LLMs), and generative AI (GenAI), with a strong focus on
  productionizing scalable and reliable models.
  
  As a Senior AI Engineer, you will drive end-to-end AI
  development—from ideation and training data pipelines to
  model deployment and continuous improvement—while addressing
  unique healthcare data challenges. You’ll collaborate across
  functions including product, engineering, data science, and
  clinical experts to deliver high-impact AI applications,
  including voice assistants and multimodal systems tailored
  to real-world care settings.
  
  ResponsibilitiesAI Model Development & Customization
  
  - Fine-tune LLMs and ML models for healthcare-specific use
    cases.
  - Build multimodal AI systems that integrate text, structured
    medical data, and images.
  - Optimize models for accuracy, latency, and resource
    efficiency in production settings.
  - Evaluate and integrate speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-
    speech (TTS) models into conversational interfaces.
  - Customize foundation models using domain adaptation and
    prompt engineering techniques (e.g., PEFT, LoRA).
  - Develop AI algorithms from healthcare data and guide them
    through a full production lifecycle into deployed
    solutions.
  
  Productionization & Deployment
  
  - Lead model deployment end-to-end with cloud-native tools and
    infrastructure (Azure ML).
  - Implement model performance monitoring, drift detection, and
    auto-retraining pipelines.
  - Ensure AI solutions are scalable, reliable, and aligned with
    security and compliance requirements in healthcare
    environments.
  
  Technical Leadership
  
  - Provide technical guidance to junior AI engineers.
  - Conduct design reviews and drive the adoption of best
    practices in model reproducibility, validation, and
    explainability.
  - Lead the evaluation and integration of cutting-edge ML
    research and open-source frameworks.
  - Contribute to architectural decisions aligned with clinical,
    business, and regulatory goals.
  
  Data Engineering & Management
  
  - Process and curate large-scale, structured and unstructured
    healthcare datasets.
  - Design synthetic data generation strategies where needed to
    augment training.
  - Handle noisy, imbalanced, or incomplete data through robust
    preprocessing and enrichment.
  - Ensure HIPAA and GDPR compliance in data handling,
    encryption, and access management.
  - Leverage EHR and clinical data from the provider side to
    engineer healthcare data pipelines and training corpora.
  
  Bias Mitigation, Evaluation & Governance
  
  - Lead the creation of robust evaluation strategies combining
    domain-specific KPIs (e.g., AUC, accuracy) with clinical
    relevance.
  - Proactively identify, measure, and mitigate algorithmic
    bias, especially in patient-facing models.
  - Conduct adversarial stress testing and ensure models meet
    safety, fairness, and ethical standards.
  - Define model KPIs aligned with measurable impacts on
    clinical outcomes, patient safety, and workflow
    efficiency.
  
  Cross-Functional Collaboration
  
  - Translate stakeholder and product needs into robust,
    scalable AI solutions.
  - Collaborate with clinical experts to vet model behavior and
    expected impact in patient and caregiver workflows.
  - Participate in Agile processes including sprint planning,
    demos, and technical retrospectives.
  - Manage documentation of model architectures, version
    changes, testing strategies, and key design decisions.
  
  Learning, Innovation & Thought Leadership
  
  - Stay up-to-date on the latest LLM advancements, STT/TTS
    developments, voice interaction technologies, and GenAI
    frameworks.
  - Evaluate new models and methods (e.g., RAG, LangChain,
    Whisper, Tacotron) for their potential impact and
    feasibility.
  - Advocate for responsible AI and lead initiatives in privacy-
    preserving and explainable ML.
  - Contribute to a culture of continuous learning, internal
    knowledge sharing, and open technical dialogue.
  
  QualificationsEducation & Experience
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science,
    Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or related
    technical field.
  - Minimum 6+ years of industry experience in AI/ML including
    at least 2 years with GenAI, NLP/NLU, and LLMs.
  - Must have software development experience at a healthcare
    company, particularly in the provider space (e.g.,
    hospitals, clinical systems) with exposure to EHRs or
    related healthcare data domains.
  - Proven experience developing AI algorithms using healthcare
    datasets and integrating them into production products or
    services.
  - Experience building voice-enabled products or assistants is
    highly advantageous.
  
  Technical Skills
  
  - Expert in Python and deep learning frameworks such as
    PyTorch or TensorFlow.
  - Hands-on experience with training/fine-tuning LLMs and
    modern NLP/NLU techniques.
  - Hands-on expertise with STT (e.g., Whisper) and TTS (e.g.
    Elevenlabs) models.
  - Proficient in MLOps, including model serving, experiment
    tracking, container orchestration, and CI/CD pipelines.
  - Strong understanding of production-grade solutions using
    Azure.
  - Familiarity with version control (e.g., Git), collaboration
    tools, and responsible AI practices.
  - Familiar with vector databases, retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG), and API deployment.
