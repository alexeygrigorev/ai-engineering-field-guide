  WHO WE ARE
  
  Zeta Global (NYSE: ZETA) is the AI-Powered Marketing Cloud
  that leverages advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and
  trillions of consumer signals to make it easier for
  marketers to acquire, grow, and retain customers more
  efficiently. Through the Zeta Marketing Platform (ZMP), our
  vision is to make sophisticated marketing simple by unifying
  identity, intelligence, and omnichannel activation into a
  single platform – powered by one of the industry’s largest
  proprietary databases and AI. Our enterprise customers
  across multiple verticals are empowered to personalize
  experiences with consumers at an individual level across
  every channel, delivering better results for marketing
  programs. Zeta was founded in 2007 by David A. Steinberg and
  John Sculley and is headquartered in New York City with
  offices around the world. To learn more, go to

  Role Description
  
  As a Principal AI/ML Engineer in our AdTech team, you will
  be a key individual contributor driving the development of
  advanced machine learning models and AI-driven features for
  our advertising platform. You will design, build, and deploy
  ML solutions for campaign optimization, user
  personalization, and creative content generation, operating
  at large scale and low latency to handle billions of ad
  events per day. This role requires deep expertise in machine
  learning techniques and the programmatic advertising
  ecosystem (e.g., real-time bidding and digital marketing
  data). You will work closely with engineering, product, and
  data science teams to ensure our ML systems are highly
  performant, scalable, and reliable. You will also spearhead
  innovation by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
  intelligent agent architectures to create new capabilities
  that automate and enhance advertising campaigns.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Machine Learning Leadership: Lead the design and
    implementation of scalable, high-performance, and
    resilient ML solutions for AdTech use cases. You will set
    technical direction for integrating AI/ML into our Demand-
    Side Platform and broader ad tech stack.
  
  - ML System Design: Architect and evolve the end-to-end
    machine learning pipeline – from data ingestion and
    training to real-time inference, for our real-time
    bidding, targeting, and optimization algorithms. Ensure
    that models seamlessly integrate with our ad serving
    architecture and handle low-latency, high-throughput
    requirements.
  
  - Technical Strategy: Define the technical roadmap and vision
    for AI/ML in our platform, evaluating new tools and
    techniques (including the latest in deep learning and
    LLMs) and making strategic build-vs-buy decisions.
    Continuously assess emerging technologies to keep our
    AdTech capabilities on the cutting edge.
  
  - AI & Agentic Applications: Develop intelligent systems using
    AI agents and agentic workflows to automate and optimize
    end-to-end campaign processes. Leverage LLMs and
    generative AI to enable autonomous campaign management
    tasks such as audience segmentation, dynamic bid
    adjustments, and creative asset generation.
  
  - Cross-Functional Collaboration: Partner with engineering,
    product, and data science teams to translate marketing
    objectives into ML-driven solutions. Work closely with
    stakeholders to deliver innovative features – including
    those powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), that
    enhance our advertising products.
  
  - Performance & Reliability: Ensure system robustness and
    stability for ML services in a high-concurrency, low-
    latency environment. Optimize algorithms and
    infrastructure for speed and scalability, and implement
    monitoring to maintain model performance and uptime in
    production.
  
  - Mentorship & Best Practices: Provide technical guidance and
    mentorship to other engineers and data scientists,
    fostering a culture of excellence in engineering and ML
    best practices. Review code and models, share knowledge,
    and champion continuous improvement across teams.
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  - 10+ years of experience in software engineering or data
    science, with at least 3-5 years in a principal engineer
    or lead ML role (preferably in the AdTech/MarTech
    industry).
  
  - Proven experience designing and building high-throughput,
    low-latency distributed systems or data pipelines for
    large-scale applications.
  
  - Deep expertise in the programmatic advertising ecosystem,
    including Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs), real-time bidding
    (RTB), Supply-Side Platforms (SSPs), and ad exchanges.
  
  - Proficiency in programming languages such as Java, Go, and
    Python for building both data-intensive backend services
    and ML tools.
  
  - Hands-on experience with machine learning frameworks and
    libraries, especially PyTorch or TensorFlow, for
    developing and training models.
  
  - Strong experience with big data and streaming frameworks
    (e.g., Apache Spark, Kafka, Hadoop) for processing and
    analyzing large datasets.
  
  - Expertise with cloud platforms (preferably AWS) and related
    services for scalable ML model deployment and data
    storage.
  
  - Experience with various data stores, including both SQL and
    NoSQL databases (e.g., MySQL/PostgreSQL, Cassandra,
    DynamoDB, Redis).
  
  - Familiarity with containerization and orchestration
    technologies (Docker, Kubernetes) for deploying and
    managing services at scale.
  
  - Excellent communication, presentation, and interpersonal
    skills, with ability to convey complex ML concepts to
    technical and non-technical stakeholders.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Experience with Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative
    AI applied to advertising, for example, using AI to
    generate ad copy, optimize creative content, or
    personalize messaging.
  
  - Experience designing and implementing agentic workflows that
    enable autonomous decision-making and real-time
    optimization in marketing campaigns.
  
  - Experience with machine learning model serving and
    optimization for real-time inference applications
    (latency-critical environments).
  
  - Familiarity with modern data lake and table formats (e.g.,
    Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi) for managing large-scale
    analytical datasets.
  
  - Knowledge of microservices architecture and event-driven
    design patterns in distributed systems.
  
  - A track record of contributions to open-source projects or
    speaking at industry conferences, demonstrating thought
    leadership in AI/ML.
  
  BENEFITS & PERKS
  
  - Unlimited PTO
  - Excellent medical, dental, and vision coverage
  - Employee Equity
  - Employee Discounts, Virtual Wellness Classes, and Pet
    Insurance And more!!
