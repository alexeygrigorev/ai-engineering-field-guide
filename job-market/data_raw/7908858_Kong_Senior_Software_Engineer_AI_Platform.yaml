  Are you ready to power the World's connections?
  
  If you don’t think you meet all of the criteria below but
  are still interested in the job, please apply. Nobody checks
  every box - we’re looking for candidates that are
  particularly strong in a few areas, and have some interest
  and capabilities in others.
  
  About the role:
  
  The Senior AI/ML Engineer will be a key contributor to
  Kong's AI Platform team, focusing on data pipelines,
  knowledge systems, and vector search infrastructure. You'll
  build the data foundation that powers our AI capabilities,
  including documentation ingestion, semantic search,
  embedding pipelines, and knowledge base management. This
  role requires expertise in vector databases, embedding
  models, document processing, and MLOps practices. You'll
  ensure our AI systems have access to high-quality, privacy-
  compliant data that enables accurate and relevant responses.
  
  What you'll do:
  
  - Design and implement documentation ingestion pipelines for
    AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base and other vector stores.
  - Build semantic chunking and document processing systems
    optimized for retrieval quality and context preservation.
  - Develop vector embedding pipelines with hybrid search
    strategies combining semantic and keyword search.
  - Create real-time telemetry collection systems for model
    monitoring, performance tracking, and quality assurance.
  - Implement data anonymization and PII detection systems to
    ensure privacy-compliant AI operations.
  - Build automated knowledge base refresh and quality
    monitoring systems for maintaining data freshness.
  - Design and implement feature stores for model inputs, prompt
    variables, and contextual information.
  - Develop training data curation pipelines for future fine-
    tuning and model improvement initiatives.
  - Optimize vector indexes and database performance for low-
    latency retrieval at scale.
  - Create metadata enrichment and entity extraction pipelines
    to enhance search relevance.
  - Build streaming data pipelines for real-time data ingestion
    and processing.
  - Collaborate with AI engineers to optimize retrieval
    strategies and improve RAG system performance.
  - Establish best practices for data quality, privacy
    compliance, and GDPR-compliant data handling.
  - Work with platform engineers to deploy and scale data
    infrastructure on AWS.
  
  What you'll bring:
  
  - 5+ years of professional software engineering experience
    with 4+ years focused on ML/AI engineering and data
    pipelines.
  - Strong experience with vector databases such as Pinecone,
    Weaviate, Qdrant, OpenSearch, or similar technologies.
  - Deep knowledge of embedding models including OpenAI Ada-3,
    Cohere, BGE, E5, and understanding of when to use each.
  - Expertise in document processing, chunking strategies, and
    optimizing retrieval quality.
  - Proficiency in both Python (for ML workflows) and Go (for
    production systems).
  - Experience with MLOps tools and platforms such as Weights &
    Biases, MLflow, Kubeflow, or similar.
  - Strong knowledge of streaming data systems like Kafka,
    Kinesis, or similar technologies.
  - Understanding of GDPR, privacy regulations, and privacy-
    compliant data handling practices.
  - Experience with knowledge graphs, semantic technologies, or
    ontology management.
  - Background in information retrieval, search relevance, and
    ranking algorithms.
  - Experience with data transformation and ETL/ELT pipelines at
    scale.
  - Strong understanding of SQL and NoSQL databases for data
    storage and retrieval.
  - Knowledge of AWS data services (S3, DynamoDB, RDS, Kinesis,
    Glue).
  - Experience with experiment tracking and feature engineering
    for ML models.
  
  Bonus Points:
  
  - Experience with AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base or similar
    managed vector search services.
  - Knowledge of hybrid search algorithms combining dense and
    sparse retrieval.
  - Experience with reranking models and cross-encoders for
    retrieval optimization.
  - Familiarity with prompt compression and context window
    optimization techniques.
  - Experience with synthetic data generation for training and
    evaluation.
  - Knowledge of named entity recognition (NER) and information
    extraction systems.
  - Experience with graph databases (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) or
    knowledge graph construction.
  - Background in natural language processing (NLP) or
    computational linguistics.
  - Experience with data versioning tools (DVC, Pachyderm) and
    reproducible ML pipelines.
  - Knowledge of model serving infrastructure (Seldon, KServe,
    BentoML).
  - Experience with distributed computing frameworks (Spark,
    Ray, Dask).
  - Understanding of semantic similarity metrics and evaluation
    frameworks.
  - Experience with A/B testing frameworks and causal inference
    methods.
  - Familiarity with data governance and lineage tracking tools.
  - Contributions to open-source ML/data engineering projects.
  - Experience with Kubernetes and containerized data pipelines.
