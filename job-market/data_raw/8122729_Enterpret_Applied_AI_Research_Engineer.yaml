  About Enterpret Enterpret is redefining how businesses
  understand and act on customer feedback. We are building an
  AI-native platform that centralises feedback from every
  source surveys, reviews, support tickets, communities and
  turns it into clear, actionable insights that drive business
  growth. We are trusted by some of the world’s most customer-
  obsessed companies like Canva, Descript, Notion, Perplexity
  and many more, and backed by leading investors like Kleiner
  Perkins, Canaan Partners, and Peak XV Partners. Our mission:
  to unlock the voice of the customer for every product team
  on the planet. About the Role This is a hands-on role for
  someone who’s equally strong in research thinking and
  engineering execution. You will define what “good” looks
  like for AI-powered features, build systems that meet that
  bar, and own them through launch and beyond. From writing
  eval plans to debugging failures in production, you will
  work across the stack and across functions to ship reliable,
  high-quality LLM-driven systems. What You Will Do ? You will
  design, build & ship AI-backed features that are reliable in
  production
  
  - Define the quality bar: design eval rubrics, test plans, and
    rollout criteria. Make sure they’re measurable and
    enforced.
  - Build with real-world constraints: write and extend
    production code, set up monitoring, and add tests that
    catch regressions before users do.
  - Own features end to end from problem framing to modeling,
    from system design to rollout and iteration.
  - Debug failures across the stack including data, infra,
    model, prompt logic and harden the system with what you
    learn.
  - Design and implement systems: retrieval pipelines, agents,
    or hybrid patterns, based on what the problem actually
    needs.
  - Work across functions: collaborate with product, infra, and
    engineers to ship features that actually stick.
  
  What It Takes ? You have built and shipped AI systems before
  and carried the load when things broke post-launch.
  
  - Strong research instincts: you are good at defining what
    “working” means and designing evaluations that reflect
    real-world usage.
  - Solid engineering skills: you write clean, testable Python,
    debug at system boundaries, and know your way around
    production stacks.
  - LLM understanding: you have worked with modern models and
    know how to prompt, fine-tune, or wrap them with tooling
    and evaluation.
  - Systems mindset: you think in interfaces, data contracts,
    failure modes, and rollout plans, not just model tweaks.
  - Practical bias: you care more about what ships and survives
    than what’s novel.
  - Ownership: you take initiative, communicate clearly, and
    push for quality without being asked.
  
  Why Enterpret?
  
  - We build AI systems that people can trust because they have
    been tested, monitored, and hardened through real usage.
  - We care deeply about quality. Eval plans, incident retros,
    and per-tenant guardrails aren't checkboxes, they're the
    core of how we build.
  - We believe research belongs in production, not just papers.
    You will see your ideas live in running systems within
    weeks, not years.
  - We are small enough that every engineer matters, and focused
    enough that there's no busywork, just high-impact
    problems.
  - You will be part of a team that runs toward hard, ambiguous
    challenges and sees them through to working, reliable
    systems.
  - There is no playbook here, we are writing it as we go. If
    that excites you, not scares you, you will thrive here.
