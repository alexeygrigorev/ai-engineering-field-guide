  Ambrook’s mission is to help family-run American businesses
  become more profitable and resilient.
  
  Operators across American agriculture and industry face
  increasing pressure from record-breaking droughts, rising
  input costs, and unpredictable markets. The best long-term
  investments, like efficient irrigation and grazing
  rotations, support both the land and the bottom line. But
  even when the payoff is clear, these changes need upfront
  capital and financial clarity that's hard to come by.
  
  Business owners work with fragmented records and outdated
  tools. They can't easily see what's working or prove
  viability to a lender, partner, or the next generation.
  
  Ambrook is rebuilding the financial infrastructure that
  independent operators rely on.
  
  We replace paperwork and legacy systems with modern tools
  for accounting, banking, invoicing and spending. Tools built
  for people who spend more time in the field than in the
  office. Our platform gives producers the financial clarity
  they need to make confident investments in their land, their
  operation, and their future.
  
  Our customers are the backbone of the real economy. They are
  stewards of land, labor, and legacy. We're giving them the
  ability to invest in stronger, more durable businesses. When
  they do, they build generational resilience across America.
  
  We started with farmers and ranchers across the country. Now
  we're expanding quickly to other American industries.
  
  We're a Series A startup backed by top investors like Thrive
  Capital, Dylan Field, Homebrew, Designer Fund, and BoxGroup.
  We're looking for early team members who want to untangle
  the knotted intersection between American industry, climate,
  and the economy.
  
  The opportunity
  
  Ambrook is building a world-class team to empower industrial
  businesses using modern AI tools. As one of our first
  engineers focused on AI and machine learning, you’ll help
  lay the foundation for how we use LLMs and intelligent
  systems to make messy, high-stakes financial workflows
  faster, smarter, and more accessible for farmers and
  ranchers.
  
  We’re dealing with problems like the messy inbox problem,
  cleaning and categorizing transactions, summarizing
  financial documents, and surfacing the right insights at the
  right time — and we need an engineer who’s excited to build
  AI-powered tools that actually work in the wild.
  
  We’re looking for someone who we can count on to…
  
  - Own: Development of intelligent systems and tools that use
    LLMs, NLP, and heuristics to streamline bookkeeping, inbox
    triage, and financial workflows.
  - Teach: Best practices around ML system design, evaluation,
    prompt engineering, and scalable AI infrastructure.
  - Learn: How messy real world financial data really is - from
    scanned PDFs to unformatted CSVs to text-heavy emails -
    and how to make sense of it using language models.
  - Improve: Our internal tooling and infrastructure for
    classification, tagging, summarization, and user-in-the-
    loop AI systems.
  
  Within 1 month you'll...
  
  - Build and ship a feature powered by an LLM - e.g., parsing a
    new type of paper document, or categorizing financial
    transactions.
  - Review our current uses of AI and write up a note
    identifying where AI could meaningfully improve automation
    and accuracy.
  - Collaborate with product and engineering to understand
    customer workflows and where AI would reduce manual pain.
  
  Within 3 months you'll...
  
  - Establish early foundations for evaluation pipelines, prompt
    management, and feedback loops to improve LLM performance
    over time.
  - Implement or improve systems for document extraction and
    financial transaction tagging, using both heuristics and
    model-based approaches.
  - Collaborate closely with design and product to make AI
    features feel reliable, intuitive, and helpful, not
    mysterious or brittle.
  
  Within 6 months you'll...
  
  - Architect and scale systems for automated bookkeeping and
    analysis using hybrid AI + rule-based systems.
  - Contribute to our long-term AI strategy: which tasks to
    automate, how to measure confidence, and when to keep a
    human in the loop.
  - Help build internal tooling for prompt iteration, embedding
    search, labeling, and retraining.
  - Share learnings in a post on Ambrook Research or an open-
    source tool that helps others tackle similar messy real-
    world data problems.
  
  About you
  
  - You've built and shipped ML/AI-driven features, ideally with
    LLMs, in a product that’s in production, not just in a
    notebook.
  - You're excited to apply language models to real-world,
    unstructured, often ugly datasets, and turn them into
    valuable product experiences.
  - You're pragmatic about AI: you know when to use an LLM, when
    to write a regular expression, and when to ask the user.
  - Bonus: Experience working with LLM APIs, prompt engineering,
    embeddings, vector search, or fine-tuning.
  - Bonus: You've worked on products involving transactions,
    finance, document processing, or communications tooling.
  - Bonus: Experience with Typescript, React, and Python-based
    ML tooling (LangChain, OpenAI SDK, Pinecone, etc.).
