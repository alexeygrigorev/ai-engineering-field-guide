  Company Overview
  
  At Skild AI, we are building the world's first general
  purpose robotic intelligence that is robust and adapts to
  unseen scenarios without failing. We believe massive scale
  through data-driven machine learning is the key to unlocking
  these capabilities for the widespread deployment of robots
  within society. Our team consists of individuals with
  varying levels of experience and backgrounds, from new
  graduates to domain experts. Relevant industry experience is
  important, but ultimately less so than your demonstrated
  abilities and attitude. We are looking for passionate
  individuals who are eager to explore uncharted waters and
  contribute to our innovative projects.
  
  Position Overview
  
  We are looking for a Software Engineer to work at the
  forefront of deploying our cutting-edge AI models, enhancing
  the performance and capabilities of our embodied systems.
  You will be responsible for optimizing AI inference
  processes from lightweight to billion-parameter models,
  ensuring our robots operate with unmatched efficiency and
  intelligence in real-world environments. You will work at
  the intersection of systems and machine learning, directly
  contributing to making our AI models more powerful and
  adaptive by ensuring consistent performance in light of
  variable and perhaps unforeseen compute and hardware
  constraints.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Develop and optimize runtime AI inference pipelines for
    real-world robotic deployment.
  - Build infrastructure, frameworks, and tooling to enable
    reliable integration of models into robotic systems and
    informative analysis of production models to drive the
    direction of architecture choice and deployment system
    design.
  - Formulate specialized optimization solutions for various
    inference paradigms and scenarios (autoregressive models,
    denoising models, hierarchical models, state machines,
    multi-agent systems, cloud-based inference).
  - Adapt optimization solutions to various compute, hardware,
    and networking constraints.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - BS, MS or higher degree in Computer Science, Robotics,
    Engineering or a related field, or equivalent practical
    experience.
  - Minimum of 3 years of industry experience.
  - Proficiency developing in low-level systems languages (C,
    C++, Rust, Go), Python and at least one deep learning
    library such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, etc.
  - Deep understanding and practical experience with low-level
    systems concepts (multithreading, networking, embedded
    systems, memory management).
  - Experience with CUDA.
  - Deep understanding of state-of-the-art machine learning
    techniques and models.
  - Experience optimizing various machine learning
    architectures.
  - Experience with machine learning compilers.
  - Experience optimizing model inference for robotic systems
    deployment.
