  About the Bletchley Fellowship
  
  The Bletchley Fellowship is a work-integrated fellowship
  program designed to align how technologists learn with how
  modern AI products are actually built and deployed.
  
  Rather than treating education and employment as separate
  phases, the Fellowship intentionally combines structured
  learning with real, paid work on production systems. Fellows
  are placed with vetted employer partners while progressing
  through a rigorous curriculum focused on AI/ML and Data
  Science.
  
  The Fellowship exists for engineers who want to deepen their
  technical range, work on meaningful systems, and develop
  real responsibility earlier and more deliberately than
  traditional career paths allow.
  
  About Flatiron School
  
  As a leader in the tech industry, Flatiron School believes
  that education is the best investment you can make in your
  future. We’re committed to helping change lives and the
  world for the better. Our courses provide an immersive,
  outcomes-driven curriculum for students looking to launch a
  career in Software Engineering, Cybersecurity, Data Science,
  Artificial Intelligence and Game Design. In addition to
  student programs, we also offer targeted education solutions
  for organizations.
  
  About the Opportunity
  
  Flatiron School is offering an apprenticeship opportunity
  for early-career developers to earn income while learning.
  Apprentices will enroll in Flatiron’s AI part-time bootcamp
  and be matched with one of Bletchley Fellowship’s employer
  partners for a paid apprenticeship throughout the duration
  of your course.
  
  This is a unique opportunity to develop skills in AI and
  data science while gaining hands-on industry experience. As
  an apprentice, you’ll contribute to software products,
  collaborate with experienced engineers, and build your
  portfolio with production-ready work. At the same time,
  you’ll deepen your understanding of data and machine
  learning to become a more versatile, full-stack software
  developer.
  
  This is a full-time opportunity, 40 hours/week (20 hours
  coursework and 20 hours apprentice work) for 14 months. The
  apprenticeship earnings will more than cover the tuition
  cost of the bootcamp.

  - Attend and complete the Flatiron School Data Science
    Bootcamp as part of the apprenticeship
  - Contribute to software projects for your host company
  - Write clean, maintainable and testable code using modern
    frameworks and tools
  - Collaborate in sprint-based workflows and participate in
    code reviews
  - Support feature development, debugging, documentation, and
    QA processes
  - Build your portfolio of production-level work while growing
    your technical and collaborative skills
  - Receive ongoing mentorship from senior developers and
    product leaders
  
  What you'll learn
  
  - How engineering and data science intersect in modern AI
    products
  - Practical agile development workflows in a collaborative
    environment
  - Best practices for writing clean, maintainable, production-
    quality code
  - How to build and ship features with real user needs and
    product strategy in mind
