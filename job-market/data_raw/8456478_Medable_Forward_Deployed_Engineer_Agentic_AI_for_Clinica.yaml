description: |
  Medable's mission is to get effective therapies to patients
  faster. We provide an end-to-end, cloud-based platform with
  a flexible suite of tools that allows patients, healthcare
  providers, clinical research organizations and
  pharmaceutical sponsors to work together as a team in
  clinical trials. Our solutions enable more efficient
  clinical research, more effective healthcare delivery, and
  more accurate precision and predictive medicine. Our target
  audiences are patients, providers, principal investigators,
  and innovators who work in healthcare and life sciences.
  
  Our vision is to accelerate the path to human discovery and
  medical cures. We are passionate about driving innovation
  and empowering consumers. We are proactive, collaborative,
  self-motivated learners, committed, bold and tenacious. We
  are dedicated to making this world a healthier place.
  
  1. Responsibilities
  
  - Lead technical engagements with prospective and existing
    customers, acting as the primary solution consultant,
    technical advisor, and embedded engineer for agentic AI
    and agent system deployments.
  - Partner directly with customer stakeholders—from clinical
    operations, data science, and IT teams to C-level
    executives—to scope requirements and deploy agentic AI
    systems that enable autonomous clinical development
    workflows with built-in human oversight.
  - Design, architect, and implement tailored solutions
    integrating Medable’s platform with eClinical systems
    (EDC, eCOA, CTMS, RTSM/IWRS), enterprise environments, and
    agentic AI frameworks to build autonomous systems powered
    by agent systems for end-to-end trial automation.
  - Demonstrate Medable capabilities through live demos,
    technical deep dives, proof-of-concepts, and production
    deployments of agentic AI, showcasing autonomous agents,
    reasoning loops, multi-agent orchestration, and goal-
    driven adaptation in clinical contexts.
  - Build, deploy, and optimize agentic AI and agent systems in
    regulated environments, enabling autonomous capabilities
    such as real-time patient matching, adaptive protocol
    execution, predictive risk mitigation, automated data
    reconciliation, and trial simulation—while enforcing
    human-in-the-loop safeguards (supervision loops, safety
    gates, audit trails, and escalation protocols).
  - Incorporate robust human-in-the-loop systems throughout
    agentic deployments, including intervention points,
    validation workflows, and hybrid decision-making to
    maintain compliance, ethical standards, and human
    accountability in autonomous clinical operations.
  - Wrangle large-scale clinical, real-world, and operational
    data to power agentic AI reasoning and agent coordination,
    accelerating autonomous insights while ensuring seamless
    integration with human review processes.
  - Develop custom integrations, APIs, configurations, and
    tooling to support agentic AI autonomy and agent system
    interoperability, addressing customer-specific needs like
    decentralized trial flows or adaptive designs.
  - Troubleshoot and refine agentic AI deployments on-site or
    remotely, optimizing for scalability, reliability, low-
    latency reasoning, and effective human-AI collaboration in
    production clinical environments.
  - Collaborate with product, engineering, and go-to-market
    teams to relay field insights from agentic AI deployments,
    prioritizing features for autonomous clinical systems with
    human safeguards, and influencing roadmap decisions.
  - Contribute to RFPs, technical proposals, solution designs,
    and executive presentations highlighting the
    transformative impact of agentic AI and agent systems in
    enabling autonomous yet compliant clinical development.
  - Drive adoption, quantify impact (e.g., reduced enrollment
    timelines, minimized protocol deviations, improved data
    integrity), and expand customer relationships to support
    revenue growth and sustained success.
  - Other duties as assigned in a fast-evolving, AI-driven
    environment.
  
  2. Experience
  
  - 6+ years of hands-on experience in technical consulting,
    solution engineering, forward deployed engineering, or
    implementation roles—ideally in life sciences, clinical
    research, health tech, or regulated AI-intensive
    industries (or equivalent combination of education and
    experience).
  - Proven track record deploying agentic AI systems and agent
    systems, including autonomous agents, goal-oriented
    reasoning, multi-agent orchestration, adaptive planning,
    tool-use integration, and iterative execution in complex,
    dynamic environments.
  - Extensive experience designing and deploying regulated
    agentic AI with strong governance, auditability,
    compliance (e.g., GCP, 21 CFR Part 11, GDPR), and human-
    in-the-loop mechanisms to enable safe autonomous clinical
    development workflows (e.g., automated monitoring,
    adaptive trials, real-time decision support).
  - Demonstrated expertise in agent systems and agentic AI
    patterns—such as reasoning loops, multi-agent
    collaboration, retrieval-augmented execution, and
    guardrail frameworks—applied to clinical or life sciences
    use cases.
  - 1+ years of post-college software engineering experience
    with end-to-end ownership in high-stakes, dynamic projects
    involving AI agent deployments.
  - Strong background in enterprise integrations, cloud
    platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP), APIs, data pipelines, modern
    architectures, and large-scale data handling to support
    agentic AI autonomy.
  
  3. Skills
  
  - Deep expertise in eClinical technologies (EDC, eCOA, CTMS,
    RTSM/IWRS) and interoperability standards (e.g., FHIR,
    CDISC, HL7), with proven ability to integrate them into
    agentic AI-driven autonomous systems.
  - Proficiency in technical platform implementation for
    building, deploying, and orchestrating agent systems and
    agentic AI automations.
  - Strong knowledge of data structures, storage systems, cloud
    infrastructure, front-end frameworks, and AI tooling
    (e.g., LLMs, vector databases, agent frameworks) for
    reasoning, planning, and multi-agent coordination.
  - Exceptional ability to translate complex agentic AI and
    autonomous system concepts into clear business value for
    clinical stakeholders.
  - Outstanding communication, presentation, relationship-
    building, and stakeholder management skills across
    technical and executive levels.
  - Highly analytical mindset with eagerness to solve ambiguous,
    high-impact problems using agentic AI in regulated
    clinical settings.
