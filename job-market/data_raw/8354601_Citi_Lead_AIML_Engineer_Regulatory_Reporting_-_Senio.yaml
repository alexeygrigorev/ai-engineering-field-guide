  Role Summary: We are establishing a specialized AI/ML team
  in Mumbai to modernize our Regulatory Reporting function. We
  are looking for a hands-on technical leader to build and
  deploy two classes of solutions: (1) Anomaly Detection
  Models to catch data quality issues before they reach the
  regulators, and (2) GenAI Workflows (LLMs/Agents) to
  automate manual reconciliation and document reviews.
  Crucially, you will solve the "Validation Bottleneck." You
  will design "Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL) workflows that make
  it easy for business users to validate model outputs against
  legal loan documents, bridging the gap between "Black Box"
  AI and auditable regulatory standards.
  
  
  Key Responsibilities: •  Build unsupervised and semi-
  supervised ML models (e.g., Isolation Forests, Autoencoders)
  to scan millions of transactional records for outliers. •
  The Challenge: Go beyond simple "threshold checks." Detect
  complex patterns (e.g., "This trade structure looks valid in
  isolation but is anomalous for this specific counterparty
  type"). •Reduce false positives to ensure the Reporting Team
  trusts the model alerts. •Design RAG (Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation) pipelines to "chat" with unstructured data
  (Credit Agreements, Loan Docs) and extract key regulatory
  attributes (Maturity Dates, Collateral Clauses). •Build
  "Agentic" workflows where GenAI proactively suggests mapping
  logic or identifies the root cause of a break, requiring
  only a "thumbs up/down" from the human SME. •This is a
  critical success factor. You must build "Explainability"
  (XAI) into every model. You cannot just output a score; you
  must output why (e.g., "Flagged because this value is 3x
  higher than the historical average for this product").
  •Create Validation Interfaces: Build simple UIs (using
  Streamlit or React) where business users can see the Model's
  Prediction side-by-side with the Source Document to rapidly
  approve/reject the finding. •Work with Model Risk Management
  (MRM) to establish a "fast-track" validation framework for
  non-deterministic GenAI models. • Hire and mentor a squad of
  4-5 junior data scientists/engineers in Mumbai. •Act as the
  "AI Evangelist" to the Operations/Finance teams,
  demonstrating how AI assists them rather than replacing
  them.
  
  Requirement:  • Core ML: 8+ years in Data
  Science/Engineering. Deep experience with Scikit-learn,
  TensorFlow, or PyTorch. • GenAI Stack: Hands-on experience
  with LLM orchestration frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex)
  and Vector Databases (Pinecone, Milvus, or pgvector). •The
  "Validation" Stack: Experience building tools like Streamlit
  or Gradio for rapid prototyping of human-review interfaces.
  •Experience in Financial Services (specifically Fraud
  Detection, AML, or Risk Modeling). •Able to communicate and
  explain "Hallucination Risk" to a non-technical Chief Risk
  Officer?
