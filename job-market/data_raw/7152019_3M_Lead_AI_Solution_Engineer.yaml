  The Impact You’ll Make in this Role
  
  As a Lead AI Solution Engineer, you will be a strategic and
  technical driver of 3M’s enterprise AI initiatives, guiding
  cross-functional teams to design, build, and scale cutting-
  edge AI solutions. Your role goes beyond engineering—you
  will set the vision, mentor teams, ensure governance, and
  deliver high-value AI outcomes aligned with business goals.
  
  Here, you will make an impact by:
  
  Key Responsibilities:
  
  - Leading AI Solution Development: Drive the design,
    development, and deployment of AI/ML and Generative AI
    solutions, ensuring scalability, security, and performance
    across global environments.
  - Establishing Best Practices: Define standards for
    LLMOps/MLOps, model lifecycle management, governance, and
    compliance while embedding responsible AI principles.
  - Building High-Performance Teams: Lead, mentor, and upskill
    engineers, data scientists, and architects; foster an
    innovation-driven culture with measurable impact.
  - Driving Generative AI Adoption: Develop and deploy agentic
    AI systems, RAG pipelines, vector databases, and AI
    orchestration frameworks that integrate seamlessly into
    enterprise workflows.
  - Owning Governance & Compliance: Implement robust security,
    privacy, and ethical AI practices; enforce policies for
    model explainability, drift monitoring, and lineage
    tracking.
  - Innovating Continuously: Evaluate and adopt emerging AI
    technologies (LLMs, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, vector
    DBs) and run proof-of-concept initiatives to keep 3M ahead
    of the curve.
  - Partnering Across the Enterprise: Act as the AI thought
    leader, collaborating with business stakeholders, cloud
    architects, and product teams to deliver transformative
    solutions.
  
  To set you up for success in this role from day one, 3M
  requires (at a minimum) the following qualifications:
  
  - Bachelor's degree or higher in Computer Science,
    Engineering, or related field (completed and verified
    prior to start).
  - 9+ years of experience in AI/ML engineering, data science,
    or platform leadership roles, including 3+ years in a
    leadership capacity.
  - Strong expertise in MLOps and LLMOps, with hands-on
    experience using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Airflow,
    MLflow, LangChain, or Semantic Kernel.
  - Deep experience in cloud ecosystems (AWS or Azure) and
    working knowledge of multi-cloud integration.
  - Proven track record of delivering production-grade AI
    systems, including model deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and
    infrastructure automation (Terraform, Bicep,
    CloudFormation).
  - Certified AWS Cloud Solutions Architect
  
  Additional qualifications that could help you succeed even
  further in this role include:
  
  - Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related
    field.
  - Strong understanding of LLMs and Generative AI frameworks,
    vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, OpenSearch),
    and prompt engineering techniques.
  - Experience in AI product development and scaling AI
    applications in enterprise environments.
  - Excellent leadership, communication, and collaboration
    skills, with the ability to influence at all levels of the
    organization.
