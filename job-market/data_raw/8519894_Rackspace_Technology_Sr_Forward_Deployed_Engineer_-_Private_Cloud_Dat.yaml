  (IC)
  
  As a Sr. Forward Deployed Engineer (Sr. FDE) at Rackspace
  Technology, you will be embedded directly with our most
  strategic enterprise customers to architect, build, and
  deploy high-impact AI solutions. This role combines deep
  technical engineering with business acumen, customer
  empathy, and end-to-end solution ownership. You become the
  technical bridge between Rackspace’s AI platform
  capabilities and the customer’s most pressing business
  challenges. You will own the full solution lifecycle from
  problem discovery and rapid prototyping through production
  deployment and continuous optimization while feeding field
  insights back to our product and platform engineering teams.
  
  
  
  This role is ideal for someone who thrives at the
  intersection of engineering, strategy, and customer
  engagement and wants the autonomy and impact typically found
  at an AI startup, backed by the scale and resources of a
  global technology company.
  
  Key Accountabilities:
  
  - Embed with strategic enterprise customers to rapidly
    diagnose critical business challenges, map data
    landscapes, and co-design AI solutions on-site.
  - Lead end-to-end solution design and delivery of agentic AI
    workflows, RAG pipelines, knowledge graphs, and real-time
    decision-making applications.
  - Drive rapid prototyping and POCs that demonstrate tangible
    business value within days to weeks.
  - Serve as the primary technical owner across the full project
    lifecycle: scoping, architecture, build, deployment, and
    post-launch optimization.
  - Architect production-grade Enterprise AI applications on
    Partner Foundry Solutions or Rackspace Private Cloud and
    GPU infrastructure, integrating with enterprise systems
    (ERP, CRM, data warehouses, data lakes).
  - Build scalable data pipelines across structured and
    unstructured data using ETL/ELT, vector databases
    (Pinecone, Weaviate, AstraDB), and knowledge base
    frameworks.
  - Develop and fine-tune LLM/SLM solutions; implement RAG
    architectures (LlamaIndex, Haystack) and orchestrate
    multi-agent workflows (LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI).
  - Ship with full-stack and DevOps depth: Python, Node.js/Go,
    React/Vue, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and GPU cluster
    management.
  - Champion observability, monitoring, and telemetry to ensure
    trustworthy, auditable, and versioned AI agents in
    production.
  - Identify expansion opportunities by working with sales and
    customer success to uncover high-value use cases across
    new business domains.
  - Feed structured field insights back to Platform Engineering
    and Product on feature gaps, emerging needs, and usability
    improvements.
  - Build reusable IP through reference architectures,
    accelerators, frameworks, and technical best practices
    that scale future engagements.
  - Mentor engineers and customer teams, driving knowledge
    transfer and building internal AI competencies.
  
  Preferred Qualifications:
  
  - Experience with Palantir Foundry, AIP, ontology modeling,
    Uniphore BAIC, or similar Enterprise AI development
    platforms.
  - Knowledge of SLM fine-tuning, model distillation, RLHF, and
    AI evaluation frameworks.
  - Experience building agentic AI solutions: multi-agent
    systems, tool use, and autonomous workflow orchestration.
  - Familiarity with GPU infrastructure (NVIDIA H100/B200,
    InfiniBand) and private cloud platforms (OpenStack,
    VMware).
  - Foundry certifications from Palantir/Uniphore or AI/ML-
    related certifications.
  - Prior experience in technology consulting, AI startups, or
    Forward Deployed / Solutions Engineering roles.
  - Domain expertise in financial services, healthcare, supply
    chain, defense, energy, or manufacturing.
  - Experience with knowledge graphs, semantic modeling, and
    ontology-driven data management.
  
  Required Qualifications:
  
  - BS/MS/PhD in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering,
    Mathematics, Physics, or related field.
  - 10+ years in software engineering, data engineering, or
    AI/ML delivery; at least 4+ years in customer-facing or
    field roles.
  - Proven track record in building and deploying AI/ML
    applications in production at enterprise scale.
  - Deep full-stack proficiency: Python (required), Node.js/Go,
    React/Vue, SQL/NoSQL databases.
  - Hands-on with LLMs, prompt engineering, vector databases,
    data pipelines, application dashboards, RAG pipelines, and
    agent orchestration frameworks.
  - Strong DevOps skills: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, GPU
    infrastructure, cloud-native deployment patterns.
  - Experience integrating across heterogeneous enterprise
    systems - ERP, data warehouses, data lakes, streaming
    architectures.
  - Ability to translate ambiguous customer needs into
    actionable engineering plans under tight timelines.
