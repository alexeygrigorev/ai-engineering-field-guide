  About this role
  
  Business Overview
  
  PMGTech is the horizontal technology platform within
  BlackRock’s Portfolio Management Group (PMG), integrating
  investment research with advanced engineering, AI, and
  alternative data to make technology a direct driver of
  alpha. It operates as one global team across three verticals
  – Platform Strategy, Research Solutions (DS&S), and Platform
  Change (IPT) – partnering closely with the BlackRock Aladdin
  ecosystem and PMG investment leadership. This integrated
  model delivers a coherent tech strategy, strengthens the
  research community, and scales capabilities across regions,
  asset classes (Equities, Fixed Income, Multi-asset), and
  investment styles (discretionary and systematic).
  
  PMGTech leads PMG’s AI strategy by building an AI-ready
  research environment, unified data layer, agentic
  orchestration networks, and an investment-focused
  application layer to deploy AI-powered research solutions
  into production. As part of PMGTech, you will work directly
  with investment researchers and portfolio managers to build
  and scale capabilities in data engineering, GenAI, and
  platform tooling, streamlining research workflows and
  enabling differentiated, alpha-generative investment
  insights across PMG’s investment pillars.
  
  
  
  Job Purpose / Background
  
  DS&S envisions the AI Lead Engineer role as an investor-

  applications that integrate seamlessly into investor
  research workflows.
  
  AI Lead Engineers will sit within DS&S pods - asset-class
  focused sub-teams - and collaborate directly with investors
  across Portfolio Management Group (PMG) to understand
  business requirements, map research workflows, identify
  opportunities for AI leverage, and translate them into
  intuitive, scalable, production–grade research applications.
  
  AI Lead Engineers will own the technical vision, design,
  architecture, and product experience of specific research
  apps, partnering with Research Engineers, Engineering Hub
  and Platform to ensure these applications are robust,
  usable, and aligned with investor objectives.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Design architectures for AI-powered research applications
    leveraging Generative AI capabilities (RAG, agentic

    questions into feasible AI-driven product concepts.
  
  - Be hands-on in leading the lifecycle from POC to MVP to
    production for AI applications, including data pipelines
    and backend integration.
  
  - Own the end-to-end user experience of investor-facing
    research apps, including intuitive front-end UI designs.
  
  - Evaluate emerging models and APIs; define best practices for
    prompts, safety, reliability, and testing with internal
    and external tech teams.
  
  - Leverage enterprise data engines, orchestration frameworks,
    and secure/observable production practices with
    Engineering Hub and Platforms.
  
  - Implement monitoring, observability, evaluation frameworks,
    and data-quality safeguards for GenAI-powered research
    applications.

    to-end - including LLM workflows, prompt engineering, RAG
    pipelines, entity extraction, embeddings/vector search,
    text2sql, fine-tuning, evaluation, and backend integration
    using Python and SQL.
  
  - Strong written and oral communication skills and ability to
    work directly with investors and senior partners is a
    must.
  
  - Domain specific experience is a plus - building data-driven
    / research applications for investment research,
    investment management or financial services.
  
  - Hands-on experience with any major cloud platform,
    proficiency in front-end or full-stack development is a
    plus.
