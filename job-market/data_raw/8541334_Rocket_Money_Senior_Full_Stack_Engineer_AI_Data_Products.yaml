  ABOUT ROCKET MONEY 🔮
  
  Rocket Money’s mission is to meaningfully improve the
  financial prosperity of millions of people. Rocket Money
  offers members a unique understanding of their finances and
  a suite of valuable services that save them time and money –
  ultimately giving them a leg up on their financial journey.
  
  ABOUT THE TEAM 🤝
  
  On Team Intel, our mission is to take complex financial data
  and provide magical, data- and AI driven experiences to our
  millions of users. We’re a small but high-impact team where
  engineers are empowered to be co-owners of every step of the
  ideation → deployment lifecycle. Because of this structure,
  engineers on Team Intel must care deeply about our users and
  combine technical + creative energy to build brilliant
  products that make their financial lives easier and better.
  If you are an AI/ML-passionate software engineer, this is an
  incredible opportunity to be positioned to grow your
  capabilities in this skill set.
  
  IN THIS ROLE, YOU'LL:
  
  - Work on a cross-functional team of software engineers, ML
    engineers, and product managers to implement full-stack,
    user-facing features at the core of Rocket Money
  - Implement AI/LLM/ML tools our ML engineers are building (and
    if you’re willing, contribute to the building of them
    yourself!)
  - Develop with TypeScript across the Node.js, GraphQL, and
    PostgreSQL stack - mostly shipping backend features, but
    also at times building user interfaces using React in
    order to own the full-stack and experiment quickly
  - Own complex features end-to-end, from initial product &
    technical design stages through to production, ensuring
    the appropriate engineering rigor has been applied for
    scalability, reliability, and observability
  - Help to maintain our high technical bar, participating in
    code reviews and design discussions to ensure that we're
    applying appropriate rigor to our software development
    process
  - Support a collaborative and innovative culture by sharing
    your ideas via RFCs, participating in solution ideation,
    and giving your peers thoughtful feedback on their code
    and their proposals
  
  ABOUT YOU 🦄
  
  - You have 5+ years of professional experience working with
    some combination of Node.js/TypeScript, React (or similar
    framework), and Postgres (or similar relational database).
    - Experience with GraphQL is a plus: it’s what we use.
    - Experience with Python is a plus: it’s what the ML engineers
      we work with use.
    - Experience with training/tuning ML/AI models is a plus:
      software engineers on this team can certainly contribute
      in this arena.
    - Experience with ops/infra is a plus: we have a great infra
      team, but the more we contribute to shipping, the better
      it is for us.
  - You are curious/interested in machine learning and the
    rapidly-evolving world of AI, and are excited about the
    opportunity to work side-by-side with ML engineers and
    help ship ML products to users.
  - You're not just interested in what you're building, but also
    why you're building it. You have a drive to ship product
    that deeply matters to users.
  - You get energized by complex problem spaces with many edge
    cases. You love distilling ambiguity into tractable todos.
    Personal finance has a LOT of data-variability - building
    elegant features that work for everyone is not for the
    faint of heart!
  - You love continual evaluation & improvement and enjoy
    ideating on how to launch a v1 with a feedback loop as the
    means of training a brilliant v2. You have the same
    mentality about yourself and love giving & receiving
    feedback.
