  Why should you be part of our success story?

  diverse and inclusive global economy. In 2024 alone, we paid
  $11.2 billion to workers in nearly 100 currencies and
  provided healthcare and benefits to workers in 109
  countries—ensuring people get paid and protected, no matter
  where they are.
  
  Our momentum is reflected in our achievements and customer
  satisfaction: CNBC Disruptor 50,  Forbes Cloud 100, Deloitte
  Fast 500, and repeated recognition on Y Combinator’s top
  companies list – all while maintaining a 4.83 average rating
  from 15,000 reviews across G2, Trustpilot, Captera, Apple
  and Google.
  
  Your experience at Deel will be a career accelerator. At the
  forefront of the global work revolution, you'll tackle
  complex challenges that impact millions of people's working
  lives. With our momentum—backed by a $17.3 billion valuation
  and $1 B in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in just over five
  years—you'll drive meaningful impact while building
