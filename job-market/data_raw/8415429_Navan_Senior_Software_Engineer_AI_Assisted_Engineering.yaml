  About the Role
  
  We believe that Software Engineering is the highest-leverage
  human workflow in the company. In an AI-native world, the
  bottleneck is no longer how fast we can type, but how
  quickly we can validate, iterate, and deploy. Engineering
  excellence is our ultimate competitive advantage. As a
  Senior Software Engineer for AI Assisted Engineering
  Support, you will build the "intelligence layer" for our
  development teams. You aren't just building tools; you are
  building agents that understand our codebase, our standards,
  and our intent. Your goal is to move the company toward a
  "Demo to Prod" reality where AI handles the boilerplate, the
  testing, and the initial PR generation, leaving humans to
  focus on architecture and high-level logic.
  
  Consistent with our "Human Centric Workflows" philosophy,
  you will treat LLMs as programmable functions grounded in
  our specific codebase. You will build the specialized
  assistants that integrate into our IDEs and CI/CD pipelines
  to unblock developers, automate reviews, and ensure that
  "gold-standard" code is the default, not the exception.
  
  What you'll do
  
  - Build AI Engineering Assistants: Develop and scale the
    internal agents that assist with code generation,
    automated refactoring, and documentation.
  - Enable the "Demo to Prod" Pipeline: Work on the technical
    implementation of tools that allow for one-shot
    workflows—moving from a prototype or a spec directly to a
    production-ready Pull Request.
  - Deterministic Engineering Evals: Drive quality by
    prioritizing determinism. You will build the serialization
    formats and retrieval systems (RAG) that give engineering
    agents the exact context they need from our repositories
    to be precise and useful.
  - Automated Code Stewardship: Create agents that help maintain
    our "Immune System"—automated drift detection, visual
    regression testing, and security scanning for AI-assisted
    contributions.
  - Systemic Optimization: Implement a culture of rigour. You
    will run experiments across different models and tools,
    using engineering-specific benchmarks to ensure our
    assistants are actually increasing velocity and quality.
  - Global Collaboration: Partner with the US and Israel-based
    teams to integrate your assistants into our global
    developer platform and telemetry frameworks.
  
  What we're looking for
  
  - The "Developer's Developer": You are a Senior Software
    Engineer who loves building tools for other engineers. You
    understand the pain points of the modern development
    lifecycle and want to solve them with AI.
  - An Agentic Systems Specialist: You are experienced in
    building agentic flows (using state machines or agent
    frameworks) and know how to balance agency (allowing the
    tool to solve the problem) with precision (ensuring it
    doesn't break prod).
  - The "Data-First" Builder: You recognize that an AI assistant
    is only as good as the context it receives. You are
    skilled at data engineering and know how to serialize
    complex codebases for LLM consumption.
  - The "Moat" Builder: You see engineering velocity as a
    strategic differentiator. You are driven by the goal of
    making our engineering org so fast and reliable that we
    out-innovate the market.
  
  This is a high-impact implementation role. You will be
  shipping code that your teammates use every single day.
  You’ll spend your time building IDE extensions, automating
  PR cycles, and ensuring that our AI-native operating model
  delivers a level of engineering speed that is fundamentally
  unreachable by traditional teams.
