    feasibility.
  - Develop and deploy pilot agents, including two small and one

    metrics.
  - Ensure secure and compliant agent development by working
    with InfoSec, Legal, and Risk teams to define guardrails
    and data access policies.
  - Support change management efforts including training,
    documentation, and knowledge transfer to internal teams.
  - Contribute to the creation of reusable development patterns
    and performance monitoring frameworks for future agent
    deployments.
  - Participate in envisioning sessions, co-development sprints,
    and stakeholder demos to drive adoption and executive
    alignment.
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  - 5+ years of experience in enterprise application

  - Proven experience building and deploying AI agents or bots
    using Copilot Studio, Power Automate, or similar
    platforms.
  - Strong understanding of API integration, including RESTful
    services, OAuth2, and enterprise API gateways.
  - Familiarity with data governance, sensitivity labeling, and
    compliance frameworks in Microsoft 365.
  - Experience with asynchronous messaging systems (e.g., Kafka,
    AWS Queues) and internal API frameworks (e.g., C#-based).
  - Ability to work cross-functionally with business analysts,
    developers, and compliance teams.
  - Excellent communication skills and experience leading
    technical workshops or envisioning sessions.
