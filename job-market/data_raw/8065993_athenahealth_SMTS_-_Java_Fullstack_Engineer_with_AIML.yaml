  About athenahealth
  
  Our vision: In an industry that becomes more complex by the
  day, we stand for simplicity. We offer IT solutions and
  expert services that eliminate the daily hurdles preventing
  healthcare providers from focusing entirely on their
  patients — powered by our vision to create a thriving
  ecosystem that delivers accessible, high-quality, and
  sustainable healthcare for all.
  
  Our company culture: Our talented  employees — or
  athenistas, as we call ourselves — spark the innovation and
  passion needed to accomplish our vision. We are a diverse
  group of dreamers and do-ers with unique knowledge,
  expertise, backgrounds, and perspectives. We unite as
  mission-driven problem-solvers with a deep desire to achieve
  our vision and make our time here count. Our award-winning
  culture is built around shared values of inclusiveness,
  accountability, and support.
  
  Our DEI commitment: Our vision of accessible, high-quality,
  and sustainable healthcare for all requires addressing the
  inequities that stand in the way. That's one reason we
  prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion in every aspect
  of our business, from attracting and sustaining a diverse
  workforce to maintaining an inclusive environment for
  athenistas, our partners, customers and the communities
  where we work and serve.
  
  What we can do for you:
  
  Along with health and financial benefits, athenistas enjoy
  perks specific to each location, including commuter support,
  employee assistance programs, tuition assistance, employee
  resource groups, and collaborative  workspaces  — some
  offices even welcome dogs.
  
  We also encourage a better work-life balance for athenistas
  with our flexibility. While we know in-office collaboration
  is critical to our vision, we recognize that not all work
  needs to be done within an office environment, full-time.
  With consistent communication and digital collaboration
  tools, athenahealth enables employees to find a balance that
  feels fulfilling and productive for each individual
  situation.
  
  In addition to our traditional benefits and perks, we
  sponsor events throughout the year, including book clubs,
  external speakers, and hackathons. We provide athenistas
  with a company culture based on learning, the support of an
  engaged team, and an inclusive environment where all
  employees are valued.
