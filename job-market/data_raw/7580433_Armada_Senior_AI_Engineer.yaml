  for our clients in the US, Europe, the Middle East, and
  beyond. We are building a team of talented AI engineers who
  share a passion for creating transformative solutions. If
  you're excited about shaping the future with us, we would
  love to connect with you!
  
  About the Company
  
  Armada is an edge computing startup that provides computing
  infrastructure to remote areas where connectivity and cloud
  infrastructure is limited, as well as areas where data needs
  to be processed locally for real-time analytics and AI at
  the edge. We are unlocking the limitless potential of AI to
  transform operations and improve lives in some of the most
  remote locations on Earth. From the expansive mines of
  Australia to the oil fields of Northern Canada, and the
  coffee plantations of Colombia, Armada offers a unique
  opportunity to tackle exciting AI and ML challenges on a
  global scale.
  
  About the Role
  
  We’re looking to bring on the most brilliant minds to help
  further our mission of bridging the digital divide with
  advanced technology infrastructure that can be rapidly
  deployed anywhere. We are actively seeking passionate AI
  Engineers with hands-on expertise across a range of domains,
  including real-time computer vision, statistical machine
  learning, natural language processing, transformers, control
  and navigation, reinforcement learning, and large-scale
  distributed AI systems.
  
  Ideal candidates will possess strong skills in machine
  learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and real-time computer
  vision techniques. You will be responsible for building
  ML/DL models tailored to specific challenges, preparing
  datasets for testing, evaluating model performance, and
  deploying solutions in production environments. Familiarity
  with containerization, microservices architecture, and the
  ability to independently deploy ML models into production is
  essential.
  
  If you are a self-driven individual with a passion for
  cutting-edge AI, we want to hear from you. Armada offers an
  unparalleled opportunity to confront some of the most
  thrilling AI and ML challenges in the world. Join our
  dynamic AI Engineering team as we deliver disruptive edge-
  compute systems capable of autonomous learning, prediction,
