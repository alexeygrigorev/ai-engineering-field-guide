  Platform Strategy & Architecture
  
  - Lead the design, development, and evolution of internal
    developer platforms tailored for agentic AI use cases,
    focusing on self-service capabilities, intelligent
    automation, and an optimized developer experience for
    building and deploying AI agents.
  - Define architectural patterns and best practices for
    infrastructure, agent deployment and lifecycle management,
    and operational excellence, ensuring security,
    scalability, and cost-efficiency across agentic AI
    workloads.
  - Evaluate, select, and integrate foundational agentic AI
    technologies, including cloud-based agent orchestration
    frameworks, container orchestration (Kubernetes),
    infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools, agent workflow
    orchestration platforms, and observability solutions for
    agentic AI systems.
  - Drive the adoption of platform-as-a-service (PaaS),
    infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and agent-as-a-service
    principles to standardize and automate environment
    provisioning, agent training, and agent serving.
  
  Cloud Infrastructure & Agentic AI Operations
  
  - Architect, deploy, and manage core infrastructure and
    platform services on cloud platforms (GCP preferred),
    leveraging agentic AI and ML services such as Vertex AI,
    Compute Engine, GKE, and Cloud Storage.
  - Design and implement advanced networking, security controls,
    and access management (IAM) for agentic AI systems,
    supporting compliance and responsible AI guidelines.
  - Establish and manage comprehensive monitoring, logging,
    tracing, and alerting systems for agent workflows, models,
    and applications, ensuring the reliability, performance,
    and health of both platform and hosted agentic AI
    solutions.
  
  Developer Experience & Agentic AI Tooling
  
  - Build and maintain robust CI/CD and agentic AI pipeline
    automation (e.g., GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, Kubeflow, ArgoCD)
    for automated testing, deployment, release management, and
    agent lifecycle management.
  - Develop internal tools, APIs, and services that abstract
    agentic AI infrastructure complexity, enabling application
    and data science teams to self-service their agent/agent
    group training, deployment, and monitoring needs.
  - Champion best practices for code quality, testing, security
    scanning, and automated deployments, integrating agentic
    AI-assisted developer tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Claude
    Code, Gemini CLI) into platform offerings.
  - Provide guidance and support to engineering and data science
    teams on leveraging platform agentic AI capabilities to
    improve development workflows and operational posture.
  
  Backend Engineering for Agentic AI Platform Services
  
  - Develop scalable backend services and APIs using Python,
    specifically designed to power agentic AI platform
    functionalities and developer tools.
  - Design and implement REST-compliant or gRPC endpoints with
    versioning, comprehensive error handling, and clear
    documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger) for agentic AI
    platform services.
  - Architect database schemas and manage data persistence for
    platform metadata, agent artifacts, configuration, and
    telemetry data.
  - Build secure, high-performance services capable of handling
    demanding internal agentic AI platform workloads.
  
  Cross-Functional Collaboration
  
  - Partner closely with application, data science, security,
    and operations teams to understand agentic AI needs,
    gather feedback, and evolve the platform to meet
    enterprise requirements for agent-based solutions.
  - Contribute significantly to enterprise architectural
    decisions for agentic AI infrastructure and lead technical
    planning efforts for complex agentic AI platform
    initiatives.
  - Conduct thorough code and agent review, define platform
    engineering standards, and champion best practices for
    reliability, security, and operability of agentic AI
    systems across teams.
  - Clearly document platform architectures, agentic AI API
    specifications, runbooks, and critical technical decisions
    for knowledge sharing and maintainability.
