  Opportunity
  
  Get Well is seeking an innovative and technically skilled AI
  Engineer to join our growing team focused on building and
  deploying cutting-edge AI solutions in healthcare. You will
  work on developing production-ready AI systems with a deep
  focus on training and fine-tuning large language models
  (LLMs)—including unimodal and multimodal models—to solve
  complex domain-specific problems.
  
  This is an exciting opportunity to apply your machine
  learning and data science skills in a mission-driven
  environment to help improve precision care, patient
  engagement, and operational efficiency. You will collaborate
  across engineering, data, clinical, and product teams, and
  contribute throughout the entire AI lifecycle—from problem
  formulation and data engineering to model development and
  deployment.
  
  ResponsibilitiesAI Model Development & Deployment
  
  - Fine-tune and evaluate LLMs for real-world healthcare use
    cases.
  - Build multimodal AI systems that integrate text, structured
    medical data, and images.
  - Optimize models for accuracy, latency, and resource
    efficiency in production settings.
  - Evaluate and integrate speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-
    speech (TTS) models into conversational interfaces.
  - Customize foundation models using domain adaptation and
    prompt engineering techniques (e.g., PEFT, LoRA).
  - Develop and productionalize AI algorithms using healthcare-
    specific data sources, ensuring integration into clinical
    and operational products and services.
  
  AI Infrastructure & Implementation
  
  - Write clean, reusable code for model training, evaluation,
    deployment, and integration.
  - Maintain reproducibility, version control, and experiment
    tracking using industry best practices.
  - Implement continuous learning workflows using real-time
    feedback and retraining loops.
  - Build and support voice assistant applications for clinical
    or patient-facing use cases.
  
  Data Engineering for AI
  
  - Process and curate large-scale, structured and unstructured
    healthcare datasets.
  - Implement data privacy controls in compliance with HIPAA,
    GDPR, and internal policies.
  - Design synthetic data generation strategies where needed to
    augment training.
  - Handle noisy, imbalanced, or incomplete data through robust
    preprocessing and enrichment.
  
  Evaluation, Bias & Governance
  
  - Perform and validate evaluation benchmarks, and gold
    standard datasets.
  - Assess and address model bias, drift, explainability, and
    reliability.
  - Perform unit and integration testing for AI pipelines.
  - Apply responsible AI best practices and contribute to
    guidance on fairness, ethics, and safety.
  
  Collaboration & Agile Development
  
  - Participate in Agile workflows including daily stand-ups,
    sprint reviews, and retrospectives.
  - Document design, testing protocols, and implementation
    details.
  
  Learning & Innovation
  
  - Stay current on advances in GenAI, foundation models,
    STT/TTS technologies, and multimodal learning.
  - Evaluate emerging tools and frameworks (e.g., Hugging Face,
    LangChain, OpenAI) for platform integration.
  - Lead or contribute to knowledge-sharing discussions,
    internal demos, and architectural reviews.
  - Identify opportunities to improve scalability, safety, and
    impact of deployed AI systems.
  
  QualificationsEducation & Experience
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Machine
    Learning, Artificial Intelligence, or a related field.
  - 2+ years of hands-on experience in the end-to-end AI/ML
    development lifecycle.
  - Must have software development experience at a healthcare
    company, particularly in the provider space (e.g.,
    hospitals, clinical systems) with exposure to EHRs or
    related healthcare data domains.
  - Proven experience developing AI algorithms using real-world
    healthcare datasets and driving them through production
    pipelines into live products or services.
  - Experience with building voice assistants or conversational
    AI interfaces preferred.
  
  Technical Skills
  
  - Proficient in Python and ML frameworks such as PyTorch or
    TensorFlow.
  - Hands-on experience with training/fine-tuning LLMs and
    modern NLP/NLU techniques.
  - Prior work with speech processing models, including STT
    (e.g., Whisper, Elevenlabs) and TTS (e.g., Elevenlabs).
  - Familiar with vector databases, retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG), and API deployment.
  - Experience with Azure.
  - Understanding of evaluation techniques including BLEU,
    ROUGE, accuracy, recall, and human-in-the-loop validation.
  
  Professional Attributes
  
  - Curious and self-motivated, with a passion for impactful
    healthcare innovation.
  - Effective communicator who can tailor technical concepts to
    non-technical stakeholders.
  - Strong problem-solving skills and attention to
    reproducibility, safety, and compliance.
  - Willingness to work in a fast-paced, agile environment with
    cross-functional collaboration.
  - Working knowledge of privacy, ethics, and risk mitigation
    around AI and healthcare data.
  - Strong documentation habits and collaborative coding
    practices.
