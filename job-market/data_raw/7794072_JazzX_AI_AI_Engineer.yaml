  About JazzX AI:
  
  
  
  Vision: Enterprises operating on institutional
  intelligence—governed, self-improving, and scalable beyond
  individual expertise.
  
  JazzX AI is defining the future of enterprise work—by
  building AI-native digital workers that actually get the job
  done.
  
  
  
  We believe enterprises don't scale expertise—they lose it.
  Knowledge stays trapped in individuals, judgment gets
  applied inconsistently, and the best talent spends time on
  work that should run itself. We're changing that.
  
  JazzX AI transforms messy enterprise reality into
  institutional intelligence: governed digital workers that
  capture expert judgment, make every decision explainable,
  and continuously improve through real-world execution. The
  result is faster decisions, higher-quality outcomes, and
  reliable execution at scale—in domains where getting it
  wrong isn't an option.
  
  
  
  We're starting with lending and due-diligence
  workflows—complex, regulated, high-stakes. From here, we're
  building the backbone for enterprise intelligence across
  industries.
  
  
  
  This is early-stage, hard, and consequential work. If you
  want to be part of bringing AI systems to market that
  actually run in production, handle real complexity, and
  deliver real outcomes—not demos, not chatbots—JazzX AI is
  the place.
  
  Headquartered in Los Altos, CA. Backed by SAIGroup.

  Role Overview:
  
  As a Research Engineer, you will be instrumental in
  exploring and establishing best practices for leveraging and
  extending novel Generative AI based technologies to develop
  groundbreaking solutions for enterprise use cases. This role
  offers a unique opportunity to delve into the rapidly
  evolving world of foundation models, AI agents, reasoning
  models etc. and contribute to the design and development of
  an innovative enterprise AI platform to deliver
  transformative, AI-enabled work experiences for enterprise
  users.
  
  What You Will Do
  
  Experimentation and Research: Systematically explore various
  technologies and strategies such as foundation models,
  agentic workflows, ontology and knowledge graphs,
  reinforcement learning, dynamic prompting, retrieval
  augmented generation, and collaborative problem solving to
  enhance our understanding and utilization of foundation
  models and related Generative AI frameworks. You will design
  and conduct experiments to probe the limits and capabilities
  of different foundation models, frameworks and their
  application strategies.
  
  Development and Analysis: Design experiments to understand
  the capabilities and limits of foundation models. Build
  tools necessary for conducting experiments, run these
  experiments, and meticulously analyze the results. Build on
  the quantitative and qualitative findings from these
  experiments to design future experiments and shape the
  architecture of our enterprise AGI platform.
  
  Prototyping and Innovation: Take charge of developing and
  refining prototypes for our platform. Your innovative
  approach will contribute to evolving our enterprise AGI
  platform in line with the latest advancements and insights
  gained from research activities.
  
  Requirements
  
  - Proven hands-on experience prototyping advanced deep

    platforms, products and user experiences.
  - Hands-on experience working with AI foundation models (LLMs,
    reasoning models etc.) to craft real-world applications.
  - Comprehensive knowledge of the emerging AI ecosystem,
    including foundation model ecosystem (public and private
    models), agent frameworks, and tools.
  - Experience with AI Agent frameworks such as LangChain,
    AutoGen, CrewAI, or similar technologies.
  - Knowledge and/or experience with technologies like
    reinforcement learning and/or technologies like
    ontologies, knowledge graphs etc.
  - Ph.D/MS in AI/CS or related fields with a strong focus on
    AI/ML technologies.
  - At least 5 years of work experience in an applied AI science
    or AI engineering role within a science-driven product
    development context.
  - Strong quantitative and qualitative analytical skills.
  - A naturally curious mindset with a proactive approach to
