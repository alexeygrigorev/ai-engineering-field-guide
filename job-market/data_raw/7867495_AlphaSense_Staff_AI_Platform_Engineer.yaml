  About the Role
  
  AlphaSense is seeking an experienced engineering leader to
  transform how we build and operate AI-powered systems at
  scale. You'll join a team of brilliant engineers who've
  built cutting-edge AI applications, and your mission will be
  to bring world-class engineering practices that ensure these
  innovations run reliably for our enterprise customers.
  
  This is a unique opportunity for a seasoned engineer who
  thrives on building robust platforms, mentoring talented
  teams, and establishing engineering excellence. You'll have
  significant autonomy to shape our technical architecture
  while working with frontier AI models and agentic systems
  that power market intelligence for the world's leading
  companies.
  
  What You'll Do
  
  - Architect for Scale: Design and implement distributed
    systems that power AI agents processing thousands of
    requests per hour, ensuring reliability, performance, and
    cost-efficiency
  - Build Engineering Excellence: Establish comprehensive
    testing strategies, observability systems, and CI/CD
    pipelines that catch issues before customers do
  - Lead Through Expertise: Mentor a team of smart, motivated
    engineers, sharing your experience in building production
    systems that don't break at 3 AM
  - Drive Platform Evolution: Own the technical roadmap for our
    AI platform, making architectural decisions that will
    shape our systems for years to come
  - Bridge AI and Engineering: Collaborate with ML engineers and
    researchers to productionize cutting-edge AI capabilities
    while maintaining system stability
  
  What We're Looking For
  
  Required:
  
  - 8+ years building and operating distributed systems in
    production
  - Track record of improving system reliability (taking
    services from frequent outages to 99.9%+ uptime)
  - Deep expertise in modern engineering practices:
    microservices, containerization (Kubernetes),
    infrastructure as code
  - Experience leading technical initiatives and mentoring
    engineering teams
  - Strong coding skills with ability to work across the stack
  - Excellence in debugging production issues and implementing
    comprehensive observability
  - History of making pragmatic trade-offs between perfect and
    shipped
  
  Preferred:
  
  - Experience with LLM applications, agent frameworks, or AI/ML
    infrastructure
  - Familiarity with prompt engineering, RAG patterns, vector
    databases
  - Background at high-growth companies or modern engineering
    cultures
  - Experience with multi-model AI systems (OpenAI, Anthropic,
    Google, etc.)
  
  Impact You'll Have
  
  Within your first year, you'll transform how we build and
  operate software. You'll reduce incidents, establish testing
  and observability standards that become part of our DNA, and
  build platforms that enable other engineers to ship faster
  and safer. Most importantly, you'll elevate an entire team
  of engineers, sharing the expertise that only comes from
  years of building systems at scale.
