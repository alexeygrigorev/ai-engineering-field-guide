  About Bobsled
  
  Bobsled is building AI-powered analytics experiences that
  turn natural language into accurate, production-grade
  insights. Our mission is to enable enterprise customers to
  leverage the full power of AI and data agents, transforming
  how they access and act on their data. As we scale our AI
  product, we’re seeking hands-on specialists to ensure our
  customers’ deployments are robust, contextually tuned, and
  delivering measurable value.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Own the text-to-SQL accuracy problem end-to-end: design
    evals, iterate prompts, and improve retrieval/routing
  - Build and operate the experimentation and evaluation loop
    (automatic evals, regression suites, dataset curation)
  - Design pragmatic LLM application architectures (RAG, agent
    routing, tool-use orchestration) optimized for accuracy
    and latency
  - Ship production-grade code and support deployments;
    instrument, monitor, and troubleshoot model behavior in
    real customer environments
  - Partner closely with engineering and customers to improve
    semantic models, SQL generation, and data alignment
  - Create feedback loops from users to systematically capture
    issues and convert them into measurable improvements
  - Contribute to automation of environment provisioning and dev
    workflows to enable fast iteration
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - 2+ years in ML/AI or data-focused engineering or data
    science roles building production systems data or AI
    systems
  - Demonstrated experience tuning LLM applications: prompt
    engineering, evals, retrieval, agent design, or similar
  - Strong hands-on coding in Python or TypeScript (TypeScript
    familiarity a plus; willingness to work across the stack
    required)
  - ML engineering mindset beyond notebooks: testing, CI,
    observability, performance, and deployment in production
  - Comfort with SQL and complex data modeling; familiarity with
    data warehouses and pipelines
  - Pragmatic, product-oriented approach—optimize for impact
    over novelty; complement existing systems rather than
    rebuild from scratch
  - Ability to design experiments, quantify improvements, and
    communicate trade-offs clearly
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Experience with text-to-SQL systems, semantic layers, or
    BI/analytics workflows
  - Exposure to RAG frameworks, knowledge graphs, vector stores,
    and evaluation tooling
  - Prior work in analytics engineering or data engineering
    environments
  
  Success Looks Like
  
  - Measurable improvements in text-to-SQL accuracy across
    target datasets and partners
  - Reliable eval pipeline and regression suite running in CI to
    catch degradations
  - Clear architecture and documentation for context/agent
    systems that others can contribute to
  - Short feedback cycles with partners leading to fast,
    meaningful product wins
  
  Compensation
  
  - Competitive salary and meaningful equity
  - Comprehensive benefits
