  Who we are We’re GoSpooky: the ones who get all things
  social. A global agency made for the social era. We grow
  brands through content, community and commerce, keeping them
  at the forefront of culture. Social isn’t just first, it’s
  the foundation.
  
  From creatives and commerce specialists to game designers
  and data analysts, we cover the full social spectrum. If it
  shapes internet culture, we’re on it, making fast, bold and
  relevant work that actually gets shared.
  
  From TikToks that breaks the for you page, to creator
  stories built with real community insights, all the way to
  TikTok Shop, social affiliates and live social shopping that
  convert in real time.
  
  As official partners of Instagram and Snapchat and partners
  and social affiliates of TikTok (Shop), we work with brands
  like KLM, JBL, Samsung, Prime Video and HEMA. Driven by bold
  ambition, endless creativity and authentic people, our teams
  think ahead, react fast and keep brands culturally relevant.
  Whether it’s live social shopping, creator management,
  social-first campaigns or turning a trend into a brand
  moment.
  
  We’re always looking for fresh energy: people who bring new
  perspectives, challenge the norm and help us and our clients
  evolve. If you love shaking up social, thinking big and
  moving fast, you’ll fit right in.
  
  The Role
  
  As our Senior E2E AI Engineer, you are first and foremost
  experienced with dev work in production. You are not just
  prototyping in notebooks; you are architecting the end-to-
  end infrastructure, devops, and any necessary cloud or data
  engineering tasks that powers our next-generation AI tools.
  
  Your mission is to build the "pipes and plumbing" that make
  AI agents reliable, observable, and secure. You will own the
  full stack: from Data Engineering on BigQuery, to API
  development with FastAPI, to Model Serving on Vertex AI, and
  finally to DevOps/CI/CD pipelines that keep it all running.
  You sit at the intersection of Data/Software Engineering and
  AIOps.
  
  You will report to our AI Lead and work closely with the
  Data and Insights team and leaders across different business
  units.
  
  This role is part-time (24 - 32 hours per week)
  
  What you’ll do
  
  - Develop and deploy complex AI workflows (advanced RAG,
    multi-agent systems) integrated with core productivity
    tools
  - Build robust APIs and backends for RAG Pipelines and AI
    agents
  - Design and maintain scalable data pipelines for ETL,
    ingestion, and data preparation to ground models in high-
    quality data
  - Manage the testing deployment lifecycle, automating and
    versioning updates. Orchestrate models on Vertex AI (fine-
    tuning, serving, monitoring)
  - Implement AIOps and Agent Observability (tracing, logging,
    monitoring), while enforcing security for model inputs,
    outputs, and infrastructure
  
  What we’re looking for
  
  - 6+ years of professional software/data engineering
    experience, including at least 2 years of production-level
    hands-on experience in AI development/engineering
  - Proven experience with advanced RAG use cases, at least one
    major GenAI framework (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, or
    Heystack) plus one multi-agent framework (e.g., Langgraph,
    Google ADK, Vertex AI Agent Builder, or Microsoft Agent
    Framework)
  - Expert-level Python (or Typescript) skills. You write clean,
    modular, production-ready code. You are proficient with
    Pydantic (or an equivalent in Typescript) for validation
    and FastAPI for high-performance Async I/O
  - Essential expertise in Google Cloud, BigQuery (complex SQL,
    data warehousing) and Vertex AI (deployment, serving).
    Strong capability in building ETL/ELT pipelines
  - You are comfortable with Git, Docker, and Kubernetes. You
    are experienced in devops and know how to set up CI/CD
    pipelines to automate all the necessary testing and
    deployment. Practical knowledge of securing applications
    (API security, secrets management, IAM, input
    sanitization)
  - Familiarity with MCP and A2A protocols. Hands-on experience
    with some LLMOps and AI evaluation framework (e.g. GenAI
    Evals on Vertex, DSPy, RAGAs) as well as high quality
    vector databases (e.g. Weaviate, Milvus, Qdrant, or Neo4j)
  
  Nice to have
  
  - Experience in creative studios or digital production
  - Understanding of GDPR, data governance, and AI ethics
  - Experience working with fine tuning SLMs and specialized
    vertical AI agents, n8n, and video generation models
  - Experience with machine learning and neural networks
  
  What’s in it for you?
  
  - Flexible holiday policy for a proper recharge
  - Commuting allowance
  - Remote working possibilities in agreement with your team
  - A MacBook for peak productivity
  - Training opportunities to develop your skills and grow with
    us
  - Healthy communal lunches to keep you fueled
  - Fun events to connect, recharge, and bond as a team
  - Phone allowance of up to €25/month (depending on your role)
  - Unlimited mental health support via OpenUp
  - A pension plan where you contribute a percentage of your
    salary
  - Gift card and birthday wishes every year
  - Dutch classes for international team members
