    surfacing potential risks or improvements.
  - Integrate AI and automation techniques into engineering
    workflows where applicable, improving efficiency and
    insight generation.
  
  - Develop and maintain datasets and transformations that power
    analytics, dashboards, and data science use cases.
  
  Collaboration & Mentorship
  
  - Work cross-functionally with product, technology, and
    commercial teams to translate requirements into technical
    solutions.
  - Mentor early-career engineers by providing code feedback,
    technical guidance, and documentation support.
  - Contribute to improving team processes, standards, and
    tooling for long-term scalability.
  - Communicate effectively with both technical and non-
    technical stakeholders.
  - Identify opportunities to leverage automation and AI tools
    to streamline data operations and decision-making.
