  multiple teams.
  
  This role partners closely with G&A leaders to improve
  operational efficiency, reduce manual work, and enable
  better decision-making through thoughtful AI adoption. In

    where AI can reduce toil, improve accuracy, or accelerate
    outcomes
  - Design and implement AI-enabled solutions that align with
    functional needs and company standards
  - Lead AI solutions that span multiple teams or apply broadly
    across the company (e.g., internal assistants, automation,
    intelligence layers)
  - Help establish best practices and reusable patterns for
    internal AI development within Corporate Engineering
  - Build and configure AI-driven solutions using a mix of
    declarative (clicks-based) tools and custom development
    (code)
  - Integrate AI capabilities into existing internal systems
    while maintaining security, privacy, and data integrity
  - Evaluate and recommend AI tools and platforms based on
    business impact, technical fit, and risk considerations
  - Collaboration & Governance
  - Translate business problems into technical solutions through
    close partnership with internal stakeholders
  - Partner with Security, Legal, and IT to ensure AI solutions
    meet compliance, privacy, and governance requirements
  - Balance experimentation and iteration with operational rigor
    and long-term maintainability
  
  How to be successful in this role:
  
  - Experience: 5+ years of experience in systems engineering,
    business systems, internal platforms, or related roles
  - AI expertise: Strong understanding of AI technologies and
    their practical application in internal systems
  - Systems thinking: Proven ability to design scalable,
    maintainable solutions across multiple tools and teams
  - Build capability: Comfort working with both declarative
    configuration (clicks) and custom development (code)
  - Problem-solving: Strong analytical skills to identify
    inefficiencies and apply thoughtful AI-driven improvements
  - Ownership mindset: Ability to drive initiatives from concept
    through implementation with minimal oversight
  - Collaboration: Excellent communication skills and ability to
    partner effectively across G&A and company-wide
    stakeholders
  - Open to using AI to amplify their skills and strengthen
    their work - demonstrating curiosity, a willingness to
    learn, and sound judgment in applying AI responsibly to
    improve efficiency and impact.

  About Vanta
  
  We started in 2018, in the wake of several high-profile data
  breaches. Online security was only becoming more important,
  but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing
  companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build
  a solid security foundation. Vanta was inspired by a vision
  to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling
  companies to improve and prove their security. From our
  early days automating security monitoring for compliance
  standards like SOC 2, HIPAA and ISO 27001 to creating the
  world's leading Trust Management Platform, our vision
  remains unchanged.
  
  Now more than ever, making security continuous—not just a
  point-in-time check— is essential. Thousands of companies
  rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their
  trust— all in a way that's real-time and transparent.
