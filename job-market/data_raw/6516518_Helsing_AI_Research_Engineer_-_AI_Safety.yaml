  Who we are
  
  At Helsing we deliver AI-based capabilities and the enabling
  foundation that allow machines to perceive and assist human
  decision-making. You will have the unique opportunity to
  shape AI capabilities in one of the most challenging
  sectors, where high generalisation capabilities need to be
  paired with hardware constraints and robustness against
  adversarial attacks.
  
  You will join a team focused on AI Assurance, where you will
  develop cutting-edge techniques for scalable evaluation of
  AI products across the company, design data collection and
  experimentation strategies to extract causal insights, and
  enhance responsible decision-making via uncertainty
  quantification and safety mechanisms.
  
  The day-to-day
  
  You will be responsible for defining operational domains and
  evaluating the reliability of the AI capabilities developed
  in-house. You will develop and extend the state-of-the-art
  in uncertainty quantification and uncertainty calibration.
  This will involve understanding the AI systems we build,
  interfacing with them, and evaluating their robustness in
  real-world and adversarial scenarios. You will contribute to
  impactful projects and will collaborate with people across
  several teams and backgrounds.
  
  You should apply if you
  
  - Hold a STEM MSc with solid mathematical and statistical
    background.
  
  - Have excellent communication skills and the ability to
    report and present research findings clearly and
    efficiently both internally and externally
  - Are passionate about keeping up to date with current
    research and enjoy reimplementing / extending papers on
    state of the art Deep Learning-based approaches
  - Possess solid software engineering skills, writing clean and
    well-structured code in Python and/or languages like Rust,
    Java, or modern C++, and experience deploying AI software
    to production including testing, QA, and monitoring
  
  Note: We operate at an intersection where women, as well as
  other minority groups, are systemically under-represented.
  We encourage you to apply even if you don’t meet all the
  listed qualifications;  ability and impact cannot be
  summarised in a few bullet points.
  
  Nice to have
  
  - PhD in either model evaluation and robustness, uncertainty
    quantification, experimental design, causal inference or
    related fields.
  - Have authored publications in top-tier journals and
    conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, etc.).
  - Previous industrial experience in assuring the safe
    deployment of AI products.
  - Experience deploying AI software to production including
    testing, quality assurance, and monitoring
  
  Join Helsing and work with world-leading experts in their
  fields
  
  - Helsing’s work is important. You’ll be directly contributing
    to the protection of democratic countries while balancing
    both ethical and geopolitical concerns.
  - The work is unique. We operate in a domain that has highly
    unusual technical requirements and constraints, and where
    robustness, safety, and ethical considerations are vital.
    You will face unique Engineering and AI challenges that
    make a meaningful impact in the world.
  - Our work frequently takes us right up to the state of the
    art in technical innovation, be it reinforcement learning,
    distributed systems, generative AI, or deployment
    infrastructure. The defence industry is entering the most
    exciting phase of the technological development curve.
    Advances in our field of world are not incremental:
    Helsing is part of, and often leading, historic leaps
    forward.
  - In our domain, success is a matter of order-of-magnitude
    improvements and novel capabilities. This means we take
    bets, aim high, and focus on big opportunities. Despite
    being a relatively young company, Helsing has already been
    selected for multiple significant government contracts.
  - We actively encourage healthy, proactive, and diverse debate
    internally about what we do and how we choose to do it.
    Teams and individual engineers are trusted (and
    encouraged) to practise responsible autonomy and critical
    thinking, and to focus on outcomes, not conformity. At
    Helsing you will have a say in how we (and you!) work, the
    opportunity to engage on what does and doesn’t work, and
    to take ownership of aspects of our culture that you care
    deeply about.
  
  What we offer
  
  - A focus on outcomes, not time-tracking
  - Competitive compensation and stock options
  - Relocation support
  - Social and education allowances
  - Regular company events and all-hands to bring together
    employees as one team across Europe
  - A hands-on onboarding program (affectionately labelled “AI-
    duction”), in which you will be familiarising yourself
    with our tools and ML pipelines used across the company.
    This is your opportunity to learn our tech stack, explore
    the company, and learn how we get things done - all whilst
    working with other AI and engineering teams from day one
  
  Helsing is an equal opportunities employer. We are committed
  to equal employment opportunity regardless of race,
  religion, sexual orientation, age, marital status,
  disability or gender identity. Please do not submit personal
  data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
  religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership,
  data concerning your health, or data concerning your sexual
  orientation.
