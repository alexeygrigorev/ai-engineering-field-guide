  LogicMonitor is advancing observability through AI‑driven
  data intelligence, connecting massive telemetry streams with
  the reasoning capabilities of large language models. We’re
  looking for a Senior Software Engineer who sits at the
  intersection of backend systems and data engineering,
  capable of building scalable data pipelines, APIs, and
  retrieval frameworks that fuel Edwin AI, Dexda, and other
  AIOps products. You’ll design, build, and optimize the data
  infrastructure that makes GenAI‑powered insights reliable,
  explainable, and real‑time.
  
  Here's a closer look at this key role:
  
  - Design and build streaming and batch data pipelines that
    process metrics, logs, and events for AI workflows.
  - Develop ETL and feature‑extraction pipelines using Python
    and Java microservices.
  - Integrate data ingestion and enrichment from multiple
    observability sources into AI‑ready formats.
  - Build resilient data orchestration using Kafka, Airflow, and
    Redis Streams.
  - Develop data indexing and semantic search for large‑scale
    observability and operational data.
  - Work with structured and unstructured data lakes and
    warehouses (Delta Lake, Iceberg, ClickHouse).
  - Collaborate with the AI Platform team to manage embeddings,
    metadata, and model context storage.
  - Optimize latency and throughput for retrieval, query
    expansion, and AI response generation.
  - Build and maintain Java microservices (Spring Boot) that
    serve AI and analytics data to Edwin and AIOps
    applications.
  - Develop Python APIs (FastAPI / LangGraph) for LLM
    orchestration, summarization, and correlation reasoning.
  - Implement schema contracts and streaming protocols (REST,
    gRPC, SSE, WebSockets) between services.
  - Ensure fault‑tolerant, observable, and performant API
    infrastructure.
  - Instrument services with OpenTelemetry for unified metrics,
    tracing, and logging.
  - Implement data validation, schema evolution, and lineage
    tracking across AI pipelines.
  - Enforce data privacy, RBAC, and compliance for model inputs
    and stored context.
  - Collaborate with SRE and AI teams to monitor and optimize
    end‑to‑end AI system performance.
  
  What You'll Need:
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Engineering, or
    a related field.
  - 4-5 years of experience in backend or data systems
    engineering.
  - Experience building streaming data pipelines (Kafka / Spark
    or any similar technology).
  - Strong programming background in Java and Python, including
    microservice design.
  - Experience with ETL, data modeling, and distributed storage
    systems.
  - Familiarity with LLM pipelines, embeddings, and vector
    retrieval.
  - Understanding of Kubernetes, containerization, and CI/CD
    workflows.
  - Awareness of data governance, validation, and lineage best
