  Position Overview
  
  
  If you love building real systems that real customers
  use—and you get genuinely excited about LLMs, RAG, MCP, and
  agentic architectures—this role is for you.
  
  
  The Applied AI team in Autodesk’s Data and Process
  Management (DPM) organization ships Cloud-Native AI agents
  that make our Product Data Management (PDM) and Product
  Lifecycle Management (PLM) workflows smarter and easier.
  This is a hands-on architecture role where you’ll design
  core platform patterns and also write code that lands in
  production.
  
  
  We’re looking for a modern builder: Ambitious, Curious, and
  Practical—someone who has already shipped Scalable, Cloud-
  Native AI Applications to production and wants to level up
  further. You might have expertise in GenAI Applications, or
  you might have shipped traditional Machine Learning
  applications (recommendations, forecasting, anomaly
  detection) at scale and are ready to go all-in on agentic
  architectures. Either way, you build for reliability,
  quality, and impact.
  
  
  AI-assisted engineering (how we deliver): We use modern AI
  coding agents (e.g., Cursor Agent, Claude Code, Codex or
  similar) as accelerators for planning, implementation,
  debugging, and documentation—but you own correctness,
  security, and maintainability.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  
  • Build and ship production-grade cloud-native Agentic AI
  applications that are  resilient, performant, and can scale
  well in production
  
  • Fine-tune, evaluate, and deploy large language models in
  production environments
  
  • Implement evaluation + observability standards (regression
  tests, monitoring, feedback loops)
  
  • Integrate agents with internal/external services using
  MCP-based integrations or equivalent tool/context
  integration patterns
  
  • Partner with product managers, architects, developers, and
  data scientists to bring AI features to life in Autodesk
  products
  
  • AI-assisted delivery: Use AI coding agents to accelerate
  delivery of production features and fixes, with rigorous
  verification (tests, CI, code review) and security-aware
  usage
  
  Minimum Qualifications
  
  
  • Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Machine
  Learning, Data Science, or equivalent practical experience
  
  • 5+ years building cloud-native software in production
  (distributed systems, APIs, data-intensive services,
  reliability and operations)
  
  • 2+ years of hands-on experience of delivering AI/ML-
  powered system in production . This can include:
  
  • Traditional ML cloud applications (training pipelines,
  deployment, monitoring, iteration), and/or
  
  • LLM-based systems (RAG, MCP, Agent workflows, fine-tuned
  models)
  
  • Experience with MCP or similar standardized patterns for
  connecting models to tools and context
  
  • Experience with deploying and maintaining AI Applications
  in production reliably, monitoring performance, and
  improving over time
  
  • Proficiency in Python/TypeScript/Java with strong
  engineering fundamentals (testing, code quality,
  performance, security)
  
  • Excellent technical writing and communication skills for
  documentation, presentations, and influencing cross-
  functional teams
  
  •  Demonstrated experience using AI coding tools to ship
  production systems, and the engineering judgment to verify
  and correct AI output (code review rigor, debugging skill,
  ownership of correctness)
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  
  • Experience building AI applications in the CAD or
  manufacturing domain
  
  • Proven track record of building and deploying scalable
  cloud-native AI applications using platforms like AWS,
  Azure, or Google Cloud
  
  • Familiarity with deep learning architectures (e.g.,
  Transformers) and modern ML frameworks such as PyTorch,
  Lightning, and Ray
  
  • Hands-on experience with AWS and SageMaker for scalable
  training and deployment
  
  • Contributions to open-source AI projects or publications
  in the field
  
  • Experience with emerging Agentic AI solutions such as
  LangGraph, CrewAI, A2A, Opik Comet, or equivalents.
