  At JetBrains, code is our passion. Ever since we started
  back in 2000, we have strived to make the strongest, most
  effective developer tools on earth. By automating routine
  checks and corrections, our tools speed up production,
  freeing developers to grow, discover, and create.
  
  The IntelliJ AI team develops the AI-specific core of
  JetBrains IDEs. It provides an agentic experience and
  enhances features like code completion, next edit
  suggestions, and VCS operations. Our plugin is actively used
  across multiple JetBrains IDEs, continually improving the
  coding experience for thousands of developers, and we aim to
  provide the leading AI-powered coding assistant, not just a
  competitor but the clear market leader.
  
  We are now looking for Senior Software Developers to work on
  the core AI features.
  
  In this role, you'll get an opportunity to:
  
  - Integrate state-of-the-art AI agents into our IDEs,
    continuously improving the developer experience of working
    with them.
  - Enhance agent capabilities by equipping them with the most
    intelligent tools available in our IDEs.
  - Improve the coding experience in the editor by building and
    evolving ML-powered code completion and other AI features.
  - Create novel AI features with no direct market analogs,
    experimenting with and exploring the new possibilities
    brought by modern AI technologies.
  - Measure and evaluate the performance of agents and other AI
    features to achieve reliability and reproducibility in our
    new, non-deterministic world.
  
  We’re hiring for several roles within the team. Not all of
  the requirements below are applicable to every vacant
  position. Generally speaking, we’re looking for strong
  engineers who bring depth in one or more of these areas.
  
  All candidates should:
  
  - Want to help build the best IDEs in the world and push the
    boundaries of what developer tools can do.
  - Have strong knowledge of Java, Kotlin, or a similar
    programming language.
  - Be comfortable with system architecture and able to design,
    evolve, and improve complex systems.
  - Be self-driven, comfortable working independently, and able
    to take end-to-end ownership of projects.
  
  We are looking for candidates with experience in the
  following specific areas:
  
  IDE and platform development
  
  - Developing IDEs, code editors, or large, complex desktop
    applications.
  - Concurrent programming, with prior experience leveraging
    multithreading to improve performance and scalability.
  - Working on correctness-critical, detail-oriented systems.
  
  AI-powered features
  
  - Developing AI/ML-powered features.
  - Developing and improving LLM-based functionality, including
    context awareness, online evaluation, and offline
    experimentation.
  
  Evaluation and infrastructure
  
  - Building infrastructure to evaluate AI features.
  - Creating internal platforms, experimentation frameworks, or
    large-scale systems.
