  About This Opportunity
  
  We’re looking for exceptional AI engineers who’ve shipped
  breakthrough products that millions actually use. The kind
  of people who don’t just integrate APIs, they build features
  users love.
  
  You’ll work with Automattic’s ecosystem, spanning
  WordPress.com, WooCommerce, Tumblr, Beeper, Clay, and more.
  If you’re in NYC, you’ll collaborate in-person with our AI
  team. If you’re distributed, you’ll work the way Automattic
  has for 20 years: asynchronously, transparently, with a
  focus on impact over hours.
  
  This is about working on fascinating problems at scale with
  the backing of a profitable, mission-driven company. Whether
  you’re embedding with Other Bets teams, helping existing
  products leverage AI, or exploring new opportunities with
  our data and distribution, you’ll have the resources and
  reach to build things that matter to millions.Why This Role
  Matters
  
  Shape how AI transforms products used by hundreds of
  millions of people across the planet, from helping creators
  tell better stories to empowering merchants to compete
  effectively. You’ll tackle fascinating challenges across our
  entire ecosystem—with the backing of a profitable, mission-
  driven company.
  
  Whether you're working in-person in NYC or distributed
  globally, you’ll have the autonomy to focus on high-impact
  work without the typical constraints of startups
  (fundraising pressure, runway anxiety) or large tech
  companies (bureaucracy, slow decision-making).
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Ship user-facing AI features across Automattic’s product
    ecosystem; from site building tools to ecommerce
    recommendations to messaging experiences.
  - Build and iterate rapidly on AI-powered products that
    directly impact millions of users.
  - Collaborate with PMs, designers, and engineers (in-person in
    NYC or distributed globally) in a fast-paced environment
    optimized for innovation.
  - Experiment and scale successful AI innovations from
    prototype to production across multiple products.
  - Embed with teams to work on products such as WordPress.com,
    WooCommerce, Jetpack, Clay, Beeper, Pocket Casts, etc.
  - Stay current with AI developments that unlock new user
    experiences.
  
  You’ll Thrive Here If You
  
  - Have shipped AI features that users actually use. Production
    experience is valued over theoretical knowledge.
  - Are exceptionally talented. You’re the person other great
    engineers want to work with.
  - Are strong across the stack OR deeply expert in your domain.
    We value both breadth and depth.
  - Move fast without breaking things. Prototype quickly while
    building for scale.
  - Think product-first. You know great AI is invisible to
    users; it just makes their experience better.
  - Work well in distributed teams or love in-person
    collaboration if you’re NYC-based.
  - Are drawn to working with other exceptional people rather
    than just seeking comfortable work environments.
  
  Technical Experience We Value
  
  - Production experience with LLMs (APIs or custom
    implementations) at meaningful scale.
  - Strong full-stack development (we use PHP, Typescript, and
    React, primarily).
  - Building AI-powered user interfaces that perform well at
    scale.
  - Machine learning fundamentals and staying current with rapid
    field developments.
  - Track record of technical leadership or influence on high-
    performing teams.
  
  Bonus Points
  
  - Developed consumer AI products that scaled to a significant
    numbers of users.
  - Experience with WordPress, ecommerce,, or messaging
    platforms.
  - Open source contributions showing your thinking.
  - Previous startup experience as a founder or early engineer.
  - Based in NYC or willing to relocate (strong preference, but
    not required).
  
  Salary range: $70,000 to $170,000 USD. Please note that
  salary ranges are global, regardless of location, and we pay
  in local currency.
  
  We are searching for high-caliber candidates with the skills
  and qualities to have a net positive for Automattic. Pay
  will reflect the potential contribution and the impact you
  can bring, which may, in some cases, go beyond the range
  stated.
  
  We’re pleased to offer a straightforward, competitive base
  salary, providing financial clarity without complex variable
  components. This isn’t your typical work-from-home job: we
  are a fully-remote company with an open vacation policy. To
