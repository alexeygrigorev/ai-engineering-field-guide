  Job Description/Preferred Qualifications
  
  Position Overview
  
  We are seeking a hands-on AI/ML Engineer specializing in
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to design, build, and
  optimize production-grade systems that ground LLM responses
  in enterprise knowledge. You will own end-to-end retrieval
  pipelines—from ingestion and indexing to hybrid search,
  reranking, and evaluation—ensuring high relevance, low
  latency, and measurable reductions in hallucinations and
  answer failures.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - RAG Pipeline Design & Seeing It Through to Production
  
  - Design and implement robust RAG pipelines: ingestion,
    parsing, chunking, enrichment, embedding, indexing,
    retrieval, reranking, and answer generation.
  
  - Choose and tune retrieval strategies (dense, sparse/lexical,
    and hybrid) to maximize recall and precision for real
    enterprise queries.
  
  - Build citation/grounding mechanisms and response policies to
    ensure traceable, trustworthy outputs.
  
  - Indexing, Search Quality & Ranking
  
  - Implement and optimize vector and hybrid search over
    structured and unstructured data (documents, wikis,
    tickets, logs, and metadata).
  
  - Develop reranking strategies (cross-encoder, late-
    interaction, or LLM-based) and fusion methods
    (RRF/weighted fusion) to improve ranking quality.
  
  - Establish query understanding and rewriting techniques
    (intent classification, expansions, entity/keyword
    boosting) to improve retrieval robustness.
  
  - Evaluation, Guardrails & Continuous Improvement
  
  - Define an evaluation harness for retrieval and generation
    using offline datasets and online telemetry
    (precision/recall@k, MRR/nDCG, groundedness).
  
  - Implement automated regression tests and quality gates for
    new prompts, retrievers, and model updates.
  
  - Create feedback loops using human review and lightweight
    labeling to improve relevance over time.
  
  - Performance, Reliability & Cost Efficiency
  
  - Optimize latency and throughput using caching, batching,
    streaming responses, and efficient retrieval/index
    configurations.
  
  - Instrument the full pipeline with logs, metrics, traces,
    dashboards, and alerting; triage failures with runbooks.
  
  - Drive cost-aware design across embedding, retrieval, and
    generation (token budgets, context windows, adaptive
    retrieval).
  
  - Security, Access Control & Compliance
  
  - Implement document-level security and access control in
    retrieval (ACL-aware indexing, filtering, or query-time
    authorization checks).
  
  - Ensure safe handling of sensitive data, auditability, and
    compliance with enterprise governance standards.
  
  - Collaboration & Enablement
  
  - Partner with domain owners and engineering teams to
    prioritize use cases and integrate RAG into products and
    workflows.
  
  - Document best practices and provide reusable templates for
    ingestion, evaluation, and deployment.
  
  Required Qualifications
  
  - Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Data
    Science, Human-Computer Interaction, or a related field
    with 5+ years of relevant experience; OR a Master's/PhD
    with 3+ years of relevant experience.
  
  - Strong programming skills in Python and experience with
    LLM/RAG development in production environments.
  
  - Experience with vector databases or search engines and
    retrieval concepts (ANN indexes, BM25/lexical search,
    hybrid retrieval).
  
  - Experience designing evaluation methods for retrieval and
    LLM outputs (grounding, relevance, factuality, and
    regression testing).
  
  - Experience building scalable services and APIs (REST/gRPC),
    with attention to reliability and performance.
  
  - Strong understanding of data processing pipelines, metadata
    design, and information retrieval fundamentals.
  
  - Excellent communication skills and ability to work
    effectively in cross-functional teams.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Experience with ranking/reranking techniques (cross-
    encoders, late-interaction, learning-to-rank) and fusion
    methods (RRF, weighted scoring).
  
  - Experience with document parsing for PDFs/HTML and handling
    tables, diagrams, or mixed layouts.
  
  - Experience with observability and SRE practices for AI
    systems (SLOs/SLIs, incident response, runbooks).
  
  - Experience implementing ACL-aware retrieval and security
    patterns for enterprise knowledge systems.
  
  - Experience building prompt/tooling libraries and maintaining
    multi-model compatibility across LLM providers.
  
  What Success Looks Like (First 6-12 Months)
  
  - A standardized RAG pipeline that measurably improves answer
    relevance while reducing hallucinations and unresolved
    queries.
  
  - A repeatable evaluation framework with quality gates that
    prevents regressions during model/retriever/prompt
    updates.
  
  - Meaningful latency and cost reductions via caching, adaptive
    retrieval, and efficient indexing/reranking strategies.
  
  - Secure, compliant retrieval that enforces access control
    without sacrificing search quality.
  
  
  
  Note: Technology choices may vary by team needs; candidates
  should be comfortable learning and adapting to new tools.
  
  Minimum Qualifications
  
  Doctorate (Academic) or work experience of 0 years ,
  Master's Level Degree or work experience of 2 years ,
  Bachelor's Level Degree or work experience of 3 years
