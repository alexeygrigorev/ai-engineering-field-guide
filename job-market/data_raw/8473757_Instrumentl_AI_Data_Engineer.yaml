  👋Hello, we’re Instrumentl. We’re a mission-driven startup
  helping the nonprofit sector to drive impact, and we’re well
  on our way to becoming the #1 most-loved grant discovery and
  management tool.
  
  About us: Instrumentl is a hypergrowth YC-backed startup
  with over 5,000 nonprofit clients, from local homeless
  shelters to larger organizations like the San Diego Zoo and
  the University of Alaska. We are building the future of
  fundraising automation, helping nonprofits to discover,
  track, and manage grants efficiently through our SaaS
  platform.
  
  Our charts are dramatically up-and-to-the-right 📈 — we’re
  cash flow positive and doubling year-over-year, with
  customers who love us (NPS is 65+ and Ellis PMF survey is
  60+). Join us on this rocket ship to Mars!
  
  About the Role
  
  As an AI Data Engineer at Instrumentl, you'll own the
  systems that discover, acquire, and transform unstructured
  content into clean, structured, queryable data. You'll build
  automated content discovery from the web, design LLM-powered
  extraction pipelines that convert grant documents,
  foundation profiles, and third-party data into canonical
  business objects—enabling our product teams to build
  intelligent features on a reliable data foundation. This is
  a data platform role: you'll own the extraction quality that
  populates our canonical data models and the pipeline
  reliability that keeps them current. You'll build evaluation
  harnesses, optimize for cost at scale, and ensure our AI-
  derived data is accurate enough to trust. You'll be part of
  the AI Engineering team, partnering closely with product
  engineers who consume your data products.
  
  What you’ll do
  
  - Build content discovery pipelines: Automate discovery and
    acquisition of grant-related content from the
    web—foundation websites, RFPs, program
    announcements—turning the open web into structured,
    actionable data.
  - Build LLM extraction pipelines: Implement production
    pipelines to transform unstructured text into canonical
    business objects—including document ingestion (PDFs, HTML,
    Word), OCR, table extraction, and layout-aware parsing.
    Partner with product engineers to evolve schemas as domain
    needs change.
  - Own semantic chunking and embeddings: Design chunking
    strategies optimized for retrieval; select and manage
    embedding models; maintain vector indices that power
    downstream search and RAG features.
  - Optimize for cost and latency: Profile token usage,
    implement caching and batching strategies, choose
    appropriate models for different tasks, and manage the
    cost/quality tradeoff at scale.
  - Maintain data quality and serve downstream consumers:
    Implement validation, anomaly detection, and alerting for
    extraction drift. Expose clean data via APIs, materialized
    views, or event streams that product teams can rely on
    without understanding the extraction complexity. Integrate
    and normalize data from external providers—resolving
    entities, mapping to internal schemas, and ensuring "Ford
    Foundation" and "The Ford Foundation" resolve to the same
    canonical record.
  
  What we're looking for
  
  - Software engineering background: 5+ years of professional
    software engineering experience, including 2+ years
    working with modern LLMs (as an IC). Startup experience
    and comfort operating in fast, scrappy environments is a
    plus.
  - Proven production impact: You’ve taken LLM/RAG systems from
    prototype to production, owned reliability/observability,
    and iterated post‑launch based on evals and user feedback.
  - LLM agentic systems: Experience building
    tool/function‑calling workflows, planning/execution loops,
    and safe tool integrations (e.g., with
    LangChain/LangGraph, LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel, or
    custom orchestration).
  - RAG expertise: Strong grasp of document ingestion,
    chunking/windowing, embeddings, hybrid search (keyword +
    vector), re‑ranking, and grounded citations.Experience
    with re‑rankers/cross‑encoders, hybrid retrieval tuning,
    or search/recommendation systems.
  - Embeddings & vector stores: Hands‑on with embedding model
    selection/versioning and vector DBs (e.g., pgvector,
    FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, Qdrant). Document
    processing at scale (PDF parsing/OCR), structured
    extraction with JSON schemas, and schema‑guided
    generation.
  - Evaluation mindset: Comfort designing eval suites (RAG/QA,
    extraction, summarization), using automated and
    human‑in‑the‑loop methods; familiarity with frameworks
    like Ragas/DeepEval/OpenAI Evals or equivalent.
  - Infrastructure & languages: Proficiency in Python (FastAPI,
    Celery) and TypeScript/Node; familiarity with Ruby on
    Rails (our core platform) or willingness to learn.
  - Experience with AWS/GCP, Docker, CI/CD, and observability
    (logs/metrics/traces).
  - Data chops: Comfortable with SQL, schema design, and
    building/maintaining data pipelines that power retrieval
    and evaluation
  - Collaborative approach: You thrive in a cross‑functional
    environment and can translate researchy ideas into
    shippable, user‑friendly features.
  - Results‑driven: Bias for action and ownership with an eye
    for speed, quality, and simplicity.
  - Fine‑tuning: Practical experience with SFT/LoRA or
    instruction‑tuning (and good intuition for when
    fine‑tuning vs. prompting vs. model choice is the right
    lever).Exposure to open‑source LLMs (e.g., Llama) and
    providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google,
    Mistral).Familiarity with responsible AI, red‑teaming, and
    domain‑specific safety policies.
  
  Compensation & Benefits
  
  - For US-based candidates, our target salary band is $175,000
    - $220,000 USD + equity. Salary decisions consider
    experience, location, and technical depth
  - 100% covered health, dental, and vision insurance for
    employees (50% for dependents)
  - Generous PTO, including parental leave
  - 401(k)
  - Company laptop and home-office stipend
