  About the team
  
  Adaptive ML is a frontier AI startup building a
  Reinforcement Learning Operations (RLOps) platform that
  enables enterprises to specialize and deploy LLMs into
  production with measurable impact.
  
  We provide the core infrastructure to tune, evaluate, and
  serve specialized models at scale — pioneering task-specific
  LLM development and running production-ready workflows that
  serve millions of requests while optimizing for both cost
  and performance across distributed systems.
  
  Our tightly-knit team was previously involved in the
  creation of state-of-the-art open-access large language
  models. We raised a $20M seed led by Index Ventures and
  ICONIQ in early 2024, and we're already live in production
  with customers including Manulife, AT&T, Deloitte, across
  travel and financial services — with much more to be
  announced soon.
  
  At Adaptive ML, our Success team is part of our Technical
  Staff. Our Technical Staff develops the foundational
  technology that powers Adaptive ML, while the Success Team
  ensures our enterprise customers effectively leverage these
  technologies—particularly through our Adaptive Engine
  product—to unlock maximum value.
  
  About the role
  
  As a Forward Deployed AI Engineer at Adaptive ML, you will
  help our customers build scalable production applications
  with Adaptive Engine. Our customers range from innovative
  scale-ups to global enterprises, and your role will be to
  guide them in maximizing business value while shortening
  time to production. We place tremendous importance on
  bridging the gap from proof-of-concept to production, as too
  many generative AI projects fail to demonstrate tangible
  ROI.
  
  By leveraging state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
  technology, you will support the specialization of large
  language models for production deployment. You will build
  synthetic data pipelines to bootstrap models into production
  and identify signals that can be used in production to
  enable continuous model improvement using production
  feedback. We are looking for self-driven, business-minded,
  and ambitious individuals interested in supporting real-
  world deployments of a highly technical product. As this is
  an early role, you will have the opportunity to shape our
  research efforts and product as we grow.
  
  This is an in-person role based at our Toronto or New York
  office.
  
  Your responsibilities
  
  - Embed directly with our customers, helping them maximize the
    value of their Adaptive Engine deployment;
  - Experiment with pipelines to personalize models at scale,
    leveraging synthetic data and production feedback;
  - Ensure customer success, owning problems end-to-end from
    ideation to deployment, validation, and production;
  - Work closely with our research staff, productionizing the
    latest frontier research initiatives;
  - Contribute to our product roadmap, identifying promising
    trends and customer needs;
  - Report clearly on your work to a distributed collaborative
    team, with a bias for asynchronous written communication.
  
  Your (ideal) background
  
  The background below is only suggestive of a few pointers we
  believe could be relevant. We welcome applications from
  candidates with diverse backgrounds; do not hesitate to get
  in touch if you think you could be a great fit, even if the
  below doesn't fully describe you.
  
  - ‍A M.Sc./Ph.D. in computer science, or demonstrated
    experience in software engineering, preferably with a
    focus on machine learning;
  - 4-8+ years of technical consulting (or equivalent)
    experience;‍
  - Strong programming skills, with Python experience required,
    from quick prototyping to production deployments;
  - Enthusiasm for collaborating with diverse technical teams,
    with a humble attitude and empathy;‍
  - Passionate about the future of generative AI, and eager to
    build foundational technology to help machines deliver
    more singular experiences.
  
  Benefits
  
  - Comprehensive medical (health, dental, and vision)
    insurance;
  - 401(k) plan with 4% matching (or equivalent);
  - Unlimited PTO — we strongly encourage at least 5 weeks each
    year;
  - Mental health, wellness, and personal development stipends;
  - Visa sponsorship if you wish to relocate to New York or
    Paris.
