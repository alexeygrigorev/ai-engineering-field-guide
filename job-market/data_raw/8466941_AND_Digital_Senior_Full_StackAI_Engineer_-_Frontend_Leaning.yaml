  Senior Full‑Stack/AI Engineer (Frontend-leaning)
  
  Who We Are:
  
  AND Digital are a tech company focused on accelerating
  digital delivery and dedicated to closing the digital skills
  gap. We’ve been helping organisations build better digital
  products and stronger digital teams since 2014.
  
  We believe our work should always leave a legacy for the
  client. We do this through close relationships with our
  offices (or ‘Clubs’) so that our partners are always
  prioritized by a regional team close to them.
  
  This unique model has driven success for our clients and
  ourselves, evidenced by our remarkable organic growth since
  2014. Today we number more than 1,300 people with Clubs all
  over the UK and Europe with plans for global expansion in
  the next couple of years.
  
  Join us - and help us fulfil our mission to close the
  world’s digital skills gap.
  
  What you’ll bring to the tableCore Technical Expertise
  
  - Deep hands‑on experience delivering full‑stack
    JavaScript/TypeScript solutions, with strong proficiency
    in React, Next.js, Node.js, and the broader JavaScript
    ecosystem.
  - Proven ability to build high‑quality, production‑ready
    systems, with strong fundamentals in performance,
    accessibility, security, and maintainability.
  - Demonstrates technical leadership within a squad, shaping
    implementation approaches, influencing architectural
    decisions, and role‑modelling engineering excellence
    through hands‑on contribution.
  - Strong understanding of cloud infrastructure (AWS
    preferable) and CI/CD pipelines, including how
    applications are built, deployed, monitored, and operated
    in production.
  - Brings a DevOps mindset, ensuring smooth delivery workflows,
    observability, and operational readiness.
  - Able to take ownership of complex technical problems, make
    pragmatic trade‑offs, and clearly articulate decisions to
    both technical and non‑technical stakeholders.
  - Comfortable working across the stack, even if
    frontend‑leaning, with the ability to contribute
    meaningfully to backend services when needed.
  
  AI & Emerging Technology
  
  - Practical experience applying AI in real delivery
    contexts—e.g., integrating AI APIs/services, building
    AI‑augmented user experiences, or using AI‑assisted
    development tools responsibly.
  - Understands where AI provides genuine value versus where
    traditional engineering approaches are more appropriate.
  - Able to evaluate risk, cost, maintainability, and user
    impact when proposing AI‑driven solutions.
  - Curious about emerging AI patterns, frameworks, and tooling,
    with the ability to apply them pragmatically rather than
    experimentally.
  - Comfortable guiding clients on realistic AI opportunities,
    helping them navigate hype vs. practical value.
  
  Consulting & Client Delivery
  
  - Experience working in consulting or client‑facing
    environments, operating confidently in ambiguous problem
    spaces.
  - Able to engage with stakeholders to shape requirements,
    clarify constraints, and contribute to solution
    discovery—not just implementation.
  - Strong communication skills, capable of translating
    technical concepts into clear, outcome‑focused language
    for clients and business stakeholders.
  - Brings a collaborative, delivery‑focused mindset, balancing
    technical quality with client priorities and timelines.
  
  Nice To Have (but valuable)
  
  - Experience with design systems, component libraries, or
    frontend architecture at scale.
  
  Exposure to serverless, edge runtimes, or modern deployment
  patterns (e.g., Vercel, CloudFront, Lambda@Edge).
