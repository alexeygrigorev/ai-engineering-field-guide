description: |
  Veeam, the #1 global market leader in data resilience,
  believes businesses should control all their data whenever
  and wherever they need it. Veeam provides data resilience
  through data backup, data recovery, data portability, data
  security, and data intelligence. Based in Seattle, Veeam
  protects over 550,000 customers worldwide who trust Veeam to
  keep their businesses running. Join us as we move forward
  together, growing, learning, and making a real impact for
  some of the world’s biggest brands. The future of data
  resilience is here - go fearlessly forward with us.
  
  As an AI Engineer on the Veeam Data Cloud Intelligence team,
  you'll design and manage innovative systems that enable
  Veeam's customers to extract meaningful insights from their
  enterprise data, securely stored within the VDC.
  
  We’re building production systems that help to discover and
  understand data so as to make organizations more resilient.
  You’ll be asked to investigate best practices, rapidly
  iterate on prototypes, and then productize your work so as
  to have a clear impact across multiple Veeam services.
  
  Why this role is unique:
  
  - Greenfield Opportunity: Many of our workflows, including
    secure semantic discovery at scale, are industry firsts.
    You’ll help invent and define them.
  - The Data is Real—and Huge: You'll work with exabyte-scale
    backup data from some of the world’s largest enterprises.
    It’s heterogeneous, richly structured, multilingual, and
    full of opportunities for insight.
  - Production AI, Not Just Models: You’ll be building end-to-
    end, customer-facing capabilities—not just research
    prototypes. These systems will be measured in uptime,
    relevance, and ROI.
  
  Your tasks will include:
  
  - Build and operate AI-powered services that summarize
    document content, extract keywords, and generate vector
    embeddings from backed-up data using cutting-edge services
  - Design secure interfaces for AI agents to query backup data
    via Model Context Protocol (MCP), enforcing tenant-aware
    RBAC and query constraints
  - Own and optimize prompt engineering and evaluation workflows
    for our LLM-based assistant, Veeam Intelligence
  - Help define and improve our AI quality benchmarks—whether
    for retrieval relevance, summarization accuracy, or agent
    response reliability
  - Collaborate across the stack and across the VDC engineering
    organization to ensure AI workflows are deeply integrated
    and consistently performant
  - Tune AI workflows for performance, cost, latency, and
    observability—especially important when working with
    billions of documents across global regions
  
  What we expect from you:
  
  - Strong backend engineering skills in Python and modern AI
    tooling (e.g., OpenAI APIs, LangChain, transformers, Azure
    ML)
  - Experience working with embeddings, LLMs, or AI-based
    summarization/extraction pipelines in production
    environments
  - Experience with prompt engineering and prompt tuning,
    including strategies to improve output quality, reduce
    hallucinations, and support structured responses
  - Awareness of jailbreaking techniques and adversarial
    prompts; ability to think like an attacker to proactively
    harden LLM-powered workflows
  - Exposure to agent architectures (e.g., Model Context
    Protocol, Agent to Agent)
  - Security-first mindset—comfortable building systems with
    RBAC, data boundary enforcement, and operational
    safeguards against misuse
  - Proactive in staying current with industry trends in LLMs,
    search, and AI infrastructure, and able to synthesize and
    share relevant developments with the team
  - Practical knowledge of cloud-based infrastructure,
    preferably in Azure (Event Bus Services, Blob Storage,
    Kubernetes, CosmosDB, Azure Open AI Service)
  - Strong written and verbal communication (English). Ability
    to collaborate with team members, flesh out solutions to
    ambiguous problems, and drive consensus
  
  Will be an advantage:
  
  - Familiarity with prompt evaluation frameworks or LLM
    observability tooling.
  - Experience working with RBAC-enforced, multi-tenant systems.
