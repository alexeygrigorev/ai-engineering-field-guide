  Job Description:
  
  We’re building AI-first products from the ground up, not
  bolting AI onto existing workflows. Our goal is to replace
  slow, manual processes with intelligent systems that think,
  adapt, and improve over time. You’ll be helping define how
  AI is used in our product, not just implementing tickets.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  ● Build, ship, and iterate on AI-powered features end to end
  
  ● Design and deploy machine learning models that solve real
  problems
  
  ● Work closely with product and engineering to turn ideas
  into working software
  
  ● Integrate models into production systems (APIs, services,
  workflows)
  
  ● Experiment with new tools, models, and approaches and keep
  what works
  
  ● Improve performance, reliability, and scalability as we
  grow
  
  Requirements:
  
  ● Strong software engineering fundamentals and experience
  building real products
  
  ● Solid Python skills
  
  ● Hands-on experience with ML frameworks like PyTorch,
  TensorFlow, or similar
  
  ● Comfort working in cloud environments
  
  ● Ability to move fast, make tradeoffs, and own your work
  
  ● Clear communicator who plays well with others
  
  Job Type: Full-time, Remote
  
  Pay: $80,000 - $100,000
  
  Benefits:
