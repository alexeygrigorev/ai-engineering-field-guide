  About the Role
  
  Together AI is building the AI Acceleration Cloud, an end-
  to-end platform for the full generative AI lifecycle,
  combining the fastest LLM inference engine with state-of-
  the-art AI cloud infrastructure.
  
  As a Senior AI Infrastructure Engineer, you will play a key
  role in building the next generation AI cloud platform – a
  highly available, global, blazing-fast cloud infrastructure
  that virtualizes cutting-edge ML hardware (GB200s/GB300s,
  BlueField DPUs) and enables state-of-the-art ML
  practitioners with self-serve AI cloud services, such as on-
  demand + managed Kubernetes and Slurm clusters. This
  platform serves both our internal SaaS products (inference,
  fine-tuning) and our external cloud customers, spanning
  dozens of data centers across the world.
  
  Hybrid working two days a week in the Amsterdam office.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Design, build, and maintain performant, secure, and highly-
    available backend services/operators that run in our data
    centers and automate hardware management, such as
    Infiniband partitioning, in-DC parallel storage
    provisioning, and VM provisioning.
  - Design and build out the IaaS software layer for a new GB200
    data center with thousands of GPUs.
  - Work on a global multi-exabyte high-performance object
    store, serving massive datasets for pretraining.
  - Build advanced observability stacks for our customers with
    automated node lifecycle management for fault-tolerant
    distributed pretraining.
  - Perform architecture and research work for decentralized AI
    workloads
  - Work on the core, open-source Together AI platform
  - Create services, tools, and developer documentation
  - Create testing frameworks for robustness and fault-tolerance
  
  To be successful, you’ll need to be deeply technical and
  possess excellent communication, collaboration, and
  diplomacy skills. You have strong fundamental software
  development skills. In addition, you have strong systems
  knowledge and troubleshooting abilities.
  
  Requirements
  
  - 5+ years of professional software development experience and
    proficiency in at least one backend programming language
    (Golang desired)
  - 5+ years experience writing high-performance, well-tested,
    production quality code
  - Demonstrated experience with building and operating high-
    performance and/or globally distributed micro-service
    architectures across one or more cloud providers (AWS,
    Azure, GCP)
  - Excellent communication skills – able to write clear design
    docs and work effectively with both technical and non-
    technical team members
  - Deep experience with Kubernetes internals a big plus, such
    as implementing non-trivial Kubernetes operators,
    device/storage/network plugins, custom schedulers, or
    patches thereon or Kubernetes itself
  - Deep experience with VMs/hypervisors a big plus, such as
    QEMU/KVM, cloud-hypervisor, VFIO, virtio, PCIE
    passthrough, Kubevirt, SR-IOV
  - Deep experience with DC networking tech + solutions a big
    plus, such as VLAN, VXLAN, VPN, VPC, OVS/OVN
  - Experience with Cluster API or similar a big plus
  - Experience working on high-performance compute, networking,
    and/or storage a big plus
  - Experience virtualizing GPUs and/or Infiniband a big plus
  - Strong systems knowledge across compute, networking, and
    storage, including concurrency, memory management,
    performant I/O, and scale
  - Experience with infrastructure automation tools (Terraform,
    Ansible), monitoring/observability stacks (Prometheus,
    Grafana), and CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD)
  - Experience building IaaS or PaaS systems at scale a plus
  - Experience with DPUs/SmartNICs a plus
  - GPU programming, NCCL, CUDA knowledge a plus
