  Who we are
  
  Helsing is a defence AI company. Our mission is to protect
  our democracies. We aim to achieve technological leadership,
  so that open societies can continue to make sovereign
  decisions and control their ethical standards.
  
  As democracies, we believe we have a special responsibility
  to be thoughtful about the development and deployment of
  powerful technologies like AI. We take this responsibility
  seriously.
  
  We are an ambitious and committed team of engineers, AI
  specialists and customer-facing programme managers. We are
  looking for mission-driven people to join our European teams
  – and apply their skills to solve the most complex and
  impactful problems. We embrace an open and transparent
  culture that welcomes healthy debates on the use of
  technology in defence, its benefits, and its ethical
  implications.
  
  The role
  
  At Helsing we deliver AI-based capabilities and the enabling
  infrastructure that allow semi-autonomous platforms to
  localise, navigate, and perceive the world in real time. You
  will have the unique opportunity to shape the future of AI
  in one of the most challenging sectors, where performance
  needs to be paired up with high generalisation capabilities
  and strong robustness against adversarial attacks.
  
  You’ll build the autonomy brain for a cutting-edge
  autonomous aerial platform that will actually take flight.
  you'll be developing state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
  agents into the operational systems of our own Unmanned
  Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV), the CA-1 Europa, part of the
  groundbreaking Centaur project. This is a unique opportunity
  to directly contribute to a novel autonomous system designed
  from the ground up.
  
  The day-to-day
  
  You'll build, train and integrate reinforcement learning
  agents into high-performance runtime systems, enabling real-
  time autonomous decision-making in flight.
  
  You will contribute to our reinforcement learning stack by
  implementing, improving and extending the current state of
  the art in multi-agent reinforcement learning.
  
  You will be a part of impactful projects and will
  collaborate with people across several teams and backgrounds
  to integrate cutting edge ML/AI in our production systems.
  
  You should apply if you
  
  - Hold MSc in machine learning with a speciality in either
    reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, automation
    and control, or robotics.
  
  - Have excellent communication skills and the ability to
    report and present research findings clearly and
    efficiently both internally and externally.
  - Are passionate about keeping up-to-date with current
    research and enjoy reimplementing / extending papers on
    state-of-the-art Deep Learning-based approaches.
  - Possess solid software engineering skills, writing clean and
    well-structured code in Python and/or languages like Rust,
    Java, or modern C++, and experience deploying AI software
    to production including testing, QA, and monitoring.
  
  Note: We operate at an intersection where women, as well as
  other minority groups, are systematically under-represented.
  We encourage you to apply even if you don’t meet all the
  listed qualifications; ability and impact cannot be
  summarised in a few bullet points.
  
  Nice to have
  
  - PhD in reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems,
    automation and control, robotics, or related fields and
    have authored publications in top-tier journals and
    conferences (eg, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAMAS).
  - Experience with large-scale RL training.
  - Experience modeling and training multi-agent controllers
    using state-of-the-art tools and techniques.
  - Experience deploying AI software to production including
    testing, quality assurance, and monitoring
  
  Join Helsing and work with world-leading experts in their
  fields
  
  - Helsing’s work is important. You’ll be directly contributing
    to the protection of democratic countries while balancing
    both ethical and geopolitical concerns.
  - The work is unique. We operate in a domain that has highly
    unusual technical requirements and constraints, and where
    robustness, safety, and ethical considerations are vital.
    You will face unique Engineering and AI challenges that
    make a meaningful impact in the world.
  - Our work frequently takes us right up to the state of the
    art in technical innovation, be it reinforcement learning,
    distributed systems, generative AI, or deployment
    infrastructure. The defence industry is entering the most
    exciting phase of the technological development curve.
    Advances in our field of world are not incremental:
    Helsing is part of, and often leading, historic leaps
    forward.
  - In our domain, success is a matter of order-of-magnitude
    improvements and novel capabilities. This means we take
    bets, aim high, and focus on big opportunities. Despite
    being a relatively young company, Helsing has already been
    selected for multiple significant government contracts.
  - We actively encourage healthy, proactive, and diverse debate
    internally about what we do and how we choose to do it.
    Teams and individual engineers are trusted (and
    encouraged) to practise responsible autonomy and critical
    thinking, and to focus on outcomes, not conformity. At
    Helsing you will have a say in how we (and you!) work, the
    opportunity to engage on what does and doesn’t work, and
    to take ownership of aspects of our culture that you care
    deeply about.
  
  What we offer
  
  - A focus on outcomes, not time-tracking
  - Competitive compensation and stock options
  - Relocation support
  - Social and education allowances
  - Regular company events and all-hands to bring together
    employees as one team across Europe
  - A hands-on onboarding program (affectionately labelled “AI-
    duction”), in which you will be familiarising yourself
    with our tools and ML pipelines used across the company.
    This is your opportunity to learn our tech stack, explore
    the company, and learn how we get things done - all whilst
    working with other AI and engineering teams from day one
  
  Helsing is an equal opportunities employer. We are committed
  to equal employment opportunity regardless of race,
  religion, sexual orientation, age, marital status,
  disability or gender identity. Please do not submit personal
  data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,
  religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership,
