description: |
  At Arctic Wolf, we're redefining the cybersecurity
  landscape. With our employee Pack members, spread out
  globally, committed to setting new industry standards. Our
  accomplishments speak for themselves, from our recognition
  in the Forbes Cloud 100, CNBC Disruptor 50, Fortune Future
  50, and Fortune Cyber 60 to winning the 2024 CRN Products of
  the Year award. We’re proud to be named a Leader in the IDC
  MarketScape for Worldwide Managed Detection and Response
  Services and earning a Customers' Choice distinction from
  Gartner Peer Insights. Our Aurora Platform also received
  CRN’s Products of the Year award in the inaugural Security
  Operations Platform category. Join a company that’s not only
  leading, but also shaping, the future of security
  operations.
  
  Our mission is to end cyber risk. This is a unique
  opportunity to lead a high-impact, highly technical team in
  a fast-growing company recognized on the Deloitte Fast 500,
  with a track record of doubling in size, revenue, and
  customer base year over year.
  
  About the Role
  
  We are looking for a Senior Quality Engineer to ensure the
  reliability, safety, and performance of the next generation
  of agentic AI frameworks powering Arctic Wolf’s AI Proactive
  Defence platform.
  
  In this role, you’ll design and implement comprehensive
  quality strategies — combining manual and automated testing
  — to validate intelligent agents that reason, act, and
  collaborate autonomously. You’ll work closely with
  developers, data scientists, and product teams to verify AI-
  driven orchestration, multi-agent workflows, and LLM
  integrations in production-grade environments.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Design and implement end-to-end quality strategies for
    agentic AI systems, balancing manual exploratory testing
    with automation frameworks.
  - Develop and maintain validation frameworks for multi-agent
    orchestration logic — ensuring correctness in planning,
    decision-making, and adaptive behaviours.
  - Develop and run manual and automated test pipelines to
    validate end-to-end functionality, data flow, and system
    reliability across AI services.
  - Perform exploratory testing of AI reasoning, tool usage, and
    agent collaboration workflows to uncover edge cases and
    emergent behaviours.
  - Automate test coverage for APIs, microservices, and
    orchestration components using modern testing tools and
    frameworks.
  - Create observability and monitoring solutions to assess
    agent accuracy, latency, and behavioural consistency.
  - Collaborate with AI and backend developers to embed quality
    gates and automated checks into CI/CD pipelines.
  - Evaluate and integrate testing tools for AI-specific
    workflows (prompt validation, response benchmarking,
    output scoring).
  - Champion best practices for reproducibility, versioning, and
    manual/automated validation of AI model behaviours.
  - Contribute to cross-team initiatives — R&D demos,
    hackathons, and innovation sprints.
  
  About You
  
  - 5+ years of experience in Quality Engineering, SDET, or
    Software Testing (manual and automated) in distributed or
    AI-driven systems.
  - Strong experience designing and executing both manual
    exploratory tests and automated test frameworks.
  - Proficient in Python, Java, or Go for developing test
    automation scripts and frameworks.
  - Have worked on distributed systems and microservices
    architecture (preferred)
  - Hands-on experience with API testing, microservices
    validation, and CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions,
    Jenkins, etc.).
  - Experience with AI technologies and frameworks that enable
    intelligent agents, automation, and contextual reasoning.
  - Familiarity with cloud-native testing (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
    and containerized environments (Docker, Kubernetes).
  - Experience with observability tools (Grafana, Prometheus) to
    validate performance and system health.
  - Strong analytical, debugging, and communication skills; able
    to translate complex AI behaviours into clear, testable
    criteria.
  - Passionate about ensuring quality and trustworthiness in
    intelligent, autonomous systems.
  
  You have a history of delivering successful projects, as
  well as some lessons learned from failures. Even if you
  haven’t worked with all our specific technologies, you bring
  a diverse knowledge base that you use to help the team solve
  complex technical problems. You’ll receive all the security
  training you need during our onboarding process and through
  additional training on the job.
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Exposure to cybersecurity, SOC operations, or threat
    detection systems.
  - Experience validating machine learning models, data
    pipelines, or AI evaluation metrics.
  - Knowledge of ML Ops tools (MLflow, Kubeflow) and AI-specific
    test harnesses.
  - Contributions to open-source testing, QA, or AI projects.
