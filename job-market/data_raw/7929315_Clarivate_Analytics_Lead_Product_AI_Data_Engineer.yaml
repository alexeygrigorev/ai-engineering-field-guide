  We are seeking a Senior Lead Product AI Data Engineer to
  design, build, and optimize end-to-end data architecture and
  scalable data platforms that power product analytics and AI-
  driven capabilities. This role is intended for highly
  experienced data engineers with 5 years of experience and
  deep expertise in data architecture, dimensional data
  modeling, analytics architecture, and AI-ready data
  pipelines.
  
  In this role, you will operate as a senior individual
  contributor and technical lead, owning product-level data
  architecture decisions, complex data models, and pipelines
  while influencing technical direction through hands-on
  leadership and mentorship. You will collaborate closely with
  Product Managers, Data Scientists, Analysts, and Platform
  Engineers to ensure product and AI data is accurate, well-
  architected, scalable, and analytics-ready.
  
  We are building the next generation of AI-powered analytics,
  insights, and decision-support platforms for the global Life
  Sciences and Healthcare (LSH) community—supporting mission-
  critical use cases such as drug discovery acceleration,
  treatment effectiveness analysis, real-world evidence
  generation, and patient journey insights.
  
  This role blends data architecture ownership, deep technical
  execution, dimensional modeling excellence, and team-level
  technical leadership
  
  About You – experience, education, skills, and
  accomplishments
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in engineering or master’s degree (BE, ME,
    B Tech, MTech, MCA, MS)
  - Minimum 5 years of professional experience in data
    engineering, analytics engineering, or data
    architecture–heavy roles.
  - Expert-level proficiency in SQL and relational database
    design.
  - Strong programming experience in Python for data pipelines
    and automation.
  - Deep hands-on experience with data architecture and
    dimensional data modeling, including star schemas,
    snowflake schemas, fact tables, and dimension tables.
  - Strong understanding of slowly changing dimensions (SCDs),
    surrogate keys, grain definition, and hierarchical
    dimensions.
  - Experience designing and operating ETL/ELT pipelines for
    production analytics and AI/ML workloads.
  - Ability to influence technical outcomes through
    architectural leadership and collaboration.
  
  It would be great if you also have:
  
  - Experience with cloud data warehouses such as Snowflake,
    Data Bricks, BigQuery, or Amazon Redshift.
  - Familiarity with tools such as dbt, Airflow, Fivetran, and
    Segment.
  - Experience working with event-driven or semi-structured data
    (JSON, logs, clickstream).
  - Exposure to BI and visualization tools (Power BI, Tableau,
    SAP BusinessObjects).
  - Familiarity with AWS, Azure, or GCP, including data
    governance and security best practices.
