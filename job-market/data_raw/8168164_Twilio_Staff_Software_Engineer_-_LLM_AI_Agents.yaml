  See yourself at Twilio
  
  Join us as Staff Software Engineer for Twilio Stytch’s Agent
  team and help build the future of agent identity. You will
  be a foundational member of a team pioneering the next
  generation of authentication, verification, and identity
  solutions that will empower AI developers and protect users
  globally.
  
  About the job
  
  You will help scale Stytch’s core product as we bring Stytch
  capabilities to Twilio’s full customer base, delivering
  secure, developer-first identity experiences. You’ll design
  and lead implementation of systems that power
  authentication, authorization, and emerging agentic and non-
  human identity use cases. You’ll partner closely with
  product and engineering leadership to set direction, deliver
  high-impact features, and evolve our platform for Twilio’s
  scale. This is a rare chance to operate like a startup
  within Twilio: you’ll work in a high-ownership environment
  with startup speed, backed by Twilio’s reach and scale.
  
  We're seeking a talented Staff Engineer who brings deep
  hands-on technical expertise, a strategic mindset, and a
  passion for building secure, developer-first experiences.
  You'll thrive in this role if you excel at navigating
  ambiguity, enjoy tackling complex technical challenges from
  scratch, and can make critical architectural decisions that
  will shape the foundation of our new identity platforms.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  In this role, you’ll:
  
  - Build and own product capabilities for Stytch’s agentic
    identity platform on Twilio.
  - Design, implement, and maintain scalable, reliable
    distributed services, optimizing for security, latency,
    and developer experience.
  - Partner with Product and Engineering leadership to set
    direction, translate customer needs into technical plans,
    and deliver high-impact roadmap features.
  - Collaborate across Twilio and Stytch teams to align on
    architecture, integrate platform capabilities, and unblock
    cross-team initiatives.
  - Write clean, maintainable, and well-tested code, setting a
    high bar for technical excellence across the team.
  - Own the end-to-end lifecycle of new services, from initial
    design and prototyping through to production deployment
    and operational readiness.
  - Mentor other engineers on the team, fostering a culture of
    innovation, ownership, and continuous learning.
  - Communicate complex technical concepts effectively to
    diverse audiences, from fellow engineers to executive
    leadership.
  - Stay at the forefront of industry trends and emerging
    threats in identity and authentication to ensure our
    products are secure and innovative.
