  trillions of consumer signals to make it easier for
  marketers to acquire, grow, and retain customers more
  efficiently. Through the Zeta Marketing Platform (ZMP), our
  vision is to make sophisticated marketing simple by unifying
  identity, intelligence, and omnichannel activation into a
  single platform – powered by one of the industry’s largest
  proprietary databases and AI. Our enterprise customers
  across multiple verticals are empowered to personalize
  experiences with consumers at an individual level across
  every channel, delivering better results for marketing

  The Role
  
  The Zeta AI R&D team sits at the heart of our technology and
  delivers on Zeta Global’s core brand promise: state-of-the-
  art marketing technology innovation.
  
  What You Will Do
  
  Zeta Global’s technology platform supports a real-time
  bidding system handling over 100 billion events per day, a
  reporting system aggregating and analyzing terabytes of data
  in real time, and a learning system applying machine
  learning and AI techniques to more than 40 petabytes of
  data. Together, these systems ensure Zeta serves the right
  advertisement to the right user at the right time.
  
  At the core of this platform is our Artificial Intelligence
  and Machine Learning team, which builds the models and
  decision-making systems that power Zeta’s products. This
  role is focused on post-training and alignment of large
  language models, with an emphasis on Supervised Fine-Tuning
  (SFT), preference optimization, and production operation of
  agentic LLM systems.
  
  As a Lead AI Engineer, you will own the end-to-end post-
  training lifecycle of LLMs—from SFT data curation and
  training strategy through evaluation, deployment,
  monitoring, and iteration—using platforms such as OpenAI and
  AWS Bedrock.
  
  Specifically, you will:
  
  - Lead Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of large language models
    in production, shaping instruction-following, reasoning
    quality, tone, and domain-specific behavior
  
  - Extend SFT pipelines with instruction tuning and preference-
    based optimization (e.g., RLHF-style approaches or direct
    preference optimization)
  
  - Design, curate, and maintain high-quality SFT and preference
    datasets, combining human-labeled and synthetic data
    tailored to real-world marketing and decisioning use cases
  
  - Own model evaluation and benchmarking, including:
  
  - Offline behavioral evals (instruction adherence, reasoning
    depth, hallucination rates)
  
  - Online experiments and A/B tests
  
  - Continuous regression detection and performance monitoring
  
  - Develop and operate agentic LLM systems, enabling multi-step
    reasoning, tool use, workflow orchestration, and decision
    execution
  
  - Implement and optimize prompting, retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG), memory, and tool-calling strategies,
    with a clear understanding of when to solve problems via
    SFT versus prompting
  
  - Partner closely with data engineering, platform, and product
    teams to integrate fine-tuned models into high-throughput,
    low-latency systems
  
  - Establish best practices for LLM versioning,
    experimentation, deployment, rollback, governance, and
    safety
  - Provide technical leadership and mentorship to engineers
    working on applied AI and LLM systems
  
  Who You Are
  
  You are deeply interested in how LLM behavior changes
  through SFT and post-training, especially in real production
  environments. You enjoy improving models through data,
  evaluation, and iteration—not just prompt engineering. You
  take ownership of outcomes, from model quality and alignment
  to reliability, latency, and cost.
  
  Required Experience and Skills
  
  - Significant hands-on experience with Supervised Fine-Tuning
    (SFT) of LLMs in production, beyond prompt-only approaches
  
  - Direct experience using OpenAI APIs and/or AWS Bedrock for
    SFT, post-training, and deployment
  
  - Strong understanding of LLM post-training workflows,
    including data preparation, instruction tuning, evaluation
    methodologies, and common failure modes
  
  - Experience building and operating agentic LLM systems (tool
    use, multi-step reasoning, workflow orchestration)
  
  - Proficiency in Python and modern ML frameworks (e.g.,
    PyTorch)
  
  - Experience operating ML systems in distributed, production
    environments
  
  - Strong intuition for trade-offs between model quality,
    latency, cost, safety, and scalability
  
  BENEFITS & PERKS
  
  - Unlimited PTO
  - Excellent medical, dental, and vision coverage
  - Employee Equity
  - Employee Discounts, Virtual Wellness Classes, and Pet
    Insurance And more!!
  
  SALARY RANGE
  
  The salary range for this role is $200,000 - $215,000,
  depending on location and experience.
