  About PostHog
  
  We're shipping every product that companies need to run
  their business from their first day, to the day they IPO,
  and beyond. The operating system for folks who build
  software.
  
  We started with open-source product analytics, launched out
  of Y Combinator's W20 cohort. We've since shipped more than
  a dozen products, including:
  
  - A built-in data warehouse, so users can query product and
    customer data together using custom SQL insights.
  - A customer data platform, so they can send their data
    wherever they need with ease.
  - PostHog AI, an AI-powered analyst that answers product
    questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and
    writes custom SQL queries.
  
  Next on the roadmap are CRM, Workflow, revenue analytics,
  and support products. When we say every product that
  companies need to run their business, we really mean it!
  
  We are:
  
  - Product-led. More than 100,000 companies have installed
    PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely
    strong product-market fit.
  - Default alive. Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and
    we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and
    grow faster, not to keep the lights on.
  - Well-funded. We've raised more than $100m from some of the
    world's top investors. We're set up for a long, ambitious
    journey.
  
  We're focused on building an awesome product for end users,
  hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and being as
  weird as possible.
  
  Things we care about
  
  - Transparency: Everyone can read about our roadmap, how we
    pay (or even let go of) people, our strategy, and how we
    work, in our public company handbook. Internally, we share
    revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and
    fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need
    to make good decisions.
  - Autonomy: We don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses
    what to work on next based on what's going to have the
    biggest impact on our customers, and what they find
    interesting and motivating to work on. Engineers lead
    product teams and make product decisions. Teams are
    flexible and easy to change when needed.
  - Shipping fast: Why not now? We want to build a lot of
    products; we can't do that shipping at a normal pace.
    We've built the company around small teams – autonomous,
    highly-efficient groups of cracked engineers who can
    outship much larger companies because they own their
    products end-to-end.
  - Time for building: Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're
    a natively remote company. We default to async
    communication – PRs > Issues > Slack. Tuesdays and
    Thursdays are meeting-free days, and we prioritize heads
    down building time over perfect coordination. This will be
    the most productive job you've ever had.
  - Ambition: We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe
    that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes
    missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic
    about what's possible and our ability to get there.
  - Being weird: Weird means redesigning an already world-class
    website for the 5th time. It means shipping literally
    every product that relates to customer data. It means
    building an objectively unnecessary developer toy with
    dubious shareholder value. Doing weird stuff is a
    competitive advantage. And it's fun.
  
  What you'll be doing
  
  It’s easy to look at how quickly coding is getting better
  and to think we’re already in an amazing place. But, we
  think there’s far further to go, and we think we are
  uniquely able to help the world take the next step.
  
  PostHog is working on product (and then, later, business)
  autonomy.
  
  When you open an editor, you shouldn’t be typing “please
  build me X”, X should already be built for you.
  
  We can do this because PostHog tracks more products across
  more dimensions than any other company on earth. We have
  over a trillion data points across events, errors, session
  replays, revenue data and more. We want to use this data to
  fix bugs, issues, listen to what customers are asking for,
  or internal conversations, and ship those things so
  engineering takes the next step forward - figuring out what
  you want to keep or edit, not waiting for claude to run all
  day.
  
  We have an exceptionally large amount of data relative to
  our company size. This means you can have autonomy, you can
  be close to customers, work on scrappy teams, and greatly
  influence what we actually ship.
  
  On the finance side, we have around $150M in balance, we’re
  super strongly default alive and have had a rapidly growing,
  real business that makes good margin, runs exceptionally
  efficiently, and has already been scaling rapidly, for 6
  years. This won’t be easy. Product autonomy is also the most
  chaotic part of our business - technologies and our own
  ideas are changing rapidly. You will need to want to work on
  something that is uncertain, and may fail. People who are
  proactive, think for themselves, work fast, get product into
  users’ hands and learn are those that are successful here.
  It will be fast and intense. The job will involve training,
  fine tuning and running models to deepen our ability to
  achieve product autonomy. Crucially you will need to be able
  to help us figure out which areas to prioritize as there are
  so many possibilities for game changing things to ship. We
  are building a new team specifically for this purpose,
  working closely with one of the founders. You will need
  either a strong background in maths (and able to code) or to
  have worked on training models previously.
  
  If you have a disability, please let us know if there's any
  way we can make the interview process better for you - we're
  happy to accommodate!
