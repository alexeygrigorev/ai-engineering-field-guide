  and APIs, with a focus on integrating modern AI capabilities
  (via APIs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) into real-

  unique opportunity to lay the foundations and set the right
  technical direction.

    engineering best practices
  - Design and develop appropriate architectures for deploying
    and maintaining scalable AI-enabled solutions on AWS
  - Extend our Terraform infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines
  - Design and implement testing and monitoring components to
    ensure the accuracy, reliability, and performance of AI-
    integrated systems
  - Work with modern agentic workflow orchestration frameworks
    (e.g., LangGraph) to build intelligent workflows
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to ensure the
    successful integration of AI-driven features into our
    product
  - Stay up to date with the latest industry developments in AI
    integration, cloud architecture, and scalable backend
    systems
  
  Qualifications
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Software
    Engineering, or a related field
  - Several years of professional software development
    experience with Python
  - A generalist mindset with the ability to quickly learn,
    adapt to new topics, and switch between domains such as
    infrastructure and backend engineering
  - Experience with Docker, building CI/CD pipelines, and
    version control systems
  - Confidence in working with cloud infrastructure (AWS
    preferred) and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
  - Familiarity with modern agentic workflow orchestration
    frameworks (e.g., LangGraph) would be a plus
  - Strong problem-solving skills, organizational skills, and a
    hands-on mentality
