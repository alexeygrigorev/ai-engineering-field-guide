  At DevRev, we’re building the future of work with Computer –
  your AI teammate.
  
  Computer is not just another tool. It’s built on the belief
  that the future of work should be about genuine human
  connection and collaboration – not piling on more apps.
  Computer is the best kind of teammate: it amplifies your
  strengths, takes repetition and frustration out of your day,
  and gives you more time and energy to do your best work.
  
  How?
  
  Easy: it’s the only platform capable of… Complete data
  unification Most AI products focus on either structured data
  (like CRM records and support tickets), or unstructured data
  (like documents and emails). Computer AirSync connects
  everything, unifying all your data sources (like Google
  Workspace, Jira, Notion) into one AI-ready source of truth:
  Computer Memory. Powerful search, reasoning, and action Once
  connected to all your tools and apps, Computer is embedded
  in your full business context. It can find and summarize,
  sure. Even more impressive: it offers employees insights,
  strategic and proactive suggestions, plus powerful agentic
  actions.
  
  Extensions for your teams and customers Computer doesn’t
  make you choose between new software and old. Its AI-native
  platform lets you extend existing tools with sophisticated
  apps and agents. So your teams – and your customers – can
  take action, seamlessly. These agents work alongside you:
  updating workflows, coordinating across teams, and syncing
  back to your systems.
  
  This isn’t just software. Computer brings people back
  together, breaking down silos and ushering in the future of
  teamwork, through human-AI collaboration. Stop managing
  software. Stop wasting time. Start solving bigger problems,
  building better products, and making your customers happier.
  
  We call this Team Intelligence. It’s why DevRev exists.
  
  Trusted by global companies across multiple industries,
  DevRev is backed by Khosla Ventures and Mayfield, with
  $150M+ raised. We are 650+ people, across eight global
  offices.
