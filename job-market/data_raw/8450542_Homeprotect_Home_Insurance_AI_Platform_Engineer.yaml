  About Homeprotect
  
  We founded Homeprotect on a simple principle – to provide
  protection to people underserved by the home insurance
  industry.
  
  We’re experts at insuring people who want to build or buy a
  unique property, renovate, rent a home or leave it
  unoccupied. We can cover people who travel a lot, run a
  business from home or even collect rare treasures. We
  protect people who love living in a listed building, having
  a view of a river or sunbathing on a flat roof.
  
  We can do this because our smart tech enables our customers
  to get an instant, online quote to cover a huge range of
  complex needs and our UK customer support teams are on hand
  to provide information and support when only a real person
  will do.
  
  Our insurance has already empowered hundreds of thousands of
  people to protect their homes and the things they love. But
  we’re not content with being the leading provider of what’s
  called ‘non-standard’ insurance. We believe there’s no such
  thing as ‘standard’. We’re all unique and we all deserve
  home insurance designed with our individual needs in mind –
  something our combination of real people and smart tech
  enables us to do.
  
  Our simple promise? Whoever you are and wherever you live,
  with Homeprotect we’ve got you covered.
  
  What It's Like To Work Here
  
  Our customers come from all walks of life and so do our
  people. We’re a small but perfectly formed team, made up of
  insurance industry specialists alongside a diverse mix of
  technologists, data scientists and customer and marketing
  champions from all sorts of industries and backgrounds. We
  all bring our individual expertise, an appetite for
  innovation and a shared ambition to empower people to
  protect their homes and the things that they love.
  
  Working in a fast-paced environment where change happens
  regularly is how we do things. But we also recognise that
  you’ll do your best work when you have the right balance,
  which is why we’ve fully embraced hybrid working, giving our
  teams the flexibility to choose the right location and
  working hours for them. We focus on the outputs of work, not
  where it’s completed, with an expectation that colleagues
  spend around one day a week in the office (or a minimum of
  four days per month) to connect and collaborate. There will
  be times when getting together in one location makes sense,
  but day to day, our teams have the freedom to decide where
  to work, and we trust them to balance business needs with
  their own preferences.
  
   Most companies think their culture is great, however at
  Homeprotect, we have the proof to back this up. We have been
  recognised externally as a Great Place to Work for the last
  six consecutive years
