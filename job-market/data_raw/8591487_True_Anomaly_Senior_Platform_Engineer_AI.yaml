level: Expert/Leader
description: |
  A new space race has begun. True Anomaly seeks those with
  the talent and ambition to build innovative technology that
  solves the next generation of engineering, manufacturing,
  and operational challenges for space security and
  sustainability.
  
  OUR MISSION
  
  The peaceful use of space is essential for continued
  prosperity on Earth—from communications and finance to
  navigation and logistics. True Anomaly builds innovative
  technology at the intersection of spacecraft, software, and
  AI to enhance the capabilities of the U.S., its allies, and
  commercial partners. We safeguard global security by
  ensuring space access and sustainability for all.
  
  OUR VALUES
  
  - Be the offset. We create asymmetric advantages with
    creativity and ingenuity
  - What would it take? We challenge assumptions to deliver
    ambitious results
  - It’s the people. Our team is our competitive advantage and
    we are better together
  
  YOUR MISSION
  
  AI-assisted work is the biggest force multiplier available
  to a company at True Anomaly's stage. It accelerates how we
  build, how we deliver, and how we scale. We are investing in
  AI as a core operating capability, not a side experiment,
  and this role exists to help make that investment real.
  
  As a Senior AI Platform Engineer, you will build the
  infrastructure, tooling, and integrations that put AI
  directly into the hands and workflows of every team across
  the company. This is not a research role. It is a building
  role. You will ship capabilities that engineers, program
  managers, operators, and business teams use every day to
  move faster and produce better work.
  
  The scope is broad by design. You may be standing up on-
  premises GPU infrastructure one week, building connectors
  between AI models and internal systems the next, and
  developing a custom application for a specific business
  workflow after that. You will contribute to platform-level
  technical decisions about AI providers, tools, and
  architectures. You will also help build and deliver AI
  training and enablement for the company, including office
  hours, brown bags, and hands-on resources.
  
  This role reports to the Chief Security Officer and works
  across every function. You will have meaningful autonomy,
  direct visibility to executive leadership, and the
  opportunity to shape how a fast-growing defense technology
  company operates with AI.
  
  RESPONSIBILITIES
  
  - Build and maintain AI platform infrastructure: API
    integrations, model access pipelines, system connectors
    (MCP, tool use), and on-premises compute environments as
    needed
  - Develop custom AI-powered applications, workflows, and
    integrations that connect frontier models to internal
    systems such as project management, documentation,
    communications, and operational tools
  - Contribute to technical evaluation and selection of AI
    providers, tools, and platforms, helping inform build-vs-
    buy decisions based on capability, compliance
    requirements, and speed to value
  - Help design and deliver AI training and enablement programs
    for the company, including hands-on workshops, office
    hours, documentation, and shared resources that build real
    fluency across teams
  - Partner with engineering, security, and IT teams to ensure
    AI deployments meet government security and compliance
    requirements across data classification levels
  - Stay current with the rapidly evolving AI landscape and
    surface new models, tools, and capabilities that could
    accelerate the company
  
  QUALIFICATIONS
  
  - Software engineering background with experience building and
    shipping production systems, ideally in Python,
    TypeScript, or similar languages common in AI/ML tooling
  - Hands-on experience with large language model APIs,
    including prompt engineering, tool use, retrieval-
    augmented generation (RAG), or agent frameworks
  - Experience building integrations between software systems
    using APIs, webhooks, data pipelines, or authentication
    flows
  - Ability to work across a broad technical surface area,
    moving between infrastructure, application development,
    and platform work as priorities require
  - Good communication skills and ability to explain technical
    AI concepts to non-technical audiences through training,
    documentation, or direct support
  - Comfortable operating with autonomy in a fast-paced
    environment where priorities shift and the playbook is
    being written in real time
  - Ability to maintain or obtain TS//SCI clearance
  
  PREFERRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE
  
  - Experience deploying AI or ML systems in government,
    defense, or regulated environments with security and
    compliance constraints
  - Familiarity with government cloud environments (AWS
    GovCloud, Azure Government) and authorization frameworks
    (FedRAMP, IL4/IL5)
  - Experience with on-premises GPU infrastructure (NVIDIA,
    CUDA) for model hosting or fine-tuning
  - Background in developer tooling, platform engineering, or
    internal tools teams at high-growth technology companies
  - Experience building knowledge retrieval systems, embedding
    pipelines, or enterprise search infrastructure
  - Currently hold or have previously held a U.S. security
    clearance at any level
  
  COMPENSATION
  
  - Base Salary: $155,000-$215,000
