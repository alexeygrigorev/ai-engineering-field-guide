  About Sprinter Health
  
  At Sprinter Health, our mission is reimagining how people
  access care by bringing it directly to their homes. Nearly
  30% of patients in the U.S. skip preventive or chronic care
  simply because they can’t get to a doctor’s office. For
  many, the ER becomes their first touchpoint with the
  healthcare system—driving over $300B in avoidable costs
  every year.
  
  By using the same technologies that power leading
  marketplace and last-mile platforms, we deliver care where
  people are, especially those who need it most. So far, we’ve
  supported more than 2 million patients across 22 states,
  completed 130,000+ in-home visits, and maintained a 92 NPS.
  Our team of clinicians, technologists, and operators have
  raised over $125M to date from investors like a16z, General
  Catalyst, GV, and Accel and enjoy multi-year runway.
  
  About the Role
  
  We’re building a new Automated Intelligence team to embed AI
  into every layer of our care model—from clinical summaries
  and patient risk predictions to workflow agents and patient
  interactions. This is a 0→1 role for an engineer who wants
  to ship production AI systems quickly, work across complex
  healthcare and logistics data, and build tools that directly
  improve patient outcomes.
  
  Office Location
  
  We are a hybrid company based in the Bay Area with offices
  in both San Francisco and Menlo Park. We care about work-
  life balance and understand that there will be times where
  flexibility is needed.
  
  What you will do:
  
  - Build AI-powered features that improve patient care,
    coordination, and clinical workflows
  - Develop production systems using LLMs, RAG, embeddings, and
    multi-agent architectures
  - Ship products like clinical visit summaries, patient risk
    models, and voice coordination assistants
  - Design workflow agents that automate scheduling, follow-ups,
    and operational tasks
  - Collaborate with product, clinical ops, and data partners to
    deliver measurable results
  - Help define the technical direction, tooling, and standards
    for a brand-new team
  
  What you have done:
  
  - Built and shipped production software end-to-end in fast-
    moving environments
  - Worked with AI/ML systems such as LLMs, RAG pipelines,
    embeddings, or applied NLP
  - Navigated ambiguity and iterated quickly with tight feedback
    loops
  - Designed systems with an eye toward scalability, tradeoffs,
    and real-world constraints
  - Collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver impact
  - (Bonus) Worked with healthcare data formats like FHIR, HL7,
    or clinical documentation
  
  What gives you an edge:
  
  - You’ve shipped AI products—not just prototypes or research
    demos
  - You’ve built systems that interface with real users or
    complex workflows
  - You’ve operated in early-stage or 0→1 environments with high
    ownership
  - You understand reliability, iteration speed, and production
    safety
  - You’re motivated by solving real problems for real people,
    not AI hype
