  ABOUT RETOOL
  
  Nearly every company in the world runs on custom software:
  Gartner estimates that up to 50% of all code is written for
  internal use. This is the operational software for refunding
  orders, underwriting loans, onboarding employees, analyzing
  transactions, and providing customer support. But most
  companies don’t have adequate resources to properly invest
  in these tools, leading to a lot of old and clunky internal
  software or, even worse, users still stuck in manual and
  spreadsheet flows.
  
  At Retool, we’re on a mission to bring good software to
  everyone. We’re building a new type of development platform
  that combines the benefits of traditional software
  development with a drag-and-drop UI editor and AI, making it
  dramatically faster to build internal tools. We believe that
  the future of software development lies in abstracting away
  the tedious and repetitive tasks developers waste time on,
  while creating reusable components that act as a force
  multiplier for future developers and projects. The result is
  not just productivity, but good software by default. And
  that’s a mission worth striving for.
  
  Today, our customers span from small startups building their
  first operational tools to Fortune 500 companies building
  mission-critical apps for thousands of users across their
  business. Interested in joining us? Let us know!
  
  WHY WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOU
  
  Retool started by addressing obstacles with internal tools
  and has grown into a company that solves internal tooling
  for thousands of companies (big and small). Now, with AI-
  native capabilities, we’re going a step further:
  transforming how humans interact with software entirely.
  
  We’re hiring AI Product Engineers to help us push the
  boundaries of what’s possible with LLMs in the hands of
  developers. If you’re passionate about building productized
  AI experiences—fast, reliable, and deeply usable—we want to
  talk.
  
  WHAT YOU'LL DO
  
  As an AI Product Engineer, you’ll work across product and
  infrastructure layers to ship developer-facing AI features
  that feel like magic—intelligent, fast, and deeply embedded
  into the act of building software. You might:
  
  - Build generative UIs that let users create real apps from
    natural language
  - Improve the performance, observability, and safety of our
    internal model architecture
  - Extend our AI evaluation systems to support smarter ranking,
    feedback loops, and product metrics
  - Develop patterns for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
    few-shot prompting, and agentic architecture.
  - Contribute to building internal tools that help us
    accelerate iteration on AI features and workflows
  
  You’ll work in a TypeScript + Node.js + React stack, but we
  value strong engineering fundamentals over specific
  frameworks. You should be comfortable navigating the full
  stack, even if you lean more frontend or backend.
  
  THE SKILLSET YOU'LL BRING
  
  - 3+ years of professional software engineering experience
  - A track record of building and shipping real product—not
    just models or papers
  - Experience working with LLMs and modern techniques (RAG,
    CoT, few-shot, embeddings, etc.)
  - An eye for product: you care how features work and how they
    feel
  - Familiarity with vector databases, prompt orchestration
    tools, and evaluation techniques
  - A pragmatic mindset about what’s scalable and maintainable
    in production
  - Strong opinions, weakly held—you move quickly but bring
    others along
  - Bonus: experience building AI features for developer tools
    or productivity software
  
  WHO YOU'LL WORK WITH
  
  You’ll join a small, fast-moving AI team inside Retool,
  working alongside engineers, designers, and PMs who’ve built
  everything from visual programming systems to compiler
  infrastructure. You’ll also collaborate with our core
  product and infra teams as we deepen AI’s role across the
  platform.
  
  We value ownership, speed, and a tight feedback loop with
  our customers (many of whom are developers themselves). This
  is a unique opportunity to work at the intersection of AI,
  developer experience, and product design—with real users,
  real use cases, and real impact.
  
  NICE TO HAVE
  
  - Experience in JavaScript / TypeScript
  - Experience with PostgreSQL
  - Exposure to MLOps techniques (e.g., fine-tuning pipelines,
    model hosting)
  - Experience mentoring other engineers or working closely with
    design
  
  READY TO BUILD THE FUTURE OF SOFTWARE?
  
  If you’re excited to shape how developers build with AI—from
  prompts to production—we’d love to meet you.
