  Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) Workflow Engineer
  
  Cooley is seeking an Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) Workflow
  Engineer to join the Practice Engineering team within the
  Innovation department.
  
  Position summary: As the leading technology law firm, Cooley
  is determined to become a leader in the digital practice of
  law. Cooley Innovation embraces a culture of customer
  service excellence, and all members of the department are
  expected to move this agenda forward. To that end, under the
  direction of the Manager of Product Engineering, and
  collaborating directly with practitioners, technical teams,
  and innovation stakeholders, the Artificial Intelligence
  (“AI”) Workflow Engineer leads process automation
  initiatives by driving prototype-based discovery and
  building functional workflow demonstrations that validate
  repeatable, end-to-end processes—from defined inputs through
  tool orchestration to outputs that meet specified acceptance
  criteria. This includes developing multi-step automations
  that combine deterministic scripting with AI workflows,
  including advanced prompting, retrieval-augmented generation
  (RAG), and agentic techniques. This role partners across
  multiple domains including Practice Innovation, Knowledge
  Management, Software Engineering, as well as resource
  attorneys and other practitioners across a range of offices
  and practice areas. Specific duties and responsibilities
  include, but are not limited to, the following:
  
  Position responsibilities:
  
  - Responsible for the management, design and development and
    testing of legal workflow automations, form-building
    solutions and expert knowledge systems
  - Elicit attorney/practitioner requirements, map end-to-end
    process steps, define decision points and failure modes,
    and produce clear acceptance criteria and test cases that
    make the workflow measurable and reviewable
  - Rapidly build and iterate working proofs-of-concept that
    validate feasibility of repeatable processes, combining
    deterministic logic (rules/scripting) with AI steps
    (prompting, retrieval, tool-use/agents) to produce usable
    outputs aligned to acceptance criteria
  - Working with Knowledge Management and practitioners,
    create/maintain the workflow’s “source of truth”
    (playbooks, templates, matter-type guidance, clause
    libraries, FAQs), implement retrieval strategies and
    citation/traceability expectations, and partner with
    attorneys to ensure substantive content accuracy and
    ongoing governance of knowledge updates
  - Evaluate AI and technology components; design measurable
    validation workflows (including Python-based integrations)
    to test use cases, assess feasibility, and generate
    stakeholder-ready findings
  - Build RPA workflows and API integrations to measure and
    report adoption and performance; deliver executive-facing
    analytics that enable leadership advocacy and decision-
    making
  - Design and maintain knowledge applications, including
    working with Knowledge Management and attorneys to ensure
    substantive legal content is accurate
  - Coordinate training, support, documentation and resource
    material in support of processes and systems
  - Engage with end-users to gather feedback, observe and map
    routines and processes

    including business end-user requirements, user and
