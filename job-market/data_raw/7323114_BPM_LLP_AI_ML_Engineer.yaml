  About the role:
  
  We are seeking an AI/ML Engineer to join BPM’s Enterprise
  Technology Solutions team. This role is for a builder —
  someone who doesn’t just experiment with AI but makes it
  work inside the firm at scale. You’ll take AI tools and
  models and embed them into BPM’s day-to-day operations,
  ensuring they deliver real business value.
  
  In this role, you’ll design and develop AI-powered
  applications — from chatbots and copilots to workflow
  automations — that streamline processes across Tax,
  Assurance, Advisory, and our Corporate Services Team. You’ll
  partner with teams to spot opportunities where AI can cut
  manual effort, increase accuracy, and speed up delivery,
  then turn those opportunities into working solutions.
  
  At BPM, this isn’t about chasing hype — it’s about applying
  AI where it matters most and seeing your work make an
  immediate impact. You’ll be part of standing up a brand-new
  AI-focused development team, not only building solutions but
  also shaping the team’s processes, tools, and standards.
  This is a chance to learn new technologies, push technical
  boundaries, and set the foundation for how AI gets delivered
  across the firm. Success in this role means turning ideas
  into reliable solutions colleagues can depend on — helping
  BPM move faster, work smarter, and stay ahead in a rapidly
  changing industry.
  
  
  
  Key Responsibilities:
  
  
  
  Model Development: Design and evaluate AI/ML models tailored
  to BPM use cases (e.g., tax AI bot, Copilot extensions).
  
  Data Engineering: Prepare and manage structured and
  unstructured datasets, ensuring quality inputs for training
  and evaluation.
  
  AI Integration: Build and deploy AI features into BPM
  systems and workflows, using tools like Copilot Studio,
  Azure OpenAI, and Power Platform.
  
  Automation: Deliver automation solutions that streamline
  operations and reduce manual effort for Tax, Assurance, and
  Advisory practices.
  
  Collaboration: Work closely with IT, business stakeholders,
  and data governance teams to identify use cases and ensure
  solutions align with firm goals.
  
  Experimentation & Innovation: Rapidly prototype AI
  solutions, test emerging tools, and recommend best practices
  for adoption.
  
  Governance & Quality: Apply responsible AI practices,
  ensuring models are accurate, explainable, and compliant
  with BPM’s standards.
