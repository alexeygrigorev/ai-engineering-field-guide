  At Prodigal, we are building AI Agents for loan servicing
  and collections. Founded in 2018 by IITB alumni, our journey
  began with one bold mission: to eradicate the inefficiencies
  and confusion that have plagued the lending and collections
  industry for decades. We are backed by Y Combinator, Accel
  and Menlo Ventures.
  
  Today, we stand at the forefront of a seismic shift in the
  industry, building Agentic AI applications for consumer
  finance. Powered by our cutting-edge platform, Prodigal’s
  Intelligence Engine (PIE), we’re creating the next-
  generation agentic workforce - one that empowers companies
  to achieve unprecedented levels of operational excellence
  and intelligence.
  
  With over half a billion consumer finance interactions
  processed and a growing impact on more than 100 leading
  companies across North America, we’ve established ourselves
  as the go-to partner for organizations that demand more from
  their AI solutions. Our unparalleled experience, coupled
  with our trusted customer relationships, uniquely positions
  us to build Agentic AI applications that will revolutionize
  the future of consumer finance.
  
  At Prodigal, we are driven by a singular, unrelenting
  purpose: to transform how consumer finance companies engage
  with their customers and, in turn, drive successful outcomes
  for all.
  
  Lead AI Engineer About the Role
  
  We're looking for a Tech Lead to own the technical direction
  of proAgent's core architecture. You'll lead a small, high-
  agency team building AI Agents that handle nuanced financial
  conversations-where every millisecond of latency and every
  reasoning decision matters.
  
  This is a player-coach role. You'll write code, make
  architectural decisions, and set the technical bar for how
  we build intelligent, low-latency voice agents.
  
  What You'll OwnAgent Loop & Reasoning
  
  - Design the agentic runtime that powers natural, multi-turn
    conversations while executing complex business logic
    (payment negotiations, compliance guardrails, objection
    handling)
  - Build primitives that balance conversational fluidity with
    structured reasoning-the agent needs to feel human while
    making verifiable decisions
  - Create context management systems that track consumer state,
    conversation history, and business rules across long,
    branching dialogues
  
  Voice AI Systems
  
  - Architect our real-time voice pipeline for sub-1s latency
    across transcription, reasoning, and synthesis
  - Own VAD tuning, and turn-taking logic that makes
    conversations feel natural
  - Evaluate and integrate speech models (STT, TTS, speech-to-
    speech) as the landscape evolves-we currently work with
    ElevenLabs and Cartesia for Text to Speech, and Deepgram
    for Speech to Text, and are always exploring what's next
  - Debug and optimize streaming audio and WebRTC
  
  LLM Infrastructure
  
  - Design our prompting, orchestration, and model routing
    strategies
  - Build evaluation frameworks that measure agent quality
    beyond accuracy-conversation quality, empathy, compliance
    adherence
  - Stay current on model capabilities and make pragmatic build-
    vs-integrate decisions
  
  Technical Leadership
  
  - Set architectural direction for proAgent platform and
    surrounding applications
  - Mentor engineers and establish engineering practices that
    scale
  - Partner with Product and Client teams to translate customer
    problems into technical roadmaps
  - Make tradeoffs between shipping fast and building durable
    systems-we need both
  
  What You Bring
  
  - 4+ years building production systems, with 1+ years in a
    Lead for a project
  - Hands-on work with LLMs in production: prompt engineering,
    orchestration, evaluation
  - High bias for action to see things to production - real-time
    systems can get gnarly, and truly high bias is needed to
    take things to production
  - Strong fundamentals in Python and TypeScript
  - Clear technical communication-you can explain complex
    tradeoffs to engineers and stakeholders alike
  
  Even Better
  
  - Experience with voice AI: speech recognition, synthesis,
    telephony systems
  - Background in fintech, lending, or collections
  - Experience with Twilio, LiveKit, ElevenLabs, or similar
    real-time infrastructure
  - You've built agentic systems that combine LLM reasoning with
    structured actions
  - Track record of building and scaling small teams
  
  Why This Role
  
  - High leverage: proAgent is poised to handle millions of live
    consumer conversations every day. Your architectural
    decisions directly impact business outcomes.
  - Frontier work: Voice AI that reasons, decides, and acts is
    one of the hardest problems in applied AI. We're building
    it.
  - Ownership: Small team, big scope. You'll shape what proAgent
    becomes.
  
  From day 1, Prodigal has been defined by talented, humble,
  and hungry leaders and we want this mindset and culture to
  continue to blossom from top to bottom in the company. If
  you have an entrepreneurial spirit and want to work in a
  fast-paced, intellectually-stimulating environment where you
  will be pushed to grow, then please reach out because we are
  looking to build a transformational company that reinvents
  one of the biggest industries in the US.
