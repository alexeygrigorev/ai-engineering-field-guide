  Role overview:
  
  The AI Engineer owns the full lifecycle of AI-driven
  workflows across the organisation. This role is accountable
  not only for technical implementation but also for the
  quality, reliability, and outcomes of AI systems in
  production. You will design and operate end‑to‑end AI
  workflows that connect with internal systems, manage model
  behaviour, ensure decision accuracy, and continuously
  improve performance through measurement and iteration. This
  role requires a blend of software engineering excellence, AI
  systems understanding, and a strong product mindset focused
  on real‑world impact.
  
  What you will do
  
  End-to-End AI Workflow Ownership
  
  - Design and build production‑grade AI workflows integrated
    across internal systems (HR, Finance, Ops, CRM, etc.).
  - Implement orchestration logic including triggers, retries,
    fallbacks, and human‑in‑the‑loop mechanisms.
  - Ensure workflows are reliable, observable, monitored, and
    auditable.
  
  AI & Model Behaviour
  
  - Develop and maintain AI agents, prompts, retrieval
    pipelines, and decision logic.
  - Own and monitor model behaviour in production, including:
    - Accuracy and usefulness
    - Failure modes
    - Handling of edge cases and ambiguity
  - Improve model performance using evaluation frameworks,
    feedback loops, and real usage data.
  
  Decision Quality & Outcomes
  
  - Take accountability for the quality of decisions produced by
    AI systems, beyond technical execution.
  - Define, track, and report success metrics (e.g., accuracy,
    resolution rate, time saved).
  - Diagnose situations where systems function technically but
    deliver suboptimal outcomes.
  
  Collaboration & Platform Usage
  
  - Work closely with Data Engineering to leverage shared
    platforms:
    - Infrastructure
    - CI/CD
    - Data pipelines
    - Security & governance
  - Contribute to shared standards, schemas, and best practices
    for AI systems.
  
  What Success Looks Like
  
  - AI workflows run reliably in production with minimal manual
    interventions.
  - Business users trust and rely on AI‑generated outputs.
  - Model behaviour improves consistently over time through
    structured evaluation.
  - Clear ownership and accountability when issues arise — no
    gaps.
  
  Who you are
  
  Core Skills & Experience
  
  - Strong software engineering background (Python or similar).
  - Proven experience building production systems (not just
    prototypes).
  - Hands‑on experience with AI/ML systems (LLMs, classifiers,
    decision models, etc.).
  - Skilled in API integration and working with distributed
    systems.
  
  AI & Data Expertise
  
  - Experience designing prompts, retrieval pipelines, or ML
    inference workflows.
  - Understanding of model evaluation, monitoring, and feedback
    loops.
  - Comfortable working with structured and unstructured data.
  
  Mindset
  
  - Product‑oriented with a strong focus on outcomes, not just
    code delivery.
  - Comfortable navigating ambiguity and making pragmatic trade-
    offs.
  - Practical and grounded in building AI that works reliably in
    real-world production environments.
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Experience with workflow orchestration tools (e.g.,
    Temporal, Airflow, Step Functions).
  - Experience developing internal tools or AI agents.
  - Familiarity with regulated or enterprise environments.
  - Exposure to MLOps or AI evaluation frameworks.
