  ABOUT THE ROLE
  
  Be at the forefront of the AI revolution, working on
  cutting-edge projects that shape the future of financial
  services. You’ll join a passionate team focused on building
  high-quality, scalable products with real-world impact.
  
  We’re looking for a Staff-level Backend Engineer (AI) to
  bridge robust backend systems with Generative AI. You’ll
  design the frameworks, standards, and platforms that allow
  AI capabilities to scale securely, reliably, and efficiently
  across the enterprise, going beyond feature delivery to
  influence long-term technical direction.
  
  As a Staff Engineer you’ll be:
  
  Technical Leadership & Strategy
  
  - System Architect: You have a proven track record of
    designing, building, and operating enterprise-scale
    distributed systems. You think in terms of long-term
    scalability, maintainability, and subsequent operations.
  - Strategic Execution: You excel at managing multiple high-
    priority initiatives, balancing "building it right" with
    "building it fast." You can translate vague business goals
    into concrete technical roadmaps.
  - Cross-Functional Influence: You act as a technical partner
    to product, design, and non-engineering stakeholders,
    ensuring that our AI capabilities drive genuine business
    value.
  
  Generative AI & Machine Learning Excellence
  
  - Production-Grade GenAI: You have experience deploying
    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Agentic workflows
    (e.g. LangGraph) in production environments.
  - Evaluation, Monitoring and Optimization: You understand that
    GenAI is only as good as its evaluation. You are familiar
    with ways to quantify and track the quality of outputs
    (e.g. via RAGAS) and optimizing for latency and cost.
  - End-to-End Lifecycle: You possess a deep understanding of
    the AI/ML lifecycle—from data curation and vector database
    indexing to model monitoring and guardrail implementation.
  
  Backend Engineering Mastery
  
  - Python Expert: You are a seasoned Python developer with a
    deep understanding of its ecosystem, asynchronous
    programming, and performance tuning.
  - Infrastructure as Code: You are comfortable in cloud-native
    environments (AWS/GCP), leveraging Docker, Kubernetes, and
    GitHub Actions to create seamless CI/CD pipelines.
  - Data Architecture: You have a solid foundation in both
    relational databases and modern data warehouses like
    BigQuery, specifically how they interface with AI/ML
    workloads.
  
  Mindset & Mentorship
  
  - Force Multiplier: You enjoy mentoring senior and mid-level
    engineers, conducting high-impact code reviews, and
    raising the bar for engineering excellence across the
    team.
  - Pragmatic Innovator: You are passionate about the latest AI
    trends but remain grounded in solving real-world problems
    with the most effective (and sometimes simplest) tool.
  
  WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR:
  
  - 10+ years of experience building and operating scalable
    backend systems in production
  - Strong hands-on experience with Python in cloud-native
    environments
  - Proven experience designing distributed systems,
    microservices, and REST APIs
  - Experience building production-grade Generative AI systems,
    including RAG and agentic workflows
  - Solid understanding of AI evaluation, monitoring, and
    optimisation (quality, latency, cost)
  - Experience working across the end-to-end AI lifecycle,
    including data pipelines and vector databases
  - Strong knowledge of cloud infrastructure, Docker,
    Kubernetes, and CI/CD practices
  - Experience with relational databases and data platforms
    supporting AI workloads
  - A hands-on technical leader who influences architecture and
    stays close to the code
  - Ability to translate business problems into clear technical
    solutions and communicate effectively with non-technical
    stakeholders
  
  WHAT YOU’LL GET IN RETURN
  
  - Competitive Compensation -  competitive salary and share
    options
  - Time Off – Generous annual leave on top of bank holidays.
  - Parental Leave – Paid maternity, paternity, and adoption
    leave to support your family journey.
  - Sabbatical – Extended unpaid and paid leave options after
    completing milestone years with Tide.
  - Health Insurance – Private family insurance with additional
    OPD coverage and top-up options.
  - Life & Accident Cover – Comprehensive accidental and life
    insurance protection.
  - Mental Wellbeing – Access to therapy sessions, courses,
    meditations, and workshops.
  - Volunteering & Development Days – Paid days annually for
    volunteering or personal growth.
  - Learning & Development – Annual budget for books, courses,
    coaching, and more.
  - WOO (Work Outside the Office) – Work from abroad for up to
    90 days annually.
  - Home Office Setup – Contribution towards setting up your
    home office
  - Laptop Ownership – Keep your old laptop and get a new one
    when it’s time for a replacement.
  - Snacks & Meals – Office perks with snacks, coffee, tea, and
    lunch (location dependent).
