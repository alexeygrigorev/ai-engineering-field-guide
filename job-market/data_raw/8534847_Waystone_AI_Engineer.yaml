  Summary: Reporting to the AI & Technology Oversight Manager,
  the AI Engineer is responsible for embedding artificial
  intelligence capabilities into Waystone’s engineering,
  automation, and assurance ecosystems. Acting as a bridge
  between cutting‑edge AI technologies and existing high‑code
  and low‑code platforms, the role focuses on AI enablement
  rather than foundational model building, ensuring
  intelligence is thoughtfully integrated into systems and
  workflows. The AI Engineer designs, develops, and assures
  AI-enabled solutions, improves automation efficiency,
  elevates engineering quality, and mentors teams on
  responsible and effective AI adoption. The mission is to
  drive innovation, productivity, and intelligent automation
  across Waystone while upholding compliance, security, and
  architectural integrity. The role requires strong hands‑on
  engineering skills, practical understanding of agentic AI
  patterns, and the ability to guide teams on effective and
  responsible AI usage.
  
  ESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
  
  AI Enablement and Integration:
  
  - Hands-on contributor to the design and development of AI-
    enabled solutions, capable of writing both production-
    quality code and rapid experimental prototypes.
  - Develop and implement AI‑enabled microservices, APIs,
    applications, and internal tools.
  - Integrate AI capabilities following secure, scalable
    engineering best practices.
  - Design, build and validate AI‑driven solutions leveraging
    providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic.
  - Enhance low‑code/no‑code automation platforms (e.g., Power
    Automate, n8n, Workato) by embedding intelligent
    processing and applying agentic patterns where relevant.
  - Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for secure
    AI‑to‑system connectivity.
  - Lead AI‑based document parsing and intelligent data
    extraction initiatives.
  - Contribute to educating and enabling Enterprise Capabilities
    areas, including Integration and Automation, by providing
    guidance, training, and best practices, e.g., on effective
    use of n8n agents.
  - Engage with business stakeholders to understand
    requirements, constraints, and key drivers, identifying
    and implementing high‑value AI opportunities across
    Waystone.
  
          AI Engineering:
  
  - Prototype AI features and iterate towards production‑ready
    capabilities.
  - Build agentic workflows using frameworks such as LangChain
    or Microsoft Agent Framework, with a solid understanding
    of agent fundamentals (tools, memory, orchestration,
    context control).
  - Implement AI agents with tool integration, memory, context
    control, and guardrails.
  - Develop retrieval‑augmented workflows to enhance context,
    reliability, and performance.
  - Perform quality assurance on AI outputs by implementing
    robust AI observability practices, including monitoring
    model behaviour, detecting anomalies, and ensuring
    visibility into AI performance and reliability.
  - Contribute to ongoing research and development, staying
    current with emerging AI tools, frameworks, and techniques
    to identify opportunities for innovation and improvement.
  - Apply sound judgment to determine when not to use AI,
    ensuring traditional deterministic solutions are chosen
    when they are safer, simpler, or more cost effective.
  - Ensure AI-enabled solutions consider full total cost of
    ownership, including token consumption, performance,
    observability, and ongoing maintenance, with awareness of
    cost‑efficiency and model‑selection trade‑
  
           Knowledge Sharing, Mentoring and Governance:
  
  - Mentor and support both technical and non‑technical staff
    (e.g. citizen developers), fostering knowledge sharing and
    strengthening AI fluency across Waystone.
  - Act as AI subject matter expert for engineering, testing,
    architecture teams, as well as business functions across
    the wider organisation. Deliver demos, internal
    evangelism, and produce reference documentation.
  - Nurture the wider internal community, helping uplift AI
    adoption and responsible, high‑value usage across the
    business.
  - Lead the design and documentation of AI-enabled solutions,
    contributing to Solution In Principle (SIP) or Solution
    Architecture Design (SAD) documents as needed.
  - Collaborate with delivery teams throughout the project
    lifecycles, offering guidance on AI-enabled solutions and
    addressing technical challenges as they arise.
  - Develop internal best practices for prompt engineering, AI-
    processed data handling, AI-assisted coding, creation and
    sharing of custom agents, and responsible AI usage.
  - Contribute to AI governance, ethics, compliance, and risk
    control activities.
  - Ensure AI solutions comply with enterprise architecture
    principles, security policies, data governance standards,
    human-in-the-loop controls, and regulatory requirements.
  - Monitor and mitigate AI risks, raising concerns early and
    recommending remedial actions.
