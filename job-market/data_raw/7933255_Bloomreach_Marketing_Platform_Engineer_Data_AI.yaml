  Bloomreach is building the world’s premier agentic platform
  for personalization.We’re revolutionizing how businesses
  connect with their customers, building and deploying AI
  agents to personalize the entire customer journey.
  
  - We're taking autonomous search mainstream, making product
    discovery more intuitive and conversational for customers,
    and more profitable for businesses.
  - We’re making conversational shopping a reality, connecting
    every shopper with tailored guidance and product expertise
    — available on demand, at every touchpoint in their
    journey.
  - We're designing the future of autonomous marketing, taking
    the work out of workflows, and reclaiming the creative,
    strategic, and customer-first work marketers were always
    meant to do.
  
  And we're building all of that on the intelligence of a
  single AI engine — Loomi AI — so that personalization isn't
  only autonomous…it's also consistent.From retail to
  financial services, hospitality to gaming, businesses use
  Bloomreach to drive higher growth and lasting loyalty. We
  power personalization for more than 1,400 global brands,
  including American Eagle, Sonepar, and Pandora.
  
  Bloomreach is seeking a Context Layer & Platform Engineer to
  architect and maintain the intelligent data backbone
  powering our GTM AI ecosystem. In this role, you will work
  hand-in-hand with the AI Ops team, Sales, and Marketing to
  design and scale a centralized, real-time context retrieval
  system that serves 50-200 GTM agents with precision, speed,
  and minimal noise. You'll engineer the architecture so that
  agents call clean, versioned endpoints to access the right
  data at the right time, in the right channel, at the right
  freshness - without redundant work or data drift. You'll own
  Salesforce data quality, enrichment, and deduplication while
  simultaneously building the infrastructure that makes our
  agents smarter, faster, and more reliable. The ideal
  candidate combines deep technical expertise in data
  pipelines and API architecture with product thinking about
  how data flows through systems, thrives solving complex
  orchestration challenges, and is motivated to turn messy
  data into intelligence at scale.
  
  Your job will be to:
  
  - Own Salesforce data integrity: Take responsibility for data
    quality, deduplication, and enrichment across Salesforce.
    Use AI enriching accounts and contacts with the right
    data, eliminating duplicates, standardizing fields,
    validating data freshness, and ensuring that all context
    flowing through the system is reliable. You are the keeper
    of the single source of truth.
  - Engineer the context retrieval backbone: Design and ship
    versioned, documented API endpoints that GTM agents call
    to retrieve context - contacts, accounts, engagement
    history, intent signals, enrichment data - with consistent
    response contracts, fast latency, and intelligent
    filtering/boosting/time-decay logic. These endpoints
    become the foundation for scaling from 10 to 200 agents.
  - Optimize retrieval performance: Continuously tune query
    logic, filters, boosts, and ranking algorithms so answers
    are contextually relevant, fast (sub-second latency), and
    cost-effective. Every agent query should return signal,
    not noise.
  - Scale “GTM Brain” data sources without breaking agents: Add
    new sources - product usage, web signals, third-party
    enrichment, intent platforms - to the context layer
    without forcing agents to rebuild their logic. Design the
    system so agents stay stable while context grows richer.
  - Keep context fresh and resilient: Build and operate
    background jobs that refresh context on schedule, detect
    and fix failed re-embeddings, backfill deltas, and
    maintain data pipelines that feed agents with up-to-date
    intelligence without disruption or drift.
  - Enable agent developers and operators: Create starter
    queries and templated context patterns that new agents can
    adopt quickly. Coordinate with the enablement and AI Ops
    teams to make context accessible to non-engineers.
  - Collaborate on vendor strategy: Help evaluate, integrate,
    and own relationships with key vendors like N8N, Clay,
    Rattle - ensuring their data flows cleanly into your
    context architecture and meets our latency and freshness
    requirements.
  - Participate in building the GTM data stack of the future:
    Work with RevOps, and AI Ops to understand how Salesforce,
    enrichment platforms, N8N, Supabase/Postgres, LLM tools,
    and analytics integrate - co-creating a scalable,
    maintainable system that can grow to support 200+ agents
    without technical debt.
  
  Your success story will be:
  
  - Within the first 30-60 days: The first set of centralized
    context endpoints are shipped, versioned, and documented.
    At least 3 existing agents are migrated from custom
    context logic to calling these endpoints. Salesforce data
    quality audit is complete, enrichment roadmap is clear,
    and foundational data cleanup is underway.
  - After 60-90 days: GTM Brain architecture designed, Clear
    context layer roadmap to BigQuery, SFDC and others defined
    and in works.
  - By 6 months: 15-20 agents are operating on the platform
    connected to GTM Brain. Salesforce data quality has
    improved by 40%+ (measured by duplicate rates, field
    completeness, freshness). A new data source (usage
    signals, enrichment vendor, etc.) has been integrated
    without disrupting existing agents. The context layer is
    stable and predictable enough that the AI Ops team
    confidently plans to scale to 50+ agents.
  
  You have the following experience and qualities:
  
  - You've built or scaled data pipelines, ETL systems, or API
    backends that serve multiple downstream consumers - and
    understand the discipline of versioning, backward
    compatibility, and operational stability.
  - You know Salesforce deeply - data model, custom objects,
    field governance, deduplication strategies, API
    limitations - and can architect data quality processes
    that scale.
  - You're expert with N8N, Supabase/Postgres, and API
    integrations. You can design schemas, optimize queries,
    version APIs, and think about performance at scale. You've
    built systems that balance flexibility with simplicity.
  - You understand LLM-adjacent tooling and can reason about
    prompt versioning, retrieval quality, latency trade-offs,
    and how to structure data so agents consume it
    predictably.
  - You love operational rigor - monitoring, alerting,
    observability, runbooks. You believe that boring
    infrastructure is good infrastructure, and you want to
    measure and communicate it.
  - You're comfortable with ambiguity and can break down a big
    architectural challenge ("serve 200 agents with consistent
    context") into testable, shippable milestones.
  - You thrive in cross-functional environments and can
    translate between data engineers, product teams, AI
    researchers, and business stakeholders. You can speak both
    technical and business language.
  - You're driven by the challenge of turning messy data into
    clean intelligence - and seeing that intelligence power
    products and decisions in real time.
  - You're curious about how GTM works and motivated to
    understand not just the "what" but the "why" - so you
    build systems that are useful, not just technically sound.
  - You have strong project ownership instincts - you see things
    through from design to maintenance, and you take pride in
    systems that run reliably at scale.
