  solutions. WHAT YOU WILL EXPERIENCE IN THIS POSITION: As an
  nVent AI/ML Engineer, you will design, develop, and deploy
  production AI/ML solutions that deliver measurable business
  value across our $4B global organization. Working within our
  Data & Analytics organization, you'll leverage our
  enterprise Snowflake data platform and AWS infrastructure to
  build models that address real business challenges. The
  ideal candidate combines strong ML engineering skills with
  the ability to translate business problems into technical
  solutions, deploy production-grade systems, and work
  effectively with business stakeholders who may have limited
  AI expertise. Key Responsibilities • Solution Development o
  Partner with business stakeholders to understand challenges
  and translate those challenges into AI/ML solution delivery
  o Design and implement ML models and AI solutions that
  address specific business problems with measurable ROI (cost
  reduction, revenue growth, efficiency gains) o Conduct
  feasibility assessments for proposed AI use cases,
  evaluating data availability, technical approach, and
  expected business value o Present findings and
  recommendations to business leaders and technical audiences,
  adjusting communication style for varying levels of AI
  literacy • Model Development & Deployment o Build, train,
  validate, and deploy machine learning models using Snowflake
  ML capabilities and AWS services (SageMaker, Bedrock,
  Lambda) o Implement generative AI solutions leveraging large
  language models (LLMs), Langchain and Streamlit for
  applications such as document processing, content
  generation, conversational AI, and knowledge management o
  Develop natural language processing (NLP) solutions for text
  analysis, sentiment detection, entity extraction, and
  automated classification o Create computer vision
  applications for quality inspection, safety monitoring, and
  document understanding o Establish MLOps practices including
  model versioning, monitoring, retraining pipelines, and
  performance tracking o Implement human-in-the-loop workflows
  for high-stakes decisions requiring human oversight o Design
  and implement MCP servers to manage structured context for
  AI agents • Data Engineering & Platform Integration o Work
  within our centralized Snowflake data platform to access and
  prepare data from multiple source systems o Create chunking
  and manage vector databases utilizing Snowflake Cortex to
  enable efficient semantic search and retrieval for
  generative AI applications. o Perform feature engineering,

  model training data meets requirements The role needs
  someone who knows common machine learning design patterns
  and can build models in a clear and repeatable way, key
  being repeatable. It also needs someone who can write and
  tune prompts for LLM work and understands how small changes
  can shape model behavior. o Build data pipelines that
  support model training, inference, and monitoring at scale o
  Integrate AI/ML solutions with existing business systems
  through APIs and automated processes o • Governance & Best
  Practices o Follow NIST AI Risk Management Framework
  principles in all AI development activities o Document model
  architecture, training data characteristics, performance
  metrics, and limitations for governance and audit
  requirements o Implement appropriate testing, validation,
  and error handling for production AI systems o Support
  compliance requirements including data privacy (GDPR, CCPA),
  export controls, and industry-specific regulations o
  Contribute to organizational AI standards, best practices,
