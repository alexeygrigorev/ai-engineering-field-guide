  operate in a global, remote-first environment. We are
  building more than software; we are building a global
  community rooted in creativity, collaboration, and impact.
  We take pride in cultivating a culture where innovation

  with customers, and making their mark - and we get to help
  make that happen.
  
  About the Role:
  
  At HighLevel, we are redefining what it means to be an
  "Engineer." We envision a new era of engineering where
  individual builders are empowered by AI to act as an entire
  product squad. The "Team of One" is a unique, high-autonomy
  role designed for the ultimate 0 to 1 builder.
  
  In this role, you don't just write code, you own the entire
  outcome. Leveraging a sophisticated AI-native stack, you
  will navigate the full SDLC, from product strategy and UI/UX
  design to full-stack implementation and automated QA. You
  aren't just an "individual contributor"; you are a self-
  contained unit of innovation.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Product: Act as your own requirements enhancer. Use AI to
    define requirements, and translate business goals into
    technical specifications while keeping cost and scale in
    mind
  - UX/UI: Take ownership of the user journey. Utilize AI-
    assisted design tools to build intuitive, high-fidelity
    interfaces that align with our design system
  - Full-Stack Engineering: Build, ship, and scale. You will
    implement features across the entire stack, utilizing AI
    coding agents to handle boilerplate and complex
    refactoring while you focus on high-level architecture and
    logic. You will be equipped with the finest internal tools
    to aid you in this endeavor
  - Quality Assurance: Own the reliability of your shipments.
    You will design and orchestrate AI-driven test suites that
    ensure near-zero regression and high performance
  - 0 to 1 Building: Lead new initiatives from a blank page to a
    production-ready feature, maintaining a relentless pace of
    iteration.
  - Team Validation: While you maintain ultimate ownership of
    your work, a dedicated team — comprising product, design,
    senior staff engineers, and quality assurance—will review,
    validate and share feedback around the completed work
    before it is deployed to production
  
  Requirements:
  
  - Industry Experience: 4+ years of experience as a software
    engineer
  - Technical Skills: This is a full-stack role with hands-on
    frontend skills (Vue.js or React.js or Angular) and
    backend experience in Node.js or Java or Python. Nice to
    have experience with Vue.js and Node.js
  - AI-First Mindset: You don't just "use" AI; it is the
    backbone of your workflow. You are an expert at prompt
    engineering and orchestrating multi-agent systems to
    multiply your output across the entire SDLC
  - Customer-First Philosophy: You understand that technology
    exists to solve business problems. You build with the end-
    user in mind, ensuring every line of code adds tangible
    value
  - 0 to 1 Expertise: You have a proven track record of building
    products from scratch. You thrive in ambiguity and enjoy
    the challenge of "figuring it out."
  - Full SDLC Fluency: You are comfortable wearing multiple
    hats-Designer today, Architect tomorrow, QA Lead the day
    after.
  - Philosophy: You align with a culture of practical learning
    and high autonomy. You believe in building sustainable,
    bootstrapped-mindset solutions that scale
