  About Lendable
  
  Lendable is on a mission to build the world's best
  technology to help people get credit and save money. We're
  building one of the world’s leading fintech companies and
  are off to a strong start:
  
  - One of the UK’s newest unicorns with a team of just over 700
    people
  - Among the fastest-growing tech companies in the UK
  - Profitable since 2017
  - Backed by top investors including Balderton Capital and
    Goldman Sachs
  - Loved by customers with the best reviews in the market (4.9
    across 10,000s of reviews on Trustpilot)
  
  So far, we’ve rebuilt the Big Three consumer finance
  products from scratch: loans, credit cards and car finance.
  We get money into our customers’ hands in minutes instead of
  days.
  
  We’re growing fast, and there’s a lot more to do: we’re
  going after the two biggest Western markets (UK and US)
  where trillions worth of financial products are held by big
  banks with dated systems and painful processes.
  
  Join us if you want to
  
  - Take ownership across a broad remit. You are trusted to make
    decisions that drive a material impact on the direction
    and success of Lendable from day 1
  - Work in small teams of exceptional people, who are
    relentlessly resourceful to solve problems and find
    smarter solutions than the status quo
  - Build the best technology in-house, using new data sources,
    machine learning and AI to make machines do the heavy
    lifting
  
  About the role
  
  We're looking for a hands-on AI Engineer to join our
  Internal Automation team at Lendable and help us make the
  whole company more efficient.
  
  Our mission is to supercharge internal teams — from Finance
  and Compliance to Product, QA and beyond — by building AI-
  powered tools, integrations and automated workflows. You'll
  be part of a small team (4 engineers, 1 PM) with a simple
  goal: remove friction, automate the tedious, and give
  colleagues back time to focus on high-value work.
  
  This is a role where you'll see the direct impact of what
  you build. You'll ship an integration and watch it save
  hours of manual work. You'll build a tool and see a team
  adopt it the same week. If you're motivated by solving real
  problems and seeing your work make a tangible difference,
  this is for you.
  
  We need someone who takes full ownership — not just writing
  code, but thinking through the problem, designing the
  solution, shipping it, and making sure it keeps working.
  You'll own your work from "what should we build?" through to
  "is it still delivering value?".
  
  You'll also be working at the frontier of AI tooling —
  building with LLMs, experimenting with new approaches, and
  figuring out what's possible.
  
  What you'll be doing
  
  Build AI integrations and data sources
  
  - Create connectors and integrations that make company data
    available to AI systems (Google Workspace, Slack, Jira,
    GitHub, Snowflake, Confluence and more)
  - Build and maintain knowledge base pipelines, MCP
    integrations and API connections that power AI tooling
    across the business
  - Work with security and data governance requirements to
    ensure integrations are safe and appropriate
  
  Enable others to build with AI
  
  - Support internal teams to create their own AI-powered data
    sources, automated workflows and internal tools using
    rapid app builder tools
  - Build templates, guardrails and building blocks that make it
    easy for non-engineers to experiment safely
  - Contribute to our internal automation platform using tools
    like AWS Bedrock, n8n and custom-built solutions
  
  Deliver measurable impact
  
  - Work closely with the PM and engineering lead to identify
    the highest-leverage opportunities
  - Ship quickly, measure outcomes (time saved, errors reduced,
    adoption) and iterate based on what you learn
  - Stay curious about emerging tools and techniques — and apply
    them where they'll genuinely move the needle
  
  What we're looking for
  
  Essential
  
  - 4+ years of software engineering experience
  - Strong full-stack skills in Python or TypeScript
  - Experience shipping containerised software to Kubernetes
  - Proven experience building AI tooling used by others in a
    commercial environment
  - Comfortable working with LLMs, embeddings and AI application
    patterns
  - Experience designing and building API integrations
  - Self-starter who takes ownership end-to-end — from
    understanding the problem, through design and
    implementation, to monitoring and iteration
  - Motivated by impact — you want to see your work used and
    making a difference
  
  Nice to have
  
  - Experience with workflow automation tools (n8n, Zapier, Make
    or similar)
  - Familiarity with vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate,
    pgvector)
  - Experience with AWS Bedrock or other LLM provider APIs
  - Knowledge of MCP (Model Context Protocol)
  - Frontend skills with Next.js or React for internal tooling
  
  How you'll work
  
  You'll join a small, focused team where you'll have real
  ownership over what you build. Work comes as problem
  statements with clear direction from the engineering lead
  and PM — you'll figure out the "how", design the approach,
  build it, and make sure it keeps delivering value.
  
  We value shipping and learning over perfection. The goal is
  always to deliver something useful, learn from how it's
  used, and improve. You won't be directly client-facing, but
  your work will directly impact colleagues across the
  business — and you'll hear about it when something you built
  makes their day easier.
  
  Why join?
  
  See your work make a difference This isn't a team where your
  code disappears into a monolith. You'll build something on
  Monday and see it saving someone time by Friday. Every
  integration and tool you ship has a direct line to company
  efficiency.
  
  High leverage A small team means your contributions have
  outsized impact. No layers, fast decisions, real ownership.
  
  Build new things We're building a platform from the ground
  up, not maintaining legacy systems. You'll shape how AI gets
  used across Lendable.
  
  Work at the frontier AI tooling is moving fast. You'll work
  with the latest in agentic AI, workflow orchestration and
  LLM tooling — applied to real problems, not just proof-of-
  concepts.

    health insurance

    Lendable the most inclusive and open workspace in London
