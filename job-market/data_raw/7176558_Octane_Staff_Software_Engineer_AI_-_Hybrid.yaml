  At Octane, we’re building innovative technology solutions
  that power smarter, faster, and more efficient decision-
  making. We are seeking an accomplished AI/ML Technical Lead
  to drive the design, development, and deployment of advanced
  machine learning solutions that scale seamlessly in
  production environments. In this role, you’ll shape the
  strategy for how AI is leveraged across the organization,
  partnering with cross-functional teams to translate business
  goals into technical solutions that are not only state-of-
  the-art, but also ethical, secure, and reliable.
  
  This position is ideal for a hands-on leader who thrives at
  the intersection of research and engineering. You will
  mentor engineers and data scientists, establish best
  practices for MLOps, and ensure models deliver consistent
  value long after deployment. With opportunities to explore
  cutting-edge fields like generative AI, large language
  models, natural language processing, and computer vision,
  you’ll play a pivotal role in setting the technical standard
  for Octane’s AI initiatives while guiding the team toward
  innovation and measurable impact.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Lead the end-to-end design, development, and deployment of
    advanced AI/ML systems, ensuring production environments

  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define AI
    strategy, evaluate use cases, and translate business
    objectives into actionable technical solutions.
  - Build, optimize, and maintain machine learning pipelines,
    covering data ingestion, preprocessing, model training,
    evaluation, deployment, and ongoing monitoring.
  - Establish and champion MLOps best practices, including CI/CD
    for ML workflows, automated testing frameworks, and
    continuous model performance monitoring to prevent drift.
  - Serve as a technical mentor and leader, guiding engineers
    and data scientists on system architecture, coding
    standards, and efficient development practices.
  - Research and evaluate emerging AI methodologies, frameworks,
    and tools, integrating innovative approaches into the
    organization’s technology stack where applicable.
  - Ensure AI solutions meet ethical, security, and compliance
    standards, including model explainability, bias
    mitigation, and data privacy requirements.
  - Partner with engineering leadership to set technical
    strategy, establish architectural guidelines, and define
    standards that shape the future of AI initiatives at
    Octane.
  
  Requirements:
  
  - Master’s degree in Computer Science, Artificial
    Intelligence, Machine Learning, or related field with 5+

  - Proven expertise with leading ML/DL frameworks such as
    TensorFlow, PyTorch, or JAX, with hands-on experience
    training and deploying models.
  - Strong programming proficiency in Python, with additional
    experience using languages such as C++ or Java for
    performance-critical applications.
  - Practical experience with MLOps tools and workflows,
    including MLflow, Kubeflow, SageMaker, or Vertex AI to
    streamline model lifecycle management.
  - Deep understanding of data engineering concepts such as data
    pipelines, preprocessing, and distributed computing, as
    well as hands-on experience with cloud platforms (AWS,
    Azure, or GCP).
  - Demonstrated success designing, deploying, and optimizing
    AI/ML systems at scale, including model serving,
    monitoring, and iteration.
  - Strong communication and collaboration skills, with the
    ability to influence technical direction and align diverse
    stakeholders.
  
  Preferred Skills:
  
  - Experience with generative AI and large language models
    (LLMs), including prompt engineering and fine-tuning
    approaches.
  - Knowledge of advanced ML domains such as natural language
    processing (NLP), computer vision, reinforcement learning,
    or recommendation systems.
  - Familiarity with containerization and orchestration
    technologies, including Docker and Kubernetes, to support
    scalable deployment.
  - Hands-on experience with infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools,
    such as Terraform or Ansible, to enable automated and
