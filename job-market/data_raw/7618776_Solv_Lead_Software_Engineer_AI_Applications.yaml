  Being sick or injured is painful. Getting better shouldn’t
  be.
  
  Most industries have been transformed by new technology.
  Healthcare is still waiting — and you can help change that.
  
  Our mission is simple but ambitious: make healthcare
  accessible, transparent, and effortless for all. We put the
  consumer at the center, move fast and partner with forward-
  thinking providers to deliver software that makes care
  better, faster, and more human. This is work with real-world
  stakes — and you can help lead the way.
  
  As a key member of our engineering team, you’ll design and
  build systems that directly impact people’s lives. You’ll
  tackle complex, high-scale challenges in an industry that
  desperately needs innovation, using technology to reimagine
  the patient experience from the ground up.
  
  Solv Health is seeking an experienced engineering leader to
  architect and build the core infrastructure powering our
  suite of AI/LLM applications. You will help define best
  practices around model evaluation, monitoring, testing, and
  deployment, ensuring our AI services run reliably at scale
  and deliver measurable value to patients and providers.
  
  If you’re passionate about building the AI foundations that
  can transform healthcare, we’d love to hear from you!
  
  What You’ll Be Doing
  
  - Build and launch new, AI-native products that are
    transforming Solv’s core platform - powering intelligent
    workflows, automation, and personalized experiences for
    both patients and providers
  - Build systems for rigorous evaluation of model quality:
    establish metrics, automated test suites, and benchmarks
    for prompt performance
  - Develop observability & monitoring frameworks for production
    models, integrating logging, alerting, drift detection,
    and performance dashboards
  - Champion best practices in versioning, CI/CD, and artifact
    management for AI assets, partnering closely with
    security, compliance, and devops teams
  - Collaborate closely with product managers and client-facing
    teams to align AI features with user needs
  
  What You Bring
  
  - 6+ years of software engineering experience, with a minimum
    of 2 years building production AI/LLM applications
  - Deep understanding of AI/ML concepts, including foundation
    models, embeddings, vector search, prompt engineering, and
    RAG architectures, paired with solid computer science
    fundamentals
  - Proven track record defining and rolling out evaluation/test
    frameworks and monitoring systems for large-scale machine
    learning or LLM services
  - Expertise in cloud-native infrastructure (AWS), container
    orchestration (Kubernetes), and CI/CD tooling (e.g.,
    GitHub Actions) complemented by strong web development
    skills in React/Typescript/Python.
  - Strong leadership & communication skills, with experience
    guiding technical strategy, driving alignment across
    stakeholders, and mentoring peers
  - Stay abreast of the latest advancements in AI (new model
    releases, tools, research) and evaluate their potential
    benefit to our platform. Help define our company’s AI
    strategy and roadmap by identifying new use cases and
    capabilities that keep our product at the cutting edge.
  - Problem-solving attitude with a proactive approach to
    learning new technologies and innovating solutions to
    difficult problems
  - Curiosity and a learner attitude
  
  Bonus Points
  
  - Experience in healthcare technology or enterprise SaaS
    product environments. Direct knowledge of clinical
    workflows, healthcare interoperability standards (FHIR,
    HL7), or prior work on healthcare AI products is a plus.
  
  Solv offers robust benefits including:
  
  - Medical, Dental, Vision Insurance
  - 401k
  - Paid Parental Leave
  - Monthly Wellness Reimbursement
  - Flexible Time Off
