  Summary
  
  Guidewire is seeking a highly technical AI Workflow

  architect and implement AI-driven agents, automated coding
  assistants, and workflow orchestration tools that eliminate

  software is configured, integrated, and deployed, making our
  professional services teams faster, more accurate, and more
  efficient.

  - Internal Tooling & Orchestration: Build and maintain custom
    internal tools and LLM-based applications using frameworks
    like LangGraph, or LangChain to assist consultants in
    their daily delivery work
  - AI-Enhanced DevEx: Collaborate directly with Professional
    Services developers to understand their pain points and
    iterate on AI solutions that improve their "Developer
    Experience" (DevEx)
  - Prompt Engineering & RAG for Delivery: Develop and optimize
    RAG & GraphRag pipelines that tap into Guidewire’s
    internal documentation, best practices, and codebase to
    provide developers with instant, context-aware assistance.
  - Standardization & Governance: Create reusable AI modules and
    prompt libraries that can be shared across global delivery
    teams to ensure consistent implementation quality
  - Technical Mentorship: Act as an internal subject matter
    expert, training and guiding Professional Services
    developers on how to effectively use AI tools and
    integrate them into their local development environments
  - At Guidewire, we foster a culture of curiosity, innovation,
    and responsible use of AI—empowering our teams to
    continuously leverage emerging technologies and data-
    driven insights to enhance productivity and outcomes.

  - Experience with coding assistants (Claude Code)
  - Demonstrated ability to embrace AI and apply it to your
    current role as well as data-driven insights to drive
    innovation, productivity, and continuous improvement.

  - Proven track record of building robust, maintainable
    software and internal tools. Familiarity with CI/CD, Git
