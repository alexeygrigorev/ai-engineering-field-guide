description: |
  At Carrum, we are transforming how we pay for, deliver and
  experience healthcare. If you are passionate about changing
  healthcare and want to finally get rid of surprise bills,
  poor quality, and high prices, while thriving in an
  entrepreneurial, cutting-edge environment, we would love to
  connect with you.
  
  In 2014 Carrum reinvented the Centers of Excellence (COE)
  category in digital health. Today, 95% of the US population
  lives within 50 miles of a Carrum COE and our providers rank
  in the top 10% nationally. Our team’s execution has been
  recognized by the venture community and we’ve raised more
  than $96M in aggregate from investors like OMERS, Tiger
  Global Management and Wildcat Ventures. Our impact has been
  externally proven in a 2021 RAND Corporation study and
  featured as a Harvard Business School (HBS) case study.
  
  As a Staff Applied AI Product Engineer, you will bridge the
  gap between cutting-edge AI capabilities and real-world
  patient needs. You will take a hands-on leadership role in
  architecting and integrating LLM-driven features into our
  core platform. While our foundation is built on Ruby on
  Rails (SOA) and React, you will lead the evolution of our
  stack to support AI-native workflows and build agents to
  support key business initiatives such as improving care
  navigation quality and efficiency.
  
  You will work closely with Data and Product teams (including
  a dedicated Applied AI PM) to determine use cases that
  require LLMs rather than ML, build robust RAG (Retrieval-
  Augmented Generation) pipelines, select appropriate
  foundation models, iterate on prompts, and design the "glue"
  that turns raw model intelligence into reliable product
  features. You will partner with our DevOps team to leverage
  AWS/Azure for simple and cost-effective cloud infrastructure
  deployment, ensuring that systems are both performant and
  resilient. A key responsibility will be implementing
  comprehensive monitoring and observability practices to
  guarantee the high availability, security, and scalability
  of our new AI services. Additionally, you will collaborate
  directly with our internal clinical experts to validate
  model outputs, ensuring your AI agents are safe, accurate,
  and truly helpful in a healthcare setting.
  
  As a senior technical leader, you will own the AI
  engineering strategy, moving us beyond "demos" into
  scalable, production-ready systems. You will establish
  patterns for building “smart products,” model evaluation,
  latency optimization, and cost management, while ensuring we
  maintain strict data privacy and HIPAA compliance. You will
  champion Responsible AI by operationalizing the internal
  guidelines set by our AI Council, ensuring that fairness
  checks, bias detection, and safety guardrails are strictly
  implemented to serve all patient demographics equitably. You
  will mentor the wider engineering team on AI-native
  development practices (such as prompt engineering and
  context management) and collaborate with product managers to
  identify high-leverage opportunities where AI can radically
  simplify the healthcare experience. You will partner with
  the VP of Engineering and Chief Product Officer to staff and
  align delivery teams on your initiatives, while working with
  product teams to define project timelines and milestones
  from inception to go-live.
  
  This is a full time position, the salary range for this role
  is $190,000 - $260,000 depending on level of experience and
  geographic location.
  
  You’re excited about this opportunity because you will...
  
  - Define the Gen AI technical roadmap: You will build the
    foundation of Applied AI function at Carrum and have a
    direct impact on how Carrum leverages Generative AI to
    automate complex healthcare coordination and improve
    patient outcomes.
  - Build "magic" features: Move fast to prototype, iterate and
    ship AI-powered experiences that feel magical to users,
    such as instant answer bots or automated appointment
    logistics.
  - Architect for the future: Be the sole  expert on integrating
    vector databases, orchestration frameworks (like
    LangChain), and LLM APIs into a mature Service-Oriented
    Architecture.
  - Bridge the gap: Act as the translator between the
    "stochastic" world of AI models and the "deterministic"
    world of software engineering, ensuring reliability and
    trust.
  - Lead without ego: Mentor talented full-stack engineers on
    how to incorporate AI tools into their workflows, lifting
    the technical ceiling of the entire team.
  - Own the outcome: Take ownership of the full lifecycle of AI
    features—from prompt iteration and evaluation to
    production monitoring and user feedback loops.
  - Solve meaningful problems: Relish working with a diverse
    cross-functional group to solve actual pain points for
    patients, rather than just building tech for tech’s sake.
  - Prioritize quality: Hold yourself and others accountable to
    spending that extra 10% on a project to deliver great
    documentation in addition to the functionality itself.
  
  We’re excited about you because…
  
  - You have strong engineering roots: You have 10+ years of
    software development experience and have been the most
    senior engineer on a team. You know how to build robust,
    scalable, high availability systems, not just Jupyter
    notebooks.
  - You are an expert AI practitioner: You have 2+ years of
    dedicated professional experience architecting production-
    grade applications with LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Llama).
    You haven't just built demos; you have gone deep into the
    complexities of RAG pipelines and vector databases (e.g.,
    pgvector, Pinecone), solving for latency, hallucination,
    and retrieval accuracy at scale in customer facing
    products.
  - You go beyond AI/API basics: You know when to leverage
    prebuilt solutions versus custom LLM integrations and can
    apply fine-tuning and model optimization techniques when
    needed
  - You know the stack (or can learn it fast): You have
    experience working in a web application environment (Ruby
    on Rails, Python), have designed systems and know how to
    expose AI logic via performant APIs to frontend clients
    (React).
  - You include infrastructure in your designs: You are
    comfortable working with DevOps to design and configure
    Terraform for AI infrastructure, ensuring your services
    are deployable, reproducible, and scalable.
  - You act as a Tech Lead: You don't just write code; you drive
    execution and elevate the team. You enjoy technical
    leadership through code reviews, architectural design docs
    (RFCs), and teaching others, while also project managing
    cross-functional initiatives—breaking down ambiguous
    requirements, managing dependencies, and coordinating
    across teams to deliver on time.
  - You are AI-native: You use AI developer productivity tools
    (e.g., Cursor, GitHub Copilot) daily to accelerate your
    workflow and mentor the team on effective AI-assisted
    development.
  - You care about "The Last Mile": You understand that a model
    is only as good as the product wrapping it. You care about
    latency, error handling, monitoring/alerting and the user
    experience when the model hallucinates.
  - You are data-pragmatic: You are comfortable with SQL and
    data modeling, understanding that good AI requires good
    data infrastructure.
  - You are entrepreneurial: As a member of a startup, you excel
    at going from 0 to 1, finding creative ways to use AI to
    launch new products quickly and make a big impact with
    limited resources.
  - You manage complexity well: You have experience handling
    deadlines, keeping many balls in the air, and prioritizing
    work in a fast-paced, dynamic environment.
  - You value distinct human skills: You have interpersonal
    skills and don't have a hard time being empathetic,
    courteous, and friendly.
