  Company Description
  
  Assent is the leading solution for supply chain
  sustainability tailored for the world’s top-tier,
  sustainability-driven manufacturers. Hidden risks riddle
  supply chains, many of which weren't built with
  sustainability in mind. That's where we step in. With
  insights from experts, Assent is the tool manufacturers
  trust for comprehensive sustainability.
  
  We are proud to announce that Assent has crossed the US$100M
  ARR milestone, granting us Centaur Status. This

  makes us the first and only Certified B Corporation in North
  America's SaaS sustainability industry to celebrate this
  milestone.
  
  Our journey from $5 million to US$100M ARR in just eight
  years has been marked by significant growth and
  achievements. With our $350 million US funding led by Vista

  are on the lookout for outstanding team members to join our
  mission.
