  Job Description
  
  We are seeking an experienced AI Manager with deep expertise
  in Azure AI, Microsoft Fabric, and Machine Learning
  ecosystems to design and implement enterprise-grade AI
  solutions. The ideal candidate combines strong technical
  leadership with hands-on experience architecting end-to-end
  AI/ML systems—from data readiness through model
  deployment—leveraging Azure’s cloud-native and Fabric-based
  services.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Architect and lead the design and implementation of AI/ML
    solutions on Azure Cloud (Azure Machine Learning, Azure
    Databricks, Synapse, Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft Fabric,
    Cognitive Services, Azure OpenAI etc.).
  - Define end-to-end AI architecture encompassing data
    pipelines, feature stores, model training, deployment, and
    monitoring.
  - Partner with stakeholders to translate business challenges
    into AI-driven solutions and technical blueprints.
  - Design scalable and secure architectures adhering to best
    practices in data governance, MLOps, LLMOps, and cost
    optimization.
  - Integrate Microsoft Fabric as the unified data foundation
    for AI workloads, ensuring governed, high-quality data
    access and lineage visibility.
  - Lead MLOps initiatives including model CI/CD, versioning,
    monitoring, and drift detection using Azure DevOps, Azure
    ML Pipelines, and Azure AI Foundry.
  - Contribute to the design, building, or working with event-
    driven architectures and relevant for asynchronous
    processing and system integration
  - Experience developing and deploying LLM-powered features
    into production systems, translating experimental outputs
    into robust services with clear APIs.
  - Experience working within a standard software development
    lifecycle
  - Evaluate and implement Generative AI (GenAI) and LLM-based
    solutions using Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Services, and
    frameworks such as LangChain or LangGraph.
  - Establish observability and monitoring frameworks using
    Azure Monitor, Application Insights, MLflow, and
    Databricks dashboards for AI workloads.
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams—Data Engineers, Data
    Scientists, Software Engineers  and DevOps to ensure
    seamless integration and delivery of AI products.
  - Provide technical mentorship and architectural guidance to
    engineering teams.
  
  Qualifications
  
  - 5 + years of overall IT experience, including 4+ years in
    AI/ML solutioning and 3 + years in Azure-based
    architecture.
  - Deep expertise in the Azure AI ecosystem—Azure Machine
    Learning, Azure Databricks, Azure AI Foundry, Microsoft
    Fabric, Azure Cognitive Services, Azure OpenAI, Azure
    Synapse, and Data Lake.
  - Strong proficiency in Python and major ML frameworks
    (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn).
  - Proven experience with transformer model architectures and
    practical understanding of LLM specifics like context
    handling.
  - Proven experience designing, implementing, and optimising
    prompt strategies (e.g., chaining, templates, dynamic
    inputs); practical understanding of output post-
    processing.
  - Must have hands-on experience implementing and automating
    MLOps/LLMOps practices, including model tracking,
    versioning, deployment, monitoring (latency, cost,
    throughput, reliability), logging, and retraining
    workflows.
  - Must have worked extensively with MLOps/experiment tracking
    and operational tools (e.g., MLflow, Weights & Biases) and
    have a demonstrable track record.
  - Proven ability to monitor, evaluate, and optimise AI/LLM
    solutions for performance (latency, throughput,
    reliability), accuracy, and cost in production
    environments.
  - Proven experience in MLOps and LLMOps design and automation
    using Azure DevOps, Docker, and Kubernetes.
  - Hands-on experience integrating AI solutions with Microsoft
    Fabric and Azure Data Factory for data preparation and
    governance.
  - Strong understanding of distributed systems, model lifecycle
    management, and AI system scalability.
  - Experience in LLM fine-tuning, prompt engineering, or AI
    solution integration with enterprise applications.
  - Excellent communication and stakeholder management skills
    with a strategic mindset.
