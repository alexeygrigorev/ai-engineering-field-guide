  About WeBuild-AI:
  
  WeBuild-AI are AI natives delivering 10x value for
  enterprise organisations. We combine highly skilled experts
  with our AI Launchpad, industry-aligned language models, and
  agents to transform enterprise organisations into AI-powered
  and data-driven businesses. We work with enterprise
  organisations on a global stage, reinventing how they
  design, build, and operate AI powered software at scale with
  speed.
  
  Our Purpose:
  
  We're on a mission to reinvent what's possible with AI in
  enterprise environments. Our AI Engineers don't just
  implement solutions—they discover new patterns of working
  with AI that revolutionise entire business processes. We
  believe AI will fundamentally transform how organisations
  operate, and we're looking for pioneers who want to lead
  this transformation, working at the absolute cutting edge of
  what's possible with today's most advanced AI technologies.
  
  Role Overview:
  
  As a Principal AI Engineer at WeBuild-AI, you will design,
  develop, and deploy innovative AI solutions that transform
  our clients' businesses. You'll leverage cutting-edge
  language models, agent frameworks, and our Pathway platform
  to create high-impact AI applications that deliver 10x
  value. You'll be given the freedom to experiment and push
  boundaries, discovering new ways AI can solve complex
  enterprise challenges.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Define the overall AI architecture and technology strategy,
    ensuring long-term scalability and reliability.
  - Lead technical direction across multiple teams, overseeing
    the full AI solution lifecycle — from concept to
    production.
  - Mentor and guide Lead AI Engineers and technical
    contributors to raise the engineering bar.
  - Champion best practices for governance, observability, and
    lifecycle management of AI systems.
  - Evaluate and introduce emerging frameworks, including
    Autogen, LangGraph, and other agentic ecosystems.
  - Partner with senior stakeholders to align AI strategy with
    business goals.
  - Drive the evolution of our internal platform (Pathway) to
    enable faster, safer AI delivery.
  - Represent the company externally as a technical authority —
    at client workshops, conferences, or thought leadership
    sessions.
  - Proactively identify and mitigate risks in AI adoption,
    ensuring ethical and compliant implementation.
  
  Required Skills & Experience
  
  - Deep experience architecting and scaling enterprise-grade
    AI/ML systems.
  - Proven expertise with cloud AI ecosystems (AWS Bedrock,
    SageMaker, Azure OpenAI, Azure ML).
  - Strong command of agent frameworks, vector databases, and
    LLM orchestration tools.
  - Ability to lead multi-disciplinary teams and manage complex
    AI projects.
  - Advanced proficiency in Python, MLOps, and software
    engineering principles.
  - Experience setting technical standards, governance
    frameworks, and performance benchmarks.
  - Strong consulting mindset with the ability to translate
    emerging technology into business impact.
  - Strategic thinker with the ability to pioneer new approaches
    and challenge conventional wisdom.
  
  The Mindset We Value:
  
  Relentless Innovation: We're looking for individuals who are
  constantly exploring the edges of what's possible with AI.
  You should be the type who stays up late testing new
  approaches just to see what might work.
  
  Flexible Methodology: Traditional development approaches
  don't always apply to AI. We need people who can adapt their
  working methods to the unique characteristics of AI systems,
  embracing experimental approaches when appropriate.
  
  "Can Do" Attitude:  When faced with a seemingly impossible
  challenge, your response should be "let's figure out how"
  rather than "it can't be done." We value determined problem-
  solvers who find a way forward.
  
  Balanced Perspective:  While pushing boundaries, you must
  maintain a grounded understanding of enterprise realities,
  balancing innovation with practical implementation.
  
  Growth Opportunities:
  
  - Develop expertise with emerging AI models and capabilities
    before they reach mainstream adoption.
  - Create intellectual property and novel implementation
    approaches.
  - Work across multiple industries to develop deep domain
    expertise.
  - Contribute to the evolution of our proprietary AI
    methodology.
  - Participate in the AI research community and establish
    thought leadership.
  - Shape new AI services and capabilities within our Pathway
    platform.
