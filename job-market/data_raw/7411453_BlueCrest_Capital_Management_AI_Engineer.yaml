  Job Title: AI Engineer
  
  Division: Front Office Technology
  
  Reports To: Quantitative Developer AI
  
  Location: London
  
  Department Overview:
  
  We are part of the Front Office Technology team responsible
  for delivering advanced AI and machine learning solutions
  that enable the business through LLM-powered applications,
  including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems,
  agentic process automation, and scalable internal AI tools.
  The team collaborates closely with Quant Research, Data
  Technology, and Rapid Application Development, forming the
  central AI capability that supports both research and
  operational efficiency across the firm.
  
  Role Overview:
  
  As BlueCrest continues to integrate AI across its front-
  office and research workflows, we are seeking a Junior AI
  Engineer to join our central FO Tech Team. This position
  sits at the intersection of technology and innovation,
  contributing directly to how AI is applied to enhance
  trading, research, and operational efficiency across the
  firm.
  
  This role offers a rare opportunity to work hands-on with
  cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) and emerging AI
  architectures while helping to shape the foundations of
  enterprise-scale AI adoption. You’ll design and implement
  frameworks that make advanced AI capabilities widely
  accessible across teams — enabling improved knowledge
  retrieval, intelligent process automation, and enhanced
  decision support.
  
  You’ll collaborate closely with Front Office Technology,
  Quant Research, and business teams to develop robust AI
  systems that align with the firm’s strategic innovation
  goals. The successful candidate will play a key role in
  building, deploying, and maintaining scalable AI
  infrastructure — ensuring that the firm can securely
  leverage generative and analytical AI to support
  quantitative researchers, analysts, and operational users.
  
  In this role, you’ll gain exposure to real-world financial
  applications of AI, contribute to the firm’s software
  development lifecycle, and help shape the tools and
  standards that underpin responsible, high-performance AI
  engineering at BlueCrest.
  
  Experience Required:
  
  Essential:
  
  - Degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or related
    technical field, or equivalent industry experience.
  - Proficiency in Python and experience with frameworks such as
    OpenAI Agents SDK, LangChain, LlamaIndex, or Hugging Face
    Transformers.
  - Understanding of RAG and LLM orchestration techniques.
  - Experience working with APIs, vector databases (e.g.,
    Qdrant, Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate), and embedding models.
  - Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS, Azure) and
    containerized environments.
  - Strong grasp of software engineering fundamentals — version
    control, modular design, testing, and documentation.
  - Exposure to agentic AI systems or multi-agent orchestration
    frameworks.
  - Experience building internal tools, SDKs, or developer
    platforms.
  - Experience with MLOps, CI/CD for models, and monitoring
    pipelines.
  
  Desirable:
  
  - Previous experience working in financial markets or
    investment firms.
  - Interest in financial technology or data-rich enterprise
    environments.
  
  About You:
  
  In this role you must be self-motivated and able to learn
  quickly. This is a highly technical role, you need to be a
  curious and motivated technologist with a strong interest in
  how AI can transform workflows across complex organisations.
  You thrive in collaborative, fast-moving environments and
  are eager to learn. You are comfortable with hands-on
  engineering, take initiative in problem-solving, and enjoy
  the challenge of scaling new technologies responsibly.
  
  BlueCrest is committed to providing an inclusive environment
  for its workforce. As an employer, we provide equal
  opportunities to all people regardless of their gender,
  marital or civil partnership status, race, religion or
  ethnicity, disability, age, sexual orientation or
  nationality.
