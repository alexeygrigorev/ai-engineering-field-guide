  Job Summary
  
  OpenGov is seeking a highly technical AI Platform &
  Orchestration Engineer to build and scale our Snowflake-
  native AI execution layer. You will be among the first
  members of our Pune AI engineering team, with significant
  ownership and influence over how we build and scale AI
  systems globally.
  
  This role is responsible for transforming AI use cases into
  durable, production-ready systems using Snowflake AI
  features, agent orchestration platforms, and modern LLM
  frameworks.
  
  You will work at the intersection of data, process
  orchestration, and applied AI. This is not a research role.
  It is a hands-on engineering role focused on building
  reliable pipelines, agent workflows, retrieval systems, and
  context-engineer frameworks that power intelligent
  automation across GTM, G&A, and internal enterprise
  operations.
  
  You will partner closely with a global team to
  operationalize AI workflows that are scalable, observable,
  and governed. This role requires strong Snowflake expertise,
  comfort with Python, SQL, and working with DBT data models,
  as well as experience building orchestrated AI systems that
  can scale across an enterprise.
  
  Core Responsibilities
  
  - Design and implement Snowflake-native AI pipelines to
    support enterprise automation and intelligent workflows.
  - Build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,
    embedding pipelines, and vector-based retrieval
    architectures.
  - Configure and manage AI orchestration workflows using Airia
    or similar agent frameworks.
  - Develop scalable context-routing and orchestration logic to
    support multi-step agentic workflows.
  - Partner with Data Engineering and Enterprise Systems teams
    to integrate both structured and unstructured enterprise
    data into AI systems in a cost effective and performant
    manner.
  - Implement monitoring, evaluation, and feedback mechanisms to
    track agent reliability and adoption, as well as
    continuously learn from accuracy logs.
  - Optimize Snowflake AI feature usage for performance, cost-
    efficiency, and scalability.
  - Support development of prompt libraries, context schemas,
    and reusable AI workflow components.
  - Collaborate on architectural standards for Model Context
    Protocol (MCP), agent governance, and data security.
  - Continuously evaluate emerging AI frameworks and tooling to
    enhance OpenGov’s AI platform capabilities.
  
  Required Experience
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a
    related field.
  - 5–8 years of experience in software engineering, data
    engineering, applied AI engineering, platform engineering,
    or related roles.
  - Strong hands-on experience with Snowflake, including AI
    functions, semantic modeling, and Cortex.
  - Experience building or supporting Retrieval-Augmented
    Generation (RAG) pipelines.
  - Experience working with Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM
    APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.).
  - Hands-on experience with orchestration frameworks (Airia,
    LangChain, CrewAI, or similar).
  - Strong proficiency in SQL/Python and comfort working
    directly with enterprise data warehouses.
  - Experience building API integrations and managing structured
    and unstructured data pipelines.
  - Understanding of agent lifecycle management, reliability,
    and evaluation best practices.
  - Ability to independently own and deliver end-to-end AI
    workflow implementations.
  - Strong problem-solving skills with a bias toward scalable
    system design.
  
  Nice to Have:
  
  - Surfacing AI systems via lightweight web applications
    (React, Streamlit, FastAPI, Flask, Node.js, etc.).
  - Experience implementing enterprise AI systems in SaaS
    environments.
  - Exposure to event-driven architectures and workflow engines.
  - Experience with vector databases and embedding models.
  - Understanding of CI/CD in data engineering contexts.
  - Experience working in compliance-heavy or public sector
    environments.
  - Experience collaborating with cross-functional, non-
    technical stakeholders.
