  About General Intuition
  
  The most powerful foundation models are trained on written
  words. But human intelligence far exceeds language. Truly
  intelligent machines must move from words to worlds, and
  acquire the capacity to perceive, anticipate, and improvise.
  They need to obtain a general intuition of reality.
  
  We embrace games as the ultimate expression of ingenuity and
  problem solving. General Intuition builds on the strength of
  Medal, the world’s largest and fastest-growing platform for
  gaming moments. Every year, our players capture billions of
  gameplay clips, each representing a unique, action-packed
  highlight. Across countless environments, this diversity
  leads to uniquely capable agentic systems.
  
  For the past year, we’ve been pushing the frontier across:
  
  - Agents capable of deep spatial and temporal reasoning
  - World models that provide training environments for those
    agents, and
  - Video understanding with a focus on transfer beyond games
  
  What we're looking for:
  
  - Depth of XP: 4+ years of video machine-learning, with a
    focus on image embedding and computer vision. Bonus for
    applicants who have XP in generative AI, familiarity with
    high throughput video inference/feature extraction
  - In-person: Looking to hire in NYC to contribute alongside
    the product team. 3+ days in the office
  - Ownership & attention to detail: You see things through, and
    can be responsible for end-to-end quality of complex
    features.
  - Code Performance: Excellent understanding of code
    performance and performance implications in production
  - Be result-driven: Everything we do is driven by the metrics
    and performance of the feature. We move fast and ship
    regularly
  - Measuring with metrics: Comfort with A/B testing and
    measuring results with usage metrics
  - Gaming: A passion for games and the gaming communities, and
    a user of Discord and other gaming-adjacent products. XP
    working on gaming-related projects is a plus
  
  Our stack:
  
  - ML technologies: GCP, Bigquery, OpenCV, PyTorch, KubeFlow
    Pipelines, Airflow
  - Desktop Front-end: Electron, React, Redux, & other modern
    web-based technologies
  - Recorder: C# and C++
  - Mobile: Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android
  - Backend: Java, Redis, RabbitMQ, Kubernetes, Docker
  - Infra: Terraform, Salt, GitHub Actions, CircleCI for IaC and
    CI/CD
