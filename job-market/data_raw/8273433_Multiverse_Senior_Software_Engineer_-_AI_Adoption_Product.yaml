  Multiverse is the upskilling platform for AI and Tech
  adoption.
  
  We have partnered with 1,500+ companies to deliver a new
  kind of learning that's transforming today’s workforce.
  
  Our upskilling apprenticeships are designed for people of
  any age and career stage to build critical AI, data, and
  tech skills. Our learners have driven $2bn+ ROI for their
  employers, using the skills they’ve learned to improve
  productivity and measurable performance.
  
  In June 2022, we announced a $220 million Series D funding
  round co-led by StepStone Group, Lightspeed Venture Partners
  and General Catalyst. With a post-money valuation of $1.7bn,
  the round makes us the UK’s first EdTech unicorn.
  
  But we aren’t stopping there. With a strong operational
  footprint and 800+ employees, we have ambitious plans to
  continue scaling. We’re building a world where tech skills
  unlock people’s potential and output.  Join Multiverse and
  power our mission to equip the workforce to win in the AI
  era.
  
  Having built a thriving upskilling apprenticeship business
  we are now doubling down on our AI strategy with the launch
  of a groundbreaking AI Adoption Platform. This new venture
  operates as a ‘startup’ within the business, leveraging
  Multiverse's established customer base, intellectual
  property, and experienced team. Our MVP has already
  demonstrated 7x adoption results in initial pilots by
  delivering personalized, role- and tool-specific AI use
  cases and upskilling at scale, enhanced by social features
  and measurable ROI. We are building a dedicated team to
  rapidly develop and scale this platform, and we're looking
  for pioneering individuals to drive its market success from
  the ground up.
  
  This is a rare opportunity to:
  
  - Develop a category-defining product with proven initial
    traction into a greenfield UK market
  - Solve a massive enterprise pain point that affects every
    major global company
  - Build something from scratch while leveraging proven
    playbooks and IP
  - Shape the future of work in the AI era.
  
  About the Role
  
  We are building a small foundational team of engineers to
  build and iterate on our new adoption platform. You’ll be
  working closely together with our AI Adoption Team to build
  new features from scratch, quickly iterating to improve them
  as we get customer feedback and continue to evolve our
  offer.
  
  This is a fast paced, scrappy and highly collaborative team,
  working to solve complex and compelling engineering
  challenges. We’ll provide you with the support, autonomy,
  and flexibility you need to do your best work. We believe in
  creating an environment where everyone can thrive and grow,
  supported by mentorship, learning opportunities, and a
  strong team culture.
