  and venture studios to recognizable retail brands and
  exciting enterprises. Some of our notable clients include
  Google, Shopify, Coinbase, Alchemy, Hinge, OVO, Polymarket,

  more!
  
  Join Lazer and help us solve problems and build the next
  generation of products!
  
  Lazer Core is a specialized team within Lazer focused on
  building robust, AI-powered full-stack applications. We
  partner closely with ambitious teams across industries to
  bring cutting-edge products to life, leveraging the latest
  in AI, agentic workflows, and scalable infrastructure. Our

  impact problems with tailored, production-ready solutions.
  
  Who You Are:

    with TypeScript, React, Node.js, Python or Go.
  - Experience with generative AI in areas like image or video
    generation.
  - Proven experience shipping production software across the
    stack.
  - Strong experience hosting, tuning, and managing LLM
    services, libraries, or tools.
  - Experience working with agentic workflows, including
    creating and using MCP servers.
  - A track record of building AI-powered features such as

    search, data normalization, etc.
  - Familiarity with prompt engineering and structured
    experimentation workflows.
  - Experience fine-tuning LLMs using open-source models or
    closed-source services.
  - Confidence in setting up testing infrastructure around
    agentic applications.
  - Comfort working with at least one major cloud provider (GCP,
    AWS, Azure), especially data tools like BigQuery,
    SageMaker, etc.
  - Previous experience in consulting or contracting roles, with
    the ability to manage client expectations and timelines.
  
  What You'll Do:
  
  - Engage with clients to understand their problems, needs,
    goals, and technical environments.
  - Architect, build, and ship full stack applications that
    leverage AI and data capabilities.
  - Apply best practices in MLOps or LLMOps, including testing,

  Why This Might Not Be For You
  
  - 🤖 You Resist Modern Tools: We leverage AI and cutting-edge
    technology to build rapidly and focus our energy on
    solving the most complex, high-impact challenges for our
    clients.
  - 🏗️ You Crave High Structure: We thrive in an autonomous,

    comfortable with some ambiguity.
  - 😴 You Prefer Conventional Careers: Our consulting approach
    involves varied projects and direct client interaction —
    it's not for everyone.
  - 1️⃣ You Like Staying in One Lane: Our projects require
    adapting to different tech stacks and modern tooling

  Benefits & Perks
  
  - 🌐 Work From Anywhere: Choose your workspace — all you need

    live…you know...life.
  - 🩺 Employee Care: We provide full benefits (healthcare,
    dental, vision) for our employees (401k for our US
    employees)
  - 🏖️ Unlimited PTO: Everyone needs a break. Take at least 15
    days off a year, and more if you need—just be cool about
    it and keep the team in mind.
  - 🎉 Regular Team Retreat: Join us for a week of team bonding
    at amazing destinations. Recent trips include the
    Dominican Republic, Cancun, and Hawaii — plus ones
    welcome.
