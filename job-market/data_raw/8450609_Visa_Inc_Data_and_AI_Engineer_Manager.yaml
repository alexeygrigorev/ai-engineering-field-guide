  Job Description
  
  We are seeking an experienced Manager - Data & AI Engineer
  to join our CEMEA team. This is a Staff-level individual
  contributor role for someone who thrives on solving complex
  technical challenges, architecting scalable data platforms,
  and driving engineering excellence. You'll lead critical
  data engineering initiatives, mentor talented engineers, and
  build the data infrastructure that powers insights and AI-
  driven solutions for Visa's global clients.
  
  What You'll Do:
  
  Data Platform Architecture & Development:
  
  - Design and build enterprise-scale data platforms using
    modern big data technologies including Spark, Hadoop,
    Kafka, and cloud-native services.
  - Architect robust, scalable data pipelines that process
    petabytes of data for batch, streaming, and real-time
    analytics
  - Drive technical decisions on architecture, tooling, and
    engineering practices that impact multiple projects and
    teams
  - Establish and enforce engineering standards, best practices,
    and code quality across data engineering initiatives
  
  Build Production-Grade Data Pipelines:
  
  - Develop and optimize large-scale ETL/ELT pipelines for data
    ingestion, transformation, quality assurance, and feature
    engineering
  - Implement streaming data pipelines using Kafka and Spark
    Streaming for real-time analytics and decision-making
  - Design data models, partitioning strategies, and
    optimization techniques for distributed systems
  - Ensure data quality, reliability, and observability across
    all data workflows
  
  Enable AI/ML & Advanced Analytics:
  
  - Build data infrastructure that supports AI/ML workloads
    including feature stores, training pipelines, and model
    serving infrastructure
  - Collaborate with data scientists to productionize machine
    learning models through robust MLOps practices
  - Design and implement data pipelines for GenAI applications
    including embeddings generation, vector storage, and
    retrieval systems
  - Support deployment of AI/ML models with scalable inference
    pipelines and monitoring
  
  Drive Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps Excellence:
  
  - Manage and optimize AWS/Azure cloud infrastructure (S3, EMR,
    EC2, Lambda, Glue, Redshift, SageMaker)
  - Build CI/CD pipelines and automate deployments using
    Jenkins, Git, Docker, and Kubernetes
  - Implement workflow orchestration using Airflow, Prefect, or
    Control-M
  - Design for high availability, disaster recovery, and system
    reliability
  
  Technical Leadership & Collaboration:
  
  - Mentor junior data engineers, fostering a culture of
    continuous learning and innovation
  - Code reviews and technical discussions to elevate team
    capabilities
  - Partner with product managers, data scientists, and business
    stakeholders to translate requirements into technical
    solutions
  - Stay current with emerging technologies and drive adoption
    of best practices in data engineering and AI/ML
    infrastructure
  
  This is a hybrid position. Expectation of days in office
  will be confirmed by your hiring manager.
