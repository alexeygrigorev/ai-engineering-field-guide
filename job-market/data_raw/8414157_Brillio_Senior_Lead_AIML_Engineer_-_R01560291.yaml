  - JD is below: The Agentic AI Lead is a pivotal role
    responsible for driving the research, development, and
    deployment of semi-autonomous AI agents to solve complex
    enterprise challenges. This role involves hands-on
    experience with LangGraph, leading initiatives to build
    multi-agent AI systems that operate with greater autonomy,
    adaptability, and decision-making capabilities. The ideal
    candidate will have deep expertise in LLM orchestration,
    knowledge graphs, reinforcement learning (RLHF/RLAIF), and
    real-world AI applications. As a leader in this space,
    they will be responsible for designing, scaling, and
    optimizing agentic AI workflows, ensuring alignment with
    business objectives while pushing the boundaries of next-
    gen AI automation.
    ________________________________________ Key
    Responsibilities 1. Architecting & Scaling Agentic AI
    Solutions • Design and develop multi-agent AI systems
    using LangGraph for workflow automation, complex decision-
    making, and autonomous problem-solving. • Build memory-
    augmented, context-aware AI agents capable of planning,
    reasoning, and executing tasks across multiple domains. •
    Define and implement scalable architectures for LLM-
    powered agents that seamlessly integrate with enterprise
    applications. 2. Hands-On Development & Optimization •
    Develop and optimize agent orchestration workflows using
    LangGraph, ensuring high performance, modularity, and
    scalability. • Implement knowledge graphs, vector
    databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS), and retrieval-
    augmented generation (RAG) techniques for enhanced agent
    reasoning. • Apply reinforcement learning (RLHF/RLAIF)
    methodologies to fine-tune AI agents for improved
    decision-making. 3. Driving AI Innovation & Research •
    Lead cutting-edge AI research in Agentic AI, LangGraph,
    LLM Orchestration, and Self-improving AI Agents. • Stay
    ahead of advancements in multi-agent systems, AI planning,
    and goal-directed behavior, applying best practices to
    enterprise AI solutions. • Prototype and experiment with
    self-learning AI agents, enabling autonomous adaptation
    based on real-time feedback loops. 4. AI Strategy &
    Business Impact • Translate Agentic AI capabilities into
    enterprise solutions, driving automation, operational
    efficiency, and cost savings. • Lead Agentic AI proof-of-
    concept (PoC) projects that demonstrate tangible business
    impact and scale successful prototypes into production. 5.
    Mentorship & Capability Building • Lead and mentor a team
    of AI Engineers and Data Scientists, fostering deep
    technical expertise in LangGraph and multi-agent
    architectures. • Establish best practices for model
    evaluation, responsible AI, and real-world deployment of
    autonomous AI agents.
