description: |
  Conversica is seeking a Staff AI Software Engineer to
  design, build, and scale production-grade AI systems that
  deliver direct customer and business value. This senior
  individual contributor role emphasizes pragmatic, product-
  focused, customer-driven thinking, with a focus on
  translating real-world problems into reliable, maintainable,
  and scalable AI-driven solutions.
  
  This role operates with a high degree of autonomy and
  technical influence, shaping AI and systems architecture,
  engineering standards, and best practices across the
  organization.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Design, implement, and ship AI-driven features and systems
    into production environments
  - Own technical decision-making for AI architecture, data
    modeling, and system integration
  - Partner closely with Product, Engineering, and other
    stakeholders to translate business needs into scalable
    technical solutions
  - Identify and address reliability, scalability, performance,
    and observability challenges in AI systems
  - Establish and evolve best practices for applied AI
    engineering, including agent evaluation, interpretability,
    and reliability, data layer design, monitoring,
    explainability, and continuous improvement
  - Mentor and guide other engineers, raising the bar on AI
    engineering quality and decision-making
  - Contribute to technical strategy and roadmap discussions
    related to AI capabilities and overall platform evolution
  
  What You’ll Build
  
  - Agentic system design: orchestration, tool use,
    state/memory, multi-step workflows
  - Evals + quality: harnesses, regression tests for
    prompts/agents, online/offline metrics, iteration loops
  - Guardrails: hallucination mitigation, grounding, HITL
    review, safe degradation paths
  - Production operations: cost/latency tradeoffs, caching,
    rate-limits, fallbacks, observability, incident response
  - Retrieval + data foundations: RAG choices, indexing,
    freshness, data quality constraints, data layer design
  
  Qualification & Experience
  
  - Equivalent of 8+ years of professional software engineering
    experience, with significant focus on applied AI.
  - Proven experience deploying LLM-powered systems/applications
    in production environments
  - Strong proficiency in Python, and experience building
    production LLM applications (agents/tool use, retrieval,
    evals, monitoring)
  - Experience working with large datasets and navigating real-
    world data quality challenges
  - Strong system design, problem-solving, and architectural
    decision-making skills
  - Experience designing agent architectures, tool interfaces,
    and orchestration patterns
  - Desire to continually follow and experiment with cutting
    edge AI technologies and tooling for use across all phases
    of the software development lifecycle (i.e. during design,
    analysis, coding, deployment, QA, etc.)
  - Strong background in modern cloud-based architectures.
  
  Preferred / Nice-to-Have Experience
  
  - Experience applying AI solutions in a B2B SaaS environment
  - Experience interacting with data from Marketing Automation
    Platforms (MAPs), Customer Resource Management Systems
    (CRMs), and Customer Data Platforms (CDPs)
  - Experience deploying AWS infrastructure, and production use
    of Terraform, EKS, Postgres, MySQL, Datadog, and GitLab
  
  What We Value
  
  - We care about what you’ve built, not where you learned it.
    If you’ve shipped strong software, led technical decisions
    under ambiguity, contributed to open source, written
    thoughtful technical work, or built impressive projects
    with modern LLM tooling - put that front and center. Show
    us what you've built, what problems you've wrestled with,
    and how you reason about tradeoffs in systems that combine
    LLMs with real-world constraints.
  
  Conversica is a remote-first company building AI-powered
  solutions that help businesses engage customers more
  effectively. You’ll work alongside thoughtful product and
  engineering partners, influence the direction of applied AI
  across the platform, and help turn emerging AI capabilities
  into durable, customer-ready systems.
  
  This is a full-time, exempt position. Our compensation
  reflects the cost of labor across several U.S. geographic
  markets and is based on role scope, experience, and job-
  related skills. Conversica offers comprehensive health,
  dental, and vision benefits, PTO, holiday pay, 401(k), and
  equity.
