  Our Approach to Flexible Work
  
  
  With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-
  person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to
  deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do
  their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in
  many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-
  office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our
  time each quarter in the office or in the field with our
  customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This
  means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule
  that caters to your business, team, and personal needs,
  while being intentional to make the most of time spent
  together. Those in our remote "home office" roles also have
  the opportunity to come together in our offices for
  important moments that matter.
  
  At Workday, we are committed to providing an accessible and
  inclusive hiring experience where all candidates can fully
  demonstrate their skills. If you require assistance or an
  accommodation at any point, please email
  accommodations@workday.com.
  
  Are you being referred to one of our roles? If so, ask your
  connection at Workday about our Employee Referral process!
  
  At Workday, we value our candidates’ privacy and data
  security.  Workday will never ask candidates to apply to
  jobs through websites that are not Workday Careers.
  
  
  
  Please be aware of sites that may ask for you to input your
  data in connection with a job posting that appears to be
  from Workday but is not.
  
  
  
  In addition, Workday will never ask candidates to pay a
  recruiting fee, or pay for consulting or coaching services,
  in order to apply for a job at Workday.
