  Position Overview
  
  
  Autodesk is undertaking a bold transformation to build an
  AI-first application platform that delivers a seamless,
  unified experience—fundamentally reshaping how users and
  internal teams operate within an agent-driven workspace.
  This platform will serve as the foundation for the next
  generation of design-and-make software.
  
  
  We are looking for a skilled Principal Software Engineer –
  Agentic AI to architect, build, and deploy advanced AI
  agents capable of autonomous reasoning, decision-making, and
  self-directed execution. The ideal candidate brings deep
  expertise in modern AI architectures, reinforcement
  learning, and multi-agent systems, along with a strong
  commitment to the responsible and ethical deployment of
  agentic AI. In this role, you will collaborate closely with
  cross-functional partners to develop domain-aware
  intelligent systems that accelerate innovation and deliver
  meaningful business impact across the Autodesk platform.
  
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Agentic AI Design & Development: Architect, develop, and
    optimize agentic AI systems, including autonomous agents,
    multi-agent frameworks, and LLM-powered agents. Integrate
    these solutions seamlessly into existing Autodesk
    platforms and workflows
  - Research & Experimentation: Assess emerging agentic AI
    models, frameworks, and tooling. Prototype, evaluate, and
    benchmark solutions to ensure scalability, robustness,
    safety, and performance
  - Deployment & Monitoring: Deploy agentic AI solutions into
    production environments with a focus on reliability and
    operational excellence. Monitor agent behavior, detect and
    diagnose anomalies, refine agent policies, and establish
    feedback loops for continuous learning and improvement
  - Ethics & Governance: Ensure all agentic AI systems adhere to
    ethical guidelines, regulatory requirements, and internal
    governance standards throughout their lifecycle
  - Cross-Functional Collaboration: Partner closely with
    architects, software engineers, product managers, and
    business stakeholders. Clearly communicate complex
    technical concepts and trade-offs to both technical and
    non-technical audiences
  
  Minimum Qualifications
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science,
    Engineering, or a related technical discipline
  - 10+ years of experience designing and building scalable,
    distributed software systems
  - 3–6 years of hands-on experience in Artificial Intelligence,
    Machine Learning, or a related domain
  - Proven experience delivering GenAI or AI/ML solutions end-
    to-end, from use case definition through production
    deployment, with exposure to agentic or autonomous systems
  - Strong understanding of infrastructure and DevOps practices
    for GenAI workloads, including cloud environments, LLM
    hosting, CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), and
    orchestration with Kubernetes
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Proficiency in Python and experience building APIs along
    with working knowledge of SQL
  - Familiarity with agentic AI frameworks and concepts such as
    LangChain, LangGraph, AutoGen, Model Context Protocol
    (MCP), large language models (LLMs), chain-of-thought
    prompting, knowledge stores, and embeddings
  - Experience developing autonomous agents using cloud-based AI
    services
  - Knowledge of prompt engineering techniques and model fine-
    tuning
  - Solid understanding of reinforcement learning, planning
    algorithms, and multi-agent systems
  - Experience deploying and operating AI solutions at scale on
    major cloud platforms, including AWS, Azure, or Google
    Cloud Platform
