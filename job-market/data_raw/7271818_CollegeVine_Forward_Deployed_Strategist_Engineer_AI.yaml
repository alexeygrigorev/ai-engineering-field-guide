  Who We Are:
  
  We deploy powerful AI agents in complex, regulated
  industries, specializing in building the systems that enable
  autonomous agents to operate entire functions securely and
  reliably. Our belief is that people should be free of
  administrative and operational drudgery so they can create
  value through creativity, reasoning, and judgement.
  
  We’re starting in higher education, a sector with ~$700B in
  expenses defined by heavy workflows across departments, such
  as admissions, financial aid, facilities, advising, student
  services, advancement, and more. Our agents are already
  embedded across these departments, interacting with millions
  of students and staff. They process applications, package
  aid, resolve verification issues, run large-scale
  communication workflows, handle student support tickets, and
  more.
  
  We believe that universities are among the most
  consequential institutions in the world, sitting at the
  foundation of social and economic progress. Improving how
  they operate improves who gets educated, who gets supported,
  and who gets a chance. When higher education runs better,
  everything built on top of it does too.
  
  About The Role:
  
  As a Forward Deployed Strategist at CollegeVine, you’ll
  partner directly with our university customers to solve
  their biggest challenges using data, AI, and web
  technologies. You’ll work in small, cross-functional teams,
  owning end-to-end delivery of high-stakes projects: from
  requirements gathering and architecture to code, deployment,
  and ongoing support.
  
  This role is ideal for someone who aspires to be both a
  technical leader and a strategic partner-think startup CTO
  meets solutions architect - with the opportunity to
  influence product direction and drive real outcomes for
  education institutions.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Customer Engagement & Discovery
    - Rapidly understand complex customer workflows and pain
      points.
    - Translate domain needs into valuable technical solutions.
  - End-to-End Delivery
    - Own design, development, testing, and deployment of custom
      features and integrations.
    - Collaborate with product managers, designers, engineers,
      data scientists, and customer success to iterate
      quickly.
  - Data-Driven Problem Solving
    - Leverage large‐scale datasets, LLMs, and AI agents to
      surface insights and automate workflows.
    - Build dashboards, APIs, or custom agents that drive
      measurable impact.
  - Travel & On-Site Collaboration
    - Occasional travel to client sites for discovery, workshops,
      training, and deployments.
  
  What We’re Looking For:
  
  - Experience & Expertise
    - 3+ years of product management, startup strategy &
      operations, consulting, investment banking, or software
      engineering experience, ideally including roles that
      involved solution delivery and customer-facing projects.
    - Proven ability to own complex projects end-to-end in a fast-
      moving environment.
  - Problem-Solving Mindset
    - Deeply analytical, with a knack for breaking down ambiguous
      challenges into concrete solutions.
    - Eagerness to learn new tools, frameworks, and research -
      especially in ML/AI.
  - Collaboration & Communication
    - Excellent interpersonal skills: able to bridge technical and
      non-technical audiences.
    - Humble, pragmatic, and coachable - valuing feedback and
      always seeking to raise the bar.
    - Making your work visible: share what you learn from
      customers with the broader org and make sure nobody is
      ever surprised by project status.
  - Entrepreneurial Drive
    - Aspires to grow into an engineering leader or product-
      centric role.
    - Comfortable stepping into uncharted territory and defining
      what “done” looks like.

  (Xiaomi, TikTok), and more. In 2020, after years of being a
  remote-friendly company, CollegeVine became a fully remote
