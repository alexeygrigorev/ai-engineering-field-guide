  About Norm Ai
  
  Norm Ai, the leading Legal & Compliance AI company, has a
  client base with a combined $30 trillion in assets under
  management. By turning legal code into AI code, Norm enables
  enterprises to move faster and more comprehensively in their
  legal and compliance processes with reliability and trust.
  
  Norm’s platform combines frontier AI, proprietary legal
  reasoning systems, and embedded legal and regulatory
  expertise.
  
  We have recently raised more than $140 million, backed by
  Blackstone, Bain Capital, Vanguard, Citi, New York Life,
  TIAA, Coatue, Craft Ventures, Henry R. Kravis (KKR co-
  founder), and Marc Benioff (Salesforce CEO).
  
  Norm Ai pioneered Legal Engineering, the process that
  empowers lawyers to build and supervise domain-specific AI
  agents with Norm’s proprietary suite of no-code software
  tools. We hired dozens of lawyers from premier U.S. law
  firms and trained them as Legal Engineers, who specialize in
  Large Language Model powered legal workflows.
  
  Norm Ai technology is deployed inside many of the largest
  and most consequential institutions in the world. The
  company is growing quickly and hiring across all teams.
