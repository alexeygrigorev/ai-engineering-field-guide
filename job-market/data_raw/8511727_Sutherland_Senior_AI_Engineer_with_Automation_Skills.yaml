  Job Description
  
  Role Intent
  
  This role is intended for experienced software developers,

  building and evolving automation frameworks and platforms
  used by multiple teams across our CXone division, including
  developing a new agentic AI–driven automation framework and
  unifying existing Playwright-based frameworks. Contractors
  will contribute to shared automation and framework backlogs
  under the direction of a Tech Manager based in Pune.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  Design, develop, and maintain shared automation frameworks
  and platform components.
  
  Translate production-derived workflows into reusable

  Contribute to CI/CD-integrated automation and service-level
  validation.
  
  Collaborate with architects and managers on backlog-driven
  delivery.
  
  Experience
  
  6–8 years of professional software development experience.
  
  Demonstrated experience building maintainable, extensible
  systems or frameworks.
  
  Core Technical Skills
  
  Strong object-oriented development experience (Java or C#
  preferred).
  
  Working experience with Python and TypeScript.
  
  Experience with modern automation/test frameworks
  (Playwright or similar).
  
  CI/CD experience, including pipeline integration and
  automation at scale.
  
  API and service-level automation experience (REST or event-
  driven systems).
  
  Familiarity with Jira and backlog-driven development.
  
  AI & Cloud
  
  Hands-on exposure to LLMs or AI-assisted development
  workflows.
  
  AWS experience; exposure to AI-related services is a plus.
  
  Practical mindset for applying AI to real engineering
  problems.
  
  Engineering Mindset
  
  Experience building shared libraries, internal frameworks,
  or developer platforms.
  
  Strong understanding of code quality, design patterns, and
  long-term maintainability.
