  Sr. AI Solutions Engineer
  
  About This Role
  
  Built’s new Agentic AI product helps lenders automate high-
  leverage operational workflows. As our Sr. AI Solutions
  Engineer, you’ll be the hands-on technical owner for driving
  customer onboarding and adoption — designing, building, and
  tuning agent workflows, prompts, and evaluations.
  
  This role sits within Built’s AI Solutions & Implementations
  Team and reports to the Head of Implementations. It exists
  to scale customer delivery and adoption for our new Agentic
  AI platform as we move from pilot to broad rollout —
  ensuring our clients achieve measurable value while shaping
  how the product evolves.
  
  You’ll partner with an Implementation Manager and an Agent
  Analyst and act as the technical expert to ensure customers
  love the product and get tremendous value.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Own prompt engineering & agent workflow design
    (tool/function calling, structured outputs, guardrails).
  - Translate client SOPs into production workflows; ensuring we
    account for the specific nuances of each client.
  - Operate and iterate with real client data to launch;
    troubleshoot and resolve issues quickly. Back-test new
    changes to existing data to ensure nothing breaks.
  - Act as the technical escalation point for 6–8 concurrent
    customers; enable clients and our Agent Analysts on best
    practices.
  - Instrument and report performance, create reusable
    templates/runbooks, and feed product requirements to
    Engineering.
  
  What Success Looks Like
  
  30 Days: You’ve learned the platform, shadowed multiple
  customer implementations, and built your first workflow end-
  to-end.
  
  60 Days: You’re owning technical delivery for active
  implementations and driving measurable value for customers.
  90 Days: You’ve built repeatable patterns, contributed to
  product feedback loops, and are trusted as the technical
  point person for new customer launches.
  
  What You’ll Bring
  
  - Experience in a customer-facing technical role (Solutions
    Engineer / Sales Engineer / Implementation Engineer) at a
    data/AI/infra company (e.g., Snowflake, Databricks,
    similar).
  - Deep, practical prompt engineering expertise (few/zero-shot
    design, tool/function calling, structured outputs, agents,
    retrieval).
  - Experience building agentic workflows with LLM providers
    (OpenAI/Anthropic/Azure).
  - Strong software engineering fundamentals; fluent in Python
    and/or TypeScript, REST/GraphQL APIs, and SQL.
  - Comfort creating evaluation pipelines, A/B tests, and
    analytics to measure quality, safety, and cost.
  - Excellent client communication—able to translate messy SOPs
    into deterministic workflows and drive to outcomes on
    tight timelines.
  - Bonus: Fintech/banking or B2B enterprise SaaS background;
    Snowflake/Databricks integrations; prompt
    observability/guardrails (e.g., Langfuse/MLflow-like
    tools); security & compliance awareness (SOC2, PII
    handling).
  
  Built’s salary range for this position is $150,000 -
  $205,000 USD per year. The pay range is designed to
  accommodate upward mobility in the role, therefore it
  encompasses the full span of proficiency levels for this
  role and we believe that the midpoint of the range is
  competitive in the market. Salary is just one component of
  Built's total compensation package for employees. Your total
  rewards package at Built will include equity, top-notch
  medical, dental and vision coverage, an unlimited PTO
  policy, and other benefits.
  
  Travel Requirement: The ability to travel for business
  purposes is an essential function of this role. Teammates
  must be able to travel at minimum twice per year to
  Nashville, TN or another designated location for company-
  wide events (e.g., "Connect Week"). Additional travel may be
  required based on business needs and role responsibilities.
  Perks:
  
  - The rare opportunity to radically disrupt a $1.5T industry
  - Competitive benefits including: uncapped vacation, health,
    dental & vision insurance
  - 401k with match and expedited vesting
  - Robust compensation package, including equity in the form of
    stock options

  variety of disciplines, each bringing their unique
  perspective to everything they do.

  where every employee can succeed, and we recruit, hire, and
