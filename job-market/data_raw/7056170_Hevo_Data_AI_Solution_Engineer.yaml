  About Hevo:
  
  At Hevo, we are changing the way companies leverage data to
  drive user experience, growth, and business processes. There
  has been a fundamental change in the amount of data
  companies are generating on a day-to-day basis. More and
  more users in an organization are now looking to use data to
  drive business decisions. Data is no longer a second-class
  citizen and companies are seeing data as a competitive
  advantage. We see this change and we are on a mission to
  change the way companies leverage their data.
  
  With a technology platform processing more than 100 billion
  records a month and doubling itself every 6 months, Hevo is
  poised for exponential growth in the coming future. This
  position provides a unique opportunity to create a massive
  impact on all existing and future customers of Hevo through
  technology innovation.
  
  If you are the one who is looking to take a leap of faith
  and work on the technology of the future, if you obsess over
  customer satisfaction and experience then we are looking for
  you.

  - Rapidly test new AI models and APIs, validate feasibility,
    and create MVPs.
  - Evaluate and document performance, accuracy, and usability
    for GTM use cases.
  - Cross-functional Collaboration

  - Ensure compliance, data privacy, and reliability in AI-
    driven workflows.
  
  What Success Looks Like
  
  - You’ve delivered 2–3 working AI prototypes that GTM teams
    actively use.
  - You’ve automated or optimized at least 2 GTM workflows,
    saving time and improving accuracy.
  - You’ve documented solutions in a way that makes them
    scalable and transferable.
  - You’ve demonstrated measurable impact on GTM productivity
    (hours saved, efficiency gains, improved decision-making).

  - Knowledge & Skills:
  - Strong understanding of AI/ML fundamentals (NLP, LLMs,
    embeddings, prompt engineering).
  - Proficiency in Python and working with APIs (REST/GraphQL).
  - Experience with prototyping tools/frameworks (Flask,
    FastAPI, Streamlit, or similar).
  - Familiarity with GTM systems such as Salesforce, HubSpot,
    Marketo, or BI tools (Tableau, Looker).
  - Strong problem-solving skills and ability to rapidly
    prototype creative solutions.
  - Upto 5 years of experience in building end-to-end
