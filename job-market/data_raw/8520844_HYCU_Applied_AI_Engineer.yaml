  Who We Are:
  
  Our Core Values: Authenticity, Grit and Empathy are at the
  heart of everything we do at HYCU. All of us at HYCU take
  ownership in shaping and contributing to our culture. We
  pride ourselves in developing an inclusive and diverse
  company that supports our employees and customers to do
  extraordinary things.
  
  
  
  The following is how we approach each Core Value:
  
  - Authenticity – To be authentic means to be who we are and do
    it well. Focus your energy on being who YOU are. Be true
    to yourself. Authenticity also extends to our products.
    Understanding where we are truly the best fit for our
    customers and when we are not. And finally, authenticity
    in relationships: ensuring that we are honest and do what
    we say we’re going to do.
  
  - Grit – To win we need to want it. Every team member needs to
    be able to jump in and help at every turn. Whether it’s
    staying late to help a colleague or customer or finding a
    better process and making sure it’s communicated cross-
    functionally. You just have to do it and love it…and never
    stop trying.
  
  - Empathy – We need to care about each other, about our
    clients, about our business, and about the world around
    us. That might seem like a tall order, but if we don’t
    live in a constant state of empathy, if we don’t strive to
    truly put ourselves in another person’s shoes, we cannot
    truly serve the market.
