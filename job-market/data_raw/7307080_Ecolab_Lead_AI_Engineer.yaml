  About the Role
  
  You’ll lead the architecture, development, and deployment of
  next-generation agentic AI systems that transform enterprise
  operations. These intelligent agents will autonomously
  orchestrate workflows, analyze real-time data, and embed
  decision-making across domains like finance, sales, and
  operations. You’ll guide cross-functional teams, mentor
  engineers, and ensure technical excellence across all stages
  of delivery. Microsoft AI Foundry will be a key platform for
  agent development, and Copilot Studio may be used optionally
  for few use cases.
  
  Day-to-Day Work Responsibilities
  
  - Architect and lead development of scalable, production-grade
    agentic AI systems.
  - Design serverless, event-driven workflows using Azure
    Functions, Logic Apps, and Power Automate.
  - Build and optimize ML models for predictive analytics,
    anomaly detection, and recommendations using Azure ML,
    Databricks, and Python.
  - Integrate agents with enterprise platforms such as SAP HANA,
    Salesforce, Snowflake, Kafka, and UiPath.
  - Ensure observability and reliability through Azure Monitor,
    logging, and alerting frameworks.
  - Define and enforce architecture patterns, reusable
    components, and governance standards.
  - Lead code reviews, technical design sessions, and agile
    ceremonies.
  - Leverage Microsoft AI Foundry to build and deploy agents
    that meet enterprise-grade standards.
  
  Leadership Responsibilities
  
  - Mentor and coach junior engineers, fostering a culture of
    innovation and technical excellence.
  - Drive cross-team collaboration and alignment on agentic AI
    strategy and execution.
  - Own delivery timelines, quality benchmarks, and stakeholder
    communication.
  - Champion best practices in DevOps, CI/CD, and model
    lifecycle management.
  - Stay ahead of trends in AI, machine vision, and IoT to guide
    strategic decisions.
  
  Cross-Functional Collaboration
  
  You will work closely with:
  
  - Data Scientists & ML Engineers – for model development and
    integration
  - Product Managers & UX Designers – aligning agent
    capabilities with user needs
  - Enterprise Architects & DevOps Engineers – ensuring
    scalability and deployment efficiency
  - Security & Compliance Teams – meeting regulatory and
    governance requirements
  - Business Stakeholders & SMEs – defining use cases and
    validating outcomes
  - Change Management & Enablement Teams – supporting adoption
    and training efforts
  
  Technology & Tools
  
  - Languages & Platforms: Python, Power Apps, Power Automate,
    Databricks, Snowflake
  - Enterprise Systems: SAP HANA, Kafka, UiPath
  - AI Platforms: Microsoft AI Foundry (highly preferred),
    Copilot Studio (optional)
  - Cloud & ML Tools: Azure Machine Learning, Azure DevOps,
    GitHub
  - Data & Observability: Vector Databases, Azure Monitor
  - Vision & IoT: Azure IoT Hub, OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch
    (for edge and vision-based agents)
  
  What you bring with you:
  
  - Proven experience leading AI engineering teams and
    delivering enterprise-grade solutions
  - Strong technical depth in AI/ML, cloud platforms, and
    agentic system design
  - Ability to navigate ambiguity, drive clarity, and influence
    across functions
  - Passion for building transformative AI systems that solve
    meaningful problems
