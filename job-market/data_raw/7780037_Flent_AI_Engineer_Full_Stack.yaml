  Hey — I’m Rishabh, co-founder & COO at Flent. I lead all
  things tech, platform, and cashflow here.
  
  I feel the Flent is a lot more than a grid of homes on an
  app. We are now building a platform for living.
  
  Renting in REAL life is extremely messy. Most people come
  with fuzzy requirements - “something close to my office,
  maybe ₹60k budget, should’ve good ventilation, non-smoking
  flatmates”. And on the supply side, every home is a new SKU
  with 100+ attributes. Traditional marketplace interfaces and
  journeys will never work.
  
  I think of our platform as a human broker in a software form
  - one that listens, interprets, and guides, rather than
  dumping endless choices. It should be able to explain “why
  this home” makes sense for you, do the trade-offs you’d
  otherwise struggle with, and build trust through speed and
  clarity.
  
  Good software makes choices smooth. Great software makes
  them vanish into a flow – that’s the bar I hold while
  building things at Flent.
  
  About the role
  
  We’re hiring our foundation engineering squad — the team
  that’ll lay the technical bedrock of Flent.
  
  You’ll work with product and design to build Flent’s digital
  renting ecosystem. Whether it’s search, payments, or real-
  time notifications, your code will power how thousands of
  people find and manage their homes. We are looking for AI-
  native engineers who can multiply output-scaffold, test, and
  refactor faster, while keeping quality and security high.
  
  More than anything, this is your chance to curate the kind
  of engineering culture you always wished for, built around
  people who care about doing their best work.
  
  What you’ll broadly do:
  
  - Architect the AI Broker You will own the strategic direction
    of our conversational search platform. Your goal is to
    move beyond filters, designing the core logic that
    understands renter intent and delivers curated,
    explainable home matches.
  - Build Spatial Home Tours You will lead the creation of a
    new-to-market virtual tour experience. This involves
    architecting the spatial interface from the ground up,
    capturing user interaction data within the 3D space, and
    using those signals to create a smarter, self-improving
    discovery engine.
  - Build the "Flent for Living" Platform You will be
    responsible for the entire resident-facing ecosystem. This
    includes the end-to-end development of features like
    integrated payments, smart access control, maintenance
    ticketing, and lifestyle service upgrades.
  - Define Foundational Engineering Culture As a member of the
    founding engineering team, you will establish the
    technical standards, security practices, and development
    methodologies that will define how Flent builds products
    for years to come.
  
  What your day-to-day will look like:
  
  - Develop backend APIs and services (Node/TS, Go, Python,
    Postgres, Redis, GraphQL/gRPC)
  - Build and optimize responsive UIs and 3D interactions
    (React/Next.js, WebGL, Three.js)
  - Integrate and productionize AI/NLP modules and ML-driven
    recommendation systems
  - Implement authentication, authorization, validation,
    monitoring, and logging
  - Profile, debug, and optimize 3D rendering, database, and API
    performance
  - Automate deployments, run tests, maintain CI/CD, manage
    feature flags
  - Analyze metrics, design/run A/B tests, iterate on user
    feedback
  - Review code, document technical decisions and run PR
    feedback rituals.
  
  We’re looking for someone who has:
  
  - Has 4–6 years of experience in software engineering, ideally
    across high-growth startups.
  - Is a product-minded builder — raises the bar beyond
    functionality, prioritizing UX, performance, and clarity.
  - fast adaptability — moves across backend, frontend, AI, and
    3D; learns new tools quickly.
  - Strong frontend chops: React/Next.js, modern state
    management, WebGL/Three.js for 3D, and performance
    budgets.
  - Brings backend strength — comfortable with at least one of
    Node/TS, Go, or Python; Postgres; has some experience with
    Redis; queues/streams; caching; auth; rate-limiting;
    infra-as-code; and cloud (AWS/GCP).
  - Is AI-native — uses copilots/agents for scaffolding, test
    writing, code search, and safe refactors — and knows when
    not to.
  - Understands data & retrieval — familiar with embeddings/RAG,
    vector stores (pgvector/others), and building
    ranking/feedback loops.
  - Practices strong engineering hygiene — testing strategy
    (unit/integration/property), static analysis, secure
    coding, privacy-aware logs, and clean rollbacks.
  - Converts data to action — through clean event design,
    meaningful dashboards, disciplined A/Bs, and fast
    translation of signals into product updates.
  - Operates with high agency and low ego — finds a way, moves
    fast, and keeps it real.
  
  Educational background doesn’t matter to us. What does is
  your attitude, your ability to take ownership, and your
  willingness to do what it takes to make landlords feel taken
  care of.
