  It's fun to work at a company where people truly believe in
  what they are doing!
  
  Job Description:
  
  We’re looking for a rare hybrid: an attorney with real
  experience in corporate legal work -- litigation,
  investigations, regulatory/compliance -- and who is equally
  energized by technology, AI, and building things.
  
  As a Legal Engineer, you will work side-by-side with
  scientists, engineers, and product leaders to build the next
  generation of AI systems for in-house legal teams and law
  firms. You will use your legal expertise and your technical
  instincts to shape datasets, workflows, capabilities, and
  use-cases that truly reflect how legal work is done in the
  real world.
  
  This is not a passive advisory role. It’s an applied,
  creative, and execution-heavy position at the intersection
  of law, product, AI research, and user experience.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  1. Build and Shape Legal Datasets
  
  - Design and synthesize realistic corpora representing
    litigation, investigations, compliance, ECA, privilege
    review, and corporate workflows.
  - Generate and annotate training and benchmarking datasets for
    AI models.
  - Partner with ML teams to define task specifications,
    evaluation metrics, and model requirements grounded in
    real legal use-cases.
  
  2. Drive Product and Use-Case Definition
  
  - Ideate, refine, and validate new product capabilities based
    on authentic attorney workflows and pain points.
  - Translate legal processes into structured workflows,
    runbooks, and agentic patterns for the AI platform.
  - Critically evaluate proposed features for real-world
    feasibility, risk, defensibility, and legal accuracy.
  
  3. Engage Directly With Clients
  
  - Join client conversations, demos, and sales meetings to
    translate technical concepts into language that resonates
    with attorneys.
  - Help articulate the value, differentiation, and
    defensibility of the platform to in-house counsel and law
    firm partners.
  - Collaborate with marketing to craft content, examples,
    demos, and narratives that speak to legal audiences.
  
  4. Prototype, Hack, and Build
  
  - Use AI tools, scripting, and light coding to prototype
    workflows, simulate datasets, or mock up product ideas.
  - Move quickly from concept → prototype → feedback →
    refinement.
  - Contribute to documentation, testing scenarios, and internal
    tools that accelerate the pace of innovation.
  
  5. Execute Reliably in a Fast, Ambitious Environment
  
  - Deliver high-quality work under deadlines.
  - Go deep, learn quickly, and iterate with the engineering
    team.
  - Contribute to a culture of creativity + hard execution --
    big ideas paired with disciplined follow-through.
  
  Who You Are
  
  Required Background
  
  - JD + active or prior bar membership.
  - 2–8+ years practicing law , ideally in one or more of:
    - Litigation
    - Government or internal investigations
    - E-discovery / document review oversight
    - Compliance, regulatory, white-collar, ECA
  - Deep familiarity with real workflows: privilege review,
    deposition prep, investigations, custodian interviews,
    factual development, matter management, etc.
  
  Technical / Product Orientation
  
  - Fluent in technology; comfortable working with engineers and
    product teams.
  - Ability to write simple scripts, prompt LLMs effectively,
    analyze outputs, or use AI tools creatively.
  - Strong instinct for how legal reasoning maps to data, rules,
    workflows, and model behavior.
  - Curiosity about how AI models work and desire to build
    systems that outperform today’s legal tech.
  
  Mindset
  
  - Hacker mentality: scrappy, curious, willing to experiment
    and build.
  - High execution: able to go heads-down and deliver.
  - Creative + rigorous: big ideas combined with legal
    defensibility and precision.
  - Motivated by building something new—not just using tools,
    but helping invent the next generation of them.
  - Comfortable in ambiguity, fast iteration, and rapid feedback
    cycles.
  
  Bonus Skills
  
  - Experience in e-discovery platforms, investigative
    workflows, or doc review management.
  - Exposure to ML/AI concepts, synthetic data generation, or
    structured knowledge representation.
  - Prior experience in legal tech, product design, research, or
    innovation-focused roles.
  
  Why Join Us
  
  - Work directly with world-class AI researchers and engineers
    building a first-of-its-kind corporate legal AI platform.
  - Influence the roadmap, design, and capabilities of flagship
    systems used by major corporations and global law firms.
  - Play a foundational role in shaping the future of legal
    practice and the next generation of intelligent legal
    infrastructure.
  - Move fast, collaborate deeply, and build something that
    truly matters.
