  AI Engineer
  
  Role Overview:
  
  As an AI Engineer at Particle41 you will design, develop and
  deploy machine-learning and deep-learning models/solutions
  (including generative-AI) that address complex business
  problems. You will collaborate with data scientists, data
  engineers, software engineers and client stakeholders. You
  will also build scalable pipelines, ensure production
  readiness, monitor performance and iterate proactively.
  
  In This Role, You Will:
  
  - Lead end-to-end development of AI/ML models: from data
    ingestion & preprocessing to model training, evaluation,
    deployment and monitoring.
  - Build generative-AI solutions (RAG, Agentic Workflows, MCP
    Servers, Conversation AI Agents) aligned with business
    goals.
  - Work closely with data engineering teams to build/maintain
    data pipelines, feature stores and orchestration
    frameworks.
  - Develop and integrate AI models into production systems
    (APIs, microservices, cloud deployments).
  - Optimize models/solutions for performance, scalability,
    robustness and cost-efficiency.
  - Monitor models/ solutions’ performance in production (drift,
    bias, fairness, reliability) and implement remediation.
  - Document model design, experiments, data provenance and
    solution rationale.
  - Stay abreast of latest AI/ML research, frameworks, tools
    (e.g. LangChain, LangGraph, MCP Clients/Servers, Agents
    SDKs, LiveKit etc.) and propose innovative ideas.
  - Work directly with clients to understand problem statements,
    translate business requirements into AI solutions, and
    clearly communicate results.
  
  Skills and Experience We Value:
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science,
    Engineering, Data Science, or related field.
  - 3+ years of hands-on experience in AI/ML model development
    and deployment.
  - Strong programming skills in Python and experience with
    major ML/AI frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn,
    LangChain, LangGraph).
  - Experience with vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS),
    RAG and Agentic workflows.
  - Experience building or fine-tuning Large Language Models
    (LLMs).
  - Experience deploying models into production: building REST
    APIs, microservices and monitoring.
  - Familiarity with Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-Text
    models/solutions like Deepgram, ElevenLabs, Cartesia etc.
  - Experience in computer vision, time-series modelling (ARIMA,
    Prophet) or multimodal AI.
  - Familiarity with MLOps tools and frameworks (e.g., MLflow,
    Kubeflow, SageMaker).
  - Strong understanding of algorithms, data structures,
    statistics, and machine-learning fundamentals
    (classification, regression, clustering, deep learning,
    sequence models).
  - Ability to work in a fast-paced, dynamic environment and
    adapt to changing priorities.
  
  - Publications, open-source contributions, or personal
    projects in the AI/ML domain
