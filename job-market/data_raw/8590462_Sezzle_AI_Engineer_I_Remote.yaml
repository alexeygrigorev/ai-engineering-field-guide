  About the Role:
  
  We are seeking a talented and motivated AI Engineer I who is
  best in class, with a high IQ and a high EQ. This role
  presents an exciting opportunity to thrive in a dynamic,
  fast-paced environment within a rapidly growing team, with
  strong prospects for continued growth and increased
  ownership.
  
  As an AI Engineer I on the Applied AI team, you will
  contribute to the development of platforms and systems that
  power Sezzle's AI-driven capabilities. Your work will span
  initiatives such as building AI-powered features, developing
  intelligent automation and agentic systems, and embedding AI
  solutions into customer-facing products, internal tools, and
  operational workflows.
  
  You will work closely with senior engineers and cross-
  functional teams to identify opportunities where AI can
  drive meaningful impact—whether that's enhancing the
  customer experience, improving decision-making, or
  automating complex workflows. This role is ideal for
  engineers early in their AI careers who want hands-on
  exposure to production-grade AI systems, with opportunities
  to grow into greater ownership and technical leadership over
  time.
  
  What You'll Do:
  
  - Contribute to the design and development of AI-powered
    platforms and systems, working alongside senior engineers
    on complex initiatives.
  - Own end-to-end delivery of complex projects, from problem
    discovery and system design through production rollout and
    iteration.
  - Build AI-driven features, intelligent automation, and
    agentic systems that enhance customer experiences and
    improve team productivity.
  - Embed AI capabilities into existing team workflows,
    products, and processes, ensuring solutions integrate
    naturally
  - Integrate AI capabilities into customer-facing products,
    internal tools, and operational workflows.
  - Build full-stack components spanning backend services, APIs,
    data layers, and frontend interfaces.
  - Translate business and operational problems into
    maintainable, AI-enabled technical solutions with guidance
    from senior team members.
  - Apply systems thinking to ensure reliability, performance,
    and security across platforms.
  - Collaborate with engineers, teams, and stakeholders across
    the company to understand requirements and deliver
    impactful solutions.
  - Participate in production support and incident response for
    team-owned systems, learning operational best practices.
  - Engage in code reviews and knowledge sharing to continuously
    improve skills and contribute to team growth.
  
  What We'll Look For:
  
  - 1–3 years of professional experience in software
    engineering, AI engineering, platform engineering, or
    related roles.
  - Hands-on experience designing, building, and shipping AI-
    powered systems into production environments.
  - Strong proficiency in Python, SQL, and frontend frameworks
    such as React.
  - Proven experience designing and owning production-grade
    full-stack systems.
  - Experience working with distributed systems, internal
    platforms, or complex data workflows.
  - Ability to operate effectively in ambiguous problem spaces
    and drive solutions with minimal direction.
  
  Preferred Qualifications:
  
  - Exposure to building AI-powered platforms or products,
    including contributing to architectural decisions.
  - Foundational knowledge of core machine learning and data
    science principles, including supervised/unsupervised
    learning, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
  - Familiarity with transformer architectures (BERT, GPT, etc.)
    and basic understanding of attention mechanisms,
    tokenization, and fine-tuning concepts.
  - Exposure to embeddings and vector representations, including
    text embeddings and similarity search concepts; interest
    in vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector, or
    similar).
  - Familiarity with NLP techniques such as text classification,
    named entity recognition, or semantic search.
  - Familiarity with real-world agentic frameworks workflow
    engines (e.g., in-house automation platforms,
    langchain/graph, n8n, Make, or similar), with a solid
    understanding of how they work under the hood.
  - Experience developing AI-assisted or agentic systems that
    interact with tools, data, or workflows.
  - Familiarity with cloud-native development using AWS.
  - Experience with containerized systems and orchestration
    tools such as Docker and Kubernetes.
  - Exposure to CI/CD pipelines and modern development workflows
    (e.g., GitLab).
  - Experience with Golang is a plus (or willingness to learn).
  
  About You:
  
  - You have relentlessly high standards - many people may think
    your standards are unreasonably high. You are continually
    raising the bar and driving those around you to deliver
    great results. You make sure that defects do not get sent
    down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay
    fixed.
  - You’re not bound by convention - your success—and much of
    the fun—lies in developing new ways to do things
  - You need action - speed matters in business. Many decisions
    and actions are reversible and do not need extensive
    study. We value calculated risk-taking.
  - You earn trust - you listen attentively, speak candidly, and
    treat others respectfully.
  
  What Makes Working at Sezzle Awesome:
  
  At Sezzle, we are more than just brilliant engineers,
  passionate data enthusiasts, out-of-the-box thinkers, and
  determined innovators. We believe in surrounding ourselves
  with only the best and the brightest individuals. Our
  culture is not defined by a certain set of perks designed to
