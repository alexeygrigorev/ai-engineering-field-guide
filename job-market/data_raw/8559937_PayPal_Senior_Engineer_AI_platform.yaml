  The Company
  
  PayPal has been revolutionizing commerce globally for more
  than 25 years. Creating innovative experiences that make
  moving money, selling, and shopping simple, personalized,
  and secure, PayPal empowers consumers and businesses in
  approximately 200 markets to join and thrive in the global
  economy.
  
  We operate a global, two-sided network at scale that
  connects hundreds of millions of merchants and consumers. We
  help merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete
  payments, whether they are online or in person. PayPal is
  more than a connection to third-party payment networks. We
  provide proprietary payment solutions accepted by merchants
  that enable the completion of payments on our platform on
  behalf of our customers.
  
  We offer our customers the flexibility to use their accounts
  to purchase and receive payments for goods and services, as
  well as the ability to transfer and withdraw funds. We
  enable consumers to exchange funds more safely with
  merchants using a variety of funding sources, which may
  include a bank account, a PayPal or Venmo account balance,
  PayPal and Venmo branded credit products, a credit card, a
  debit card, certain cryptocurrencies, or other stored value
  products such as gift cards, and eligible credit card
  rewards.  Our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products also make it
  safer and simpler for friends and family to transfer funds
  to each other. We offer merchants an end-to-end payments
  solution that provides authorization and settlement
  capabilities, as well as instant access to funds and
  payouts. We also help merchants connect with their
  customers, process exchanges and returns, and manage risk.
  We enable consumers to engage in cross-border shopping and
  merchants to extend their global reach while reducing the
  complexity and friction involved in enabling cross-border
  trade.
  
  Our beliefs are the foundation for how we conduct business
  every day.  We live each day guided by our core values of
  Inclusion, Innovation, Collaboration, and Wellness.
  Together, our values ensure that we work together as one
  global team with our customers at the center of everything
  we do – and they push us to ensure we take care of
  ourselves, each other, and our communities.
