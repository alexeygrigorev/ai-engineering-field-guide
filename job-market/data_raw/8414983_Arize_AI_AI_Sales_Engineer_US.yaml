  About Arize
  
  AI is rapidly transforming the world. As generative AI
  reshapes industries, teams need powerful ways to monitor,
  troubleshoot, and optimize their AI systems. That’s where we
  come in. Arize AI is the leading AI & Agent Engineering
  observability and evaluation platform, empowering AI
  engineers to ship high-performing, reliable agents and
  applications. From first prototype to production scale,
  Arize AX unifies build, test, and run in a single
  workspace—so teams can ship faster with confidence.
  
  We’re a Series C company backed by top-tier investors, with
  over $135M in funding and a rapidly growing customer base of
  150+ leading enterprises and Fortune 500 companies.
  Customers like Booking.com, Uber, Siemens, and PepsiCo
  leverage Arize to deliver AI that works.
  
  The Team
  
  Our engineering team builds systems that interact with some
  of the most complex software ever deployed in production.
  The team is composed of industry veterans that have built
  deep learning infrastructure, autonomous drones, ridesharing
  marketplaces, ad tech and much more. We are looking for an
  AI Sales Engineer to join the good fight and get this
  product in the hands of every Machine Learning organization.
  
  You'll work side-by-side with our Account Executives to
  articulate the Arize value and overall strategy to
  differentiate the platform throughout the sales process and
  drive POCs from requirements gathering to close. The
  activities performed by an AI Sales Engineer are diverse -
  one day you might be assisting with a high-level pitch of
  Arize to a CDO, and the next day you might be working hands-
  on to develop a small proof of concept.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  You are the trusted advisor to the customer:
  
  - Build relationships with technical stakeholders
  - Lead product demonstrations of the Arize platform
  - Lead discovery to understand prospect’s ML stack to
    collaborate with the Sales team to construct a compelling
    value proposition of the Arize Platform
  - Handle technical objections and develop strategies across
    sales, engineering, and product to unblock them
  
  Act as a Domain Expert within AI/ML:
  
  - Write educational and compelling blog posts about ML and
    MLOps related topics
  - Collaborate to create and enhance documentation, recorded
    video assets and other publically available as well as
    internal enablement materials
  - Engage in relevant ML communities online to raise awareness
    on challenges of deploying ML in production
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  Strong Communication Skills:
  
  - You can empathize with the frame of reference of who you are
    communicating with and tailor your message and approach
    accordingly.
  - Ability to simplify complex, technical concepts
  
  A quick and self learner:
  
  - You are undaunted by the technical complexity of production
    ML deployments and welcome the challenge to learn about
    them and develop your own POV.
  - You ask the right questions with the customer to uncover
    nuances in their unique deployments.
  - Ability to work within ambiguity and take action with
    limited direction
  
  Knowledgeable in Machine Learning:
  
  - You may not have a PhD in ML but you know the difference
    between Linear Regression and Boosted Trees and the
    advantages / disadvantages of each.
  - You have some experience training models in common packages
    such as scikit-learn, HuggingFace, fastai, and etc.
  
  5+ years within customer facing role:
  
  - Pre-sales, technical account management, or consulting
    experience
  - Worked with customers within the high enterprise (e.g.
    Fortune 500, etc)
  
  Proficiency in:
  
  - Python
  - Linux/Unix
  
  Bonus Points, But Not Required
  
  - Previous experience working across and aligning Sales,
    Product, and Engineering
  - Previous experience within a team that underwent a high
    growth stage
  - Previous engineering experience in: Data Engineering, MLOps,
    Kubernetes, GCP / AWS / Azure
  
  The estimated annual salary and variable compensation for
  this role is between $140,000 - $230,000, plus a competitive
  equity package. Actual compensation is determined based upon
  a variety of job related factors that may include:
  transferable work experience, skill sets, and
  qualifications. Total compensation also includes a
  comprehensive benefit package, including: medical, dental,
  vision, 401(k) plan, unlimited paid time off, generous
  parental leave plan, and others for mental and wellness
  support.
  
  While we are a remote-first company, we have opened offices
  in New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area, as an
  option for those in those cities who wish to work in-person.
  For all other employees, there is a WFH monthly stipend to
  pay for co-working spaces.
