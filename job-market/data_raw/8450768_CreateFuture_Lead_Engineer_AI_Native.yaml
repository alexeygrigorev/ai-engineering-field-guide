  all elements of our business, from pre-sales through to
  marketing and thought leadership - you’re not afraid to lean
  in and contribute wherever an opportunity presents itself.
  You have excellent consulting skills - you love
  appropriately challenging the client context or requirements
  to lead them towards a better outcome. You care deeply about
  software craftsmanship,  designing and building and shipping
  high-quality, maintainable systems and you use AI as a force
  multiplier to amplify your own impact and raise the bar for
  the teams you work with. You’ve got a real appreciation of
  operational, commercial and cultural impact of making
  changes to ways of working through the use of AI and you
  ensure safe and ethical applications and You enjoy helping
  simplify problems, make decisions, and have a bias to build
  and test over analysis paralysis, taking responsibility for
  overall outcomes, not just the implementation, and are
  influential You’ve got a clear communications style, and
  love using your experience to help others succeed through
  mentoring and coaching.
  
  What you’ll be doing:
  
  - Work closely with client teams to understand their context,
    constraints, and goals, and help turn ambiguous problems
    into clear, workable approaches.
  - Design and build software across different parts of a
    system, making pragmatic decisions that balance speed,
    quality, and long term maintainability.
  - Use AI tools extensively and usefully throughout the
    delivery lifecycle to support research, context
    exploration, architecture, implementation, testing, and
    documentation, while ensuring decisions and changes are
    traceable and explainable.
  - Build and coach quality from the start by applying AI to
    strong foundational techniques such as observability,
    verification and build automation.
  - Help clients make deliberate AI focused technology and
    tooling choices that avoid unnecessary lock in and allow
    delivery approaches to evolve as cost, regulation, or
    capability changes.
  - Share learning with both client teams and CreateFuture
    colleagues to improve delivery practices over time.
    Deliver external thought leadership at conferences and
    meetups to improve our brand presence and credibility.

  - Have significant experience building and maintaining
    production software and understands the core
    responsibilities and accountabilities that come with it,
    irrespective of AI

    around common languages/stacks that are in use in
    Production, for example within the Java, .NET or Web
    engineering ecosystems
  - Have experience of designing, building and operating
    software systems in at least one Cloud hyperscaler. You
    feel confident and comfortable owning the underlying
    workload infrastructure for your domain boundary, making
    architecture decisions and engaging with platform and
    architecture functions.
  - Whilst we don’t expect you to be an expert in Design,
    Product or Delivery, you will have an appreciation and
    good general understanding of those disciplines - our
    belief is you will be able to accelerate outcomes with
    your T-shaped thinking and application of good general
    problem solving skills & AI to derive  specific domain
    context
  - Are comfortable with ambiguity and is happy working across
    multiple parts of a system rather than focusing on a
    single framework or layer
  - Uses AI tools to scale execution, while remaining
    accountable for the outcomes they produce.
  - Have a commercial mindset, solves pain points to drive
    business outcomes within client constraints and technology
    risk. Is comfortable with ambiguity and relishes the
