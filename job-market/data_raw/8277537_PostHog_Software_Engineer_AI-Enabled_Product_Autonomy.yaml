  About PostHog
  
  We're shipping every product that companies need to run
  their business from their first day, to the day they IPO,
  and beyond. The operating system for folks who build
  software.
  
  We started with open-source product analytics, launched out
  of Y Combinator's W20 cohort. We've since shipped more than
  a dozen products, including:
  
  - A built-in data warehouse, so users can query product and
    customer data together using custom SQL insights.
  - A customer data platform, so they can send their data
    wherever they need with ease.
  - PostHog AI, an AI-powered analyst that answers product
    questions, helps users find useful session recordings, and
    writes custom SQL queries.
  
  Next on the roadmap are CRM, Workflow, revenue analytics,
  and support products. When we say every product that
  companies need to run their business, we really mean it!
  
  We are:
  
  - Product-led. More than 100,000 companies have installed
    PostHog, mostly driven by word-of-mouth. We have intensely
    strong product-market fit.
  - Default alive. Revenue is growing 10% MoM on average, and
    we're very efficient. We raise money to push ambition and
    grow faster, not to keep the lights on.
  - Well-funded. We've raised more than $100m from some of the
    world's top investors. We're set up for a long, ambitious
    journey.
  
  We're focused on building an awesome product for end users,
  hiring exceptional teammates, shipping fast, and being as
  weird as possible.
  
  Things we care about
  
  - Transparency: Everyone can read about our roadmap, how we
    pay (or even let go of) people, our strategy, and how we
    work, in our public company handbook. Internally, we share
    revenue, notes and slides from board meetings, and
    fundraising plans, so everyone has the context they need
    to make good decisions.
  - Autonomy: We don’t tell anyone what to do. Everyone chooses
    what to work on next based on what's going to have the
    biggest impact on our customers, and what they find
    interesting and motivating to work on. Engineers lead
    product teams and make product decisions. Teams are
    flexible and easy to change when needed.
  - Shipping fast: Why not now? We want to build a lot of
    products; we can't do that shipping at a normal pace.
    We've built the company around small teams – autonomous,
    highly-efficient groups of cracked engineers who can
    outship much larger companies because they own their
    products end-to-end.
  - Time for building: Nothing gets shipped in a meeting. We're
    a natively remote company. We default to async
    communication – PRs > Issues > Slack. Tuesdays and
    Thursdays are meeting-free days, and we prioritize heads
    down building time over perfect coordination. This will be
    the most productive job you've ever had.
  - Ambition: We want to solve big problems. We strongly believe
    that aiming for the best possible upside, and sometimes
    missing, is better than never trying. We're optimistic
    about what's possible and our ability to get there.
  - Being weird: Weird means redesigning an already world-class
    website for the 5th time. It means shipping literally
    every product that relates to customer data. It means
    building an objectively unnecessary developer toy with
    dubious shareholder value. Doing weird stuff is a
    competitive advantage. And it's fun.
  
  Who we're looking for
  
  You'll join the Twig team, which is building an AI-enabled
  product development loop to achieve "product autonomy". Our
  vision is to replace the current human-driven cycle with an
  AI-first workflow. We're creating a desktop app alternative
  to IDEs, designed as an agentic development environment.
  This means orchestrating multiple AI agents (not just
  stateless coding assistants) and enriching them with PostHog
  product data. You'll scale the language model gateway to
  handle 10K–100K requests/second, ensuring low latency and
  high reliability. You'll build and optimize coding sandboxes
  for AI agents, enabling safe, isolated execution of
  generated code. You'll contribute to the AI-first product
  development loop, from analysis to auto-merge, with a focus
  on robustness and scalability.
  
  You'll fit right in if
  
  - You're a backend-focused builder. You have professional
    experience with Python and TypeScript, and you're open to
    other languages (no tech stack zealotry here)
  - You thrive in scale-up environments. You've experienced the
    journey from unicorn to decacorn growth and understand the
    real challenges of scaling (not just Big Tech
    abstractions)
  - You love solving hard problems. Whether it's optimizing
    gateway performance or designing sandboxing systems,
    you're driven by impact
  - You believe in engineering-led decision-making. You want to
    work where engineering and product teams function as one
    unified unit
  - You're excited about AI-enabled autonomy. You'll help build
    the infrastructure that powers AI analysis, coding, and
    review, and ultimately, auto-merged features
  
  If you have a disability, please let us know if there's any
  way we can make the interview process better for you - we're
  happy to accommodate!
