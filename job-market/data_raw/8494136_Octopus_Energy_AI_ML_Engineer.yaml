title: AI/ ML Engineer
company: Octopus Energy
location: London, GBR
work_type: FULL_TIME
level: Senior level
company_size: 724 Employees
description: |
  Octopus was founded with a mission to use technology to
  accelerate us towards a low-carbon future. That’s why we
  created Kraken - our own technology platform from scratch
  which now serves over 70 million households and is a core
  reason why Octopus is the number one energy supplier in the
  UK. We do it by hiring clever, curious, and self-driven
  people, enabling them with modern tools and infrastructure
  and giving them lots of autonomy.
  
  We have been using GenAI in live, customer-facing
  environments since 2022, including one system that creates
  tens of thousands of high-quality emails for our Energy
  Specialists, combining our deep knowledge of the energy
  industry and the Octo communication style with customer-
  specific data from Kraken.
  
  We are now looking for an AI/ML Engineer. You will take
  ownership of building and scaling the systems that allow
  Octopus teams to use Generative AI models (LLMs, RAG,
  agents). This may take the form of a platform, shared
  services, or other scalable infrastructure. You will work
  with a cross-functional team to build out flagship AI
  projects and will continue to develop the best practice for
  how we work with AI at Octopus.
  
  You’ll report into the Head of AI and work on developing
  solutions that genuinely move us closer to Net Zero in a
  company passionate about building great technology to change
  the way customers use energy. You’ll have wide open problems
  to solve, so you’ll need to be comfortable with ambiguity,
  figuring out an approach and validating it fast.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Design and Develop AI Platform Services - Build reusable,
    scalable services that expose GenAI models, knowledge
    retrieval pipelines, and agent workflows to application
    teams.
  - Knowledge Base Development - Build and maintain knowledge
    retrieval systems including embedding generation,
    chunking, and strategies for database management.
  - AI Ops, evals and observability - Setting up frameworks for
    monitoring and evaluating AI output quality (relevance,
    accuracy, safety, drift, cost) and platform observability
    (latency, cost, usage).
  - Context Engineering - Design systems for prompt assembly:
    Create prompt templates, system prompts and guidelines for
    platform users.
  
  What You’ll Have
  
  - Deep Understanding of GenAI - experience working with LLMs.
  - Data Product Development - experience building Python-based
    applications and/or data products, with hands-on work in
    data-intensive and machine learning systems.
  - AI model evaluation and observability - Experience of
    different ways of evaluating AI models and applications.
    Implementing logging, tracing, and monitoring in systems.
  - Context Engineering and Knowledge Grounding - Experience of
    optimising and grounding GenAI models and applications
    through prompt design, RAG and knowledge base integration.
  - Software Development Practices - Strong grounding in Git,
    testing, CI/CD frameworks.
  - Ability to thrive in a fast moving environment - Dealing
    with ambiguity, setting clear priorities, and translating
    ideas into actionable plans.
  
  It would be great if you had
  
  - GenAI Application Development - Hands-on experience of
    building AI applications.
  - Experience of using techniques such as tool calling, agentic
    workflows, finetuning and reinforcement learning.
  - Backend Development - Experience designing and building
    applications and services that encapsulate business logic,
    data and information flows and connect AI models into
    wider applications
  - Pipeline Design and Build - Experience integrating different
    types of databases and building and optimising data
    pipelines.
