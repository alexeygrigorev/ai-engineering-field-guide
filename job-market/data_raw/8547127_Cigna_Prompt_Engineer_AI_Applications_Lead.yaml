  About the Role
  
  Cigna is accelerating responsible AI adoption across the
  enterprise. We’re seeking a Prompt Engineer & AI
  Applications Lead to partner with product, data,
  engineering, and business stakeholders to discover,
  evaluate, and scale AI use cases—while ensuring safety,
  compliance, and measurable value. This role blends hands‑on
  prompt design with business relationship management and
  vendor collaboration to drive outcomes across multiple time
  zones.
  
  What You’ll Do (Key Responsibilities)
  
  AI Use Case Discovery & Shaping
  
  - Identify, qualify, and prioritize high‑impact AI
    opportunities across functions (operations, clinical,
    customer support, finance, IT).
  
  - Facilitate discovery workshops to define problem statements,
    success metrics, guardrails, and adoption plans.
  
  - Translate business needs into AI solution patterns (e.g.,
    retrieval‑augmented generation, summarization,
    classification, extraction, assistants/agents).
  
  Prompt Engineering & Experimentation
  
  - Design, test, and optimize prompts, chains, and system
    instructions for performance, safety, and reliability
    across multiple LLMs and tools.
  
  - Develop prompt evaluation frameworks (A/B tests, golden
    sets, bias & hallucination checks, cost/latency tracking).
  
  - Create reusable prompt templates, style guides, and prompt
    libraries for enterprise use.
  
  Vendor & Partner Management
  
  - Assess AI vendors for capability, compliance, total cost of
    ownership, integration complexity, and roadmap fit.
  
  - Co‑develop POCs/pilots with vendors; define SLAs, acceptance
    criteria, and transition plans to scale or sunset.
  
  - Coordinate security, privacy, legal, and procurement
    reviews; document decisions and risks.
  
  Solution Delivery & Governance
  
  - Partner with Data/ML Engineering to integrate RAG pipelines,
    guardrails, and observability (prompt logs, red‑teaming
    results, monitoring).
  
  - Ensure adherence to responsible AI, data privacy, and
    healthcare compliance requirements (e.g., PHI handling,
    HIPAA‑aligned processes in consultation with compliance
    teams).
  
  - Contribute to model cards, risk assessments, and
    human‑in‑the‑loop controls.
  
  Stakeholder Enablement & BRM
  
  - Serve as a trusted advisor to business leaders—clarify value
    cases, manage expectations, and align roadmaps and
    budgets.
  
  - Build enablement materials (playbooks, demos, FAQs) and
    deliver training for non‑technical and technical
    audiences.
  
  - Communicate progress, risks, and ROI via clear narratives
    and dashboards.
  
  What You’ll Bring (Qualifications)
  
  Must‑Have
  
  - ~5+ years of relevant experience in AI/ML product work,
    data‑driven solutions, or technical consulting, with at
    least 2+ years hands‑on prompt engineering (or
    demonstrable expertise).
  
  - Business Relationship Management (BRM) experience:
    stakeholder alignment, requirements shaping, roadmap
    facilitation, and value realization.
  
  - Proficiency with LLMs and tooling (e.g., prompt design,
    few‑shot techniques, function calling/tools, vector
    search/RAG, evaluation methods).
  
  - Practical knowledge of data fundamentals (data quality,
    governance, metadata, PII/PHI concepts) and safe AI
    patterns.
  
  - Strong communication: can translate complex AI concepts for
    executives and non‑technical teams; excellent storytelling
    and documentation.
  
  - Collaborative mindset and experience working across multiple
    time zones and cross‑functional teams.
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in a relevant field (Computer Science,
    Data/AI, Engineering, or related); equivalent experience
    considered.
  
  - Location: Madrid, Spain
  
  Nice‑to‑Have
  
  - Experience in healthcare/insurance processes and analytics.
  
  - Familiarity with evaluation frameworks (e.g., golden
    datasets, rubric‑based scoring), guardrails/red‑teaming,
    and observability.
  
  - Exposure to MLOps/LangChain/LlamaIndex, vector databases,
    and API integration patterns.
  
  - Practical understanding of responsible AI principles and
    risk controls; experience partnering with
    Legal/Privacy/Compliance.
  
  - Comfort with one or more languages or tools (Python, SQL,
    REST APIs, YAML), and with cloud platforms
    (Azure/AWS/GCP).
  
  Success Metrics (KPIs)
  
  - Validated use cases discovered per quarter and percent
    advancing from POC → Pilot → Scale.
  
  - Model quality gains (e.g., accuracy, factuality, reduction
    in hallucination) and experience metrics (latency, cost
    per task).
  
  - Risk reduction (guardrail coverage, incident rate, red‑team
    findings addressed).
  
  - Stakeholder satisfaction (NPS/CSAT) and enablement reach
    (teams trained, assets reused).
  
  - Vendor outcomes (SLA adherence, value realization, cost
    savings/avoidance).
  
  Ways of Working
  
  - Hybrid work with core collaboration hours overlapping
    European and India time zones; occasional evening/morning
    meetings to align with global teams.
  
  - Limited travel for workshops or vendor evaluations as
    needed.
  
  - Partner closely with Product Owners, Data/ML Engineering,
    Architecture, Security, Privacy, Legal, and Procurement.
