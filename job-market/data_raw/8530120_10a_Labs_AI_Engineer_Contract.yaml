  About 10a Labs: 10a Labs is the safety and threat-
  intelligence layer trusted by frontier AI labs, AI unicorns,
  Fortune 10 companies, and leading global technology
  platforms. Our adversarial red teaming, model evaluations,
  and intelligence collection enable engineering, safety, and
  security teams to stay ahead of evolving threats and deploy
  AI systems safely.
  
  About the role: 10a Labs is seeking an AI Engineer for a
  four-month contract (potential to extend) to partner closely
  with engineers and internal teams to design and implement
  cutting-edge AI solutions. You’ll build practical systems
  that leverage modern language models that will be applied to
  real-world problems.
  
  This role blends applied AI expertise, strong engineering
  fundamentals, and creative problem-solving. You’ll prototype
  quickly, iterate rapidly, and translate emerging model
  capabilities into reliable, production-ready systems.
  
  In this role, you will:
  
  - Design and implement AI-driven systems using AI APIs in
    creative and smart ways.
  - Build prototypes and production workflows that leverage
    language models for tasks such as classification,
    evaluation, and synthetic data generation.
  - Integrate AI APIs, vector stores, and supporting
    infrastructure to enable scalable applications.
  - Experiment with and evaluate both hosted and open-source
    models where appropriate.
  - Partner with product managers, analysts, and technical
    writers to translate complex systems into well-defined
    requirements and clear external materials.
  - Provide technical feedback to product and engineering teams
    to improve system quality and performance.
  
  We’re looking for someone who:
  
  - Has experience in AI engineering, software engineering, or
    applied ML roles.
  - Is highly comfortable using modern coding copilots and
    model-assisted development tools (e.g., Claude Code,
    Codex, or similar).
  - Has hands-on experience working with model provider APIs.
  - Is scrappy, creative, and able to iterate quickly in
    ambiguous problem spaces.
  - Operates with autonomy and strong problem-solving skills,
    managing multiple projects simultaneously.
  - Is collaborative, detail-oriented, and thrives in fast-
    moving, high-impact environments.
  - Has experience with end-to-end ownership of complex
    technical challenges.
  
  Requirements:
  
  - At least 1+ year experience in AI engineering or research,
    or 3-5 years of experience in software engineering or
    similar roles.
  - Strong applied AI experience, including working knowledge of
    AI systems and AI APIs or open-source models.
  - Experience with vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate,
    FAISS, Milvus) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
    architectures.
