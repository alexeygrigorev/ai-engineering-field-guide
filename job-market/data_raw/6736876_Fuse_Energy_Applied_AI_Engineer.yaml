description: |
  Fuse Energy is a forward-thinking renewable energy startup
  on a mission to deliver a terawatt of renewable energy -
  fast. We're combining first-principles thinking with
  cutting-edge technology to build a radically better energy
  system. We raised $170M from top-tier investors including
  Multicoin, Balderton, Lakestar, Accel, Creandum,
  Lowercarbon, Ribbit, Box Group and strategic angels like
  Nico Rosberg, the Co-Founder of Solana and GPs behind Meta,
  Revolut, Spotify, Uber and more. We’re creating a fully
  integrated energy company: from developing solar, wind and
  hydrogen projects to real-time power trading and distributed
  energy installations. By selling directly to consumers, we
  cut out the middleman, lower costs and pass on savings to
  customers. But we’re not stopping there. We’re also building
  the Energy Network: a decentralised platform of smart
  devices that rewards users in Energy Dollars for
  electrifying their homes, shifting usage to off-peak hours,
  and helping balance the grid. This network strengthens grid
  stability - a critical foundation for scaling AI data
  centers and other energy-intensive industries. We're now
  looking to establish a cutting-edge AI team. As an Applied
  AI Engineer, this position is ideal for someone who
  possesses the technical expertise of a backend engineer but
  is specifically interested in applied AI and how it can be
  used to enhance the energy experience for our customers and
  our internal operations. You'll be working on a variety of
  exciting projects, including consumer-focused features like
  the Energy Co-Pilot and the Speedy Onboarding process
  (leveraging tools such as VLM/LLM). You will also
  collaborate across teams to build AI tools that enhance
  productivity and streamline processes within Fuse.
  
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Design, develop and deploy AI-powered features that directly
    impact consumer experiences, including personalised energy
    recommendations and seamless onboarding via AI models
    (e.g. using energy bills for quick setup)
  - Build and optimise internal AI tools that will make the
    whole company more productive with a focus on automation
    and enhancing workflows
  - Collaborate with backend engineers and data scientists to
    integrate AI-driven features into our platforms
  - Collaborate with the trading and operations teams to ensure
    AI models are aligned with real-time market conditions and
    energy pricing
  - Improve AI models to optimise trading strategies by
    anticipating market shifts based on weather and demand
    forecasts
  - Stay up to date with the latest advancements in applied AI
    and machine learning and apply them to solve real-world
    problems within the energy space
  - Monitor the performance of AI tools and models, ensuring
    they are functioning efficiently and effectively
  
  Requirements
  
  - Minimum 3 years of engineering experience
  - Proven experience as a Backend Engineer with a strong
    interest and practical experience in applied AI or machine
    learning
  - Strong programming skills in Python (or similar languages)
    with familiarity in AI/ML libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch,
    etc.)
  - Experience working with large-scale models (LLMs/VLMs) and
    deploying AI-driven solutions into production
  - Solid understanding of cloud technologies, containerisation
    and building scalable AI applications
  - Ability to integrate AI/ML models into real-world
    applications, focusing on usability and performance
  - Strong problem-solving skills and a practical approach to
    implementing AI solutions in a fast-paced environment
  - Experience working with large datasets, particularly in
    relation to demand and supply forecasting
  
  Bonus
  
  - Experience or strong interest in energy markets and trading
    strategies
  - Understanding of weather forecasting, energy demand
    patterns, and production modelling
  - Exposure to Natural Language Processing (NLP) or other
    related fields
