  where all perspectives and voices are represented, valued,
  respected, and heard. We create spaces to empower everyone
  to speak up, make change, and drive the culture at AHEAD.

  AHEAD.
  
  Role Overview
  
  The AI Engineer is a hands-on builder who develops and
  deploys agentic AI solutions for AHEAD’s clients. You will
  work on multi-agent workflows, retrieval pipelines, and
  system integrations that automate real business processes
  like document handling, SDLC tasks, service desk actions,
  reporting, and decision support.
  
  This role focuses on implementing and improving components
  within larger agentic systems. You will collaborate closely
  with senior engineers, solution managers, and client teams
  to translate ideas into working automations. It is an ideal
  role for someone eager to deepen their skills in applied AI,
  workflow orchestration, and enterprise integration.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Agentic Solution Development
  - Build and customize agents using frameworks such as
    LangChain, LangGraph, Autogen, CrewAI, or LlamaIndex.
  - Implement components for document processing, workflow
    automation, data retrieval, and structured output
    generation.
  - Develop and maintain vector DB pipelines (Pinecone,
    pgvector, Elasticsearch) and RAG-based retrieval
    workflows.
  - Configure LLM/SLM endpoints, tool-calling functions, and
    agent memory/state handling.
  - Workflow & Integration Engineering
  - Implement real-time and batch workflows using Python, Kafka,
    EventBridge, Airflow, Celery, Snowflake, S3, or n8n.
  - Build integrations with enterprise tools (SharePoint,
    Salesforce, ServiceNow, Jira, APIs).
  - Support data transformations, validation, and versioning
    needed for downstream agent operations.
  - Quality, Testing & Observability
  - Write tests for agent behavior, pipelines, and model output
    consistency.
  - Contribute to monitoring, logging, metrics, and guardrail
    configurations for agentic systems.
  - Participate in debugging sessions and post-incident reviews
    with senior engineers.
  - Client Delivery Support
  - Participate in client workshops, demos, and working sessions
    as part of the engineering team.
  - Translate requirements from senior engineers or solution
    managers into technical tasks and working components.
  - Help document solution behavior, configurations, and
    deployment steps for clients.
  - Security, Governance & Responsible AI
  - Follow established patterns for access control, data
    handling, safe model usage, and auditing.
  - Ensure compliance and guardrail configurations are
    consistently applied in implementations.
  - Team Collaboration & Growth
  - Contribute to internal documentation, code templates, and
    reusable building blocks.
  - Learn and apply AHEAD’s reference architectures, best
    practices, and agentic patterns.
  - Support onboarding of new engineers and collaborate in agile
    ceremonies.
