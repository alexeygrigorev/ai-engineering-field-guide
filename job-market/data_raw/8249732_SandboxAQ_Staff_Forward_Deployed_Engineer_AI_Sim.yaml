  At SandboxAQ, we’ve cultivated an environment that
  encourages creativity, collaboration, and impact. By
  investing deeply in our people, we’re building a thriving,
  global workforce poised to tackle the world's epic
  challenges. Join us to advance your career in pursuit of an
  inspiring mission, in a community of like-minded people who
  value entrepreneurialism, ownership, and transformative
  impact.
  
  The Opportunity
  
  As a Staff Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) within our AI
  Simulation group, you will act as the primary technical
  bridge between our core Large Quantitative Models (LQMs) and
  our most ambitious client contracts. This is a high-agency
  "builder" role designed for a resourceful generalist who
  thrives on autonomy and is passionate about tackling the
  hardest challenges in drug discovery and chemical
  simulation. You will be embedded directly with scientific
  delivery teams, operating at the frontiers of knowledge
  where fundamental research converges with practical, real-
  world impact.
  
  Your central purpose is to ensure the technical enablement
  and success of our most critical partnerships. You will be
  expected to independently discern complex bottlenecks,
  architect custom solutions, and orchestrate compute at
  scale. Whether you are wrapping scientific application
  logic, managing massive data transformations, or integrating
  with Agentic systems, you will own the entire lifecycle of
  your deployments. This role demands a "startup" mindset: the
  seniority to lead a project's technical vision and the
  humility to execute any task necessary to move the mission
  forward.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Orchestrate Technical Delivery: Partner with scientific
    teams to audit workflows, diagnose technical blockers, and
    take full accountability for the end-to-end technical
    execution of client contracts.
  - Architect and Develop Solutions: Design and deploy high-
    velocity code to extend existing tools, or build new
    frameworks for wrapping scientific logic and automating
    complex R&D workflows.
  - Drive Cross-Functional Collaboration: Serve as the technical
    translator between non-technical researchers and product
    teams, validating proposed solutions and ensuring they
    meet rigorous scientific requirements.
  - Scale and Optimize Infrastructure: Own the deployment and
    maintenance of cloud-based compute resources and data
    pipelines, ensuring stability and performance throughout
    the contract lifecycle.
  - Pioneer Technical Integration: Lead the integration of
    internal core technologies, such as LQMs and Agentic
    systems, into bespoke client environments to solve major
    scientific challenges.
  
  Essential Skills & Experience
  
  - 7+ years of professional software development experience,
    with deep proficiency in Python and modern architectural
    patterns.
  - Proven ability to operate independently in high-ambiguity
    environments, moving from ideation to functional code with
    high velocity.
  - Hands-on experience with cloud orchestration (Kubernetes,
    Batch systems) and workflow management tools like Airflow.
  - Technical expertise in building REST APIs, managing database
    systems (ORMs, schemas), and utilizing Infrastructure as
    Code (Terraform).
  - Entrepreneurial mindset with a track record of shipping
    systems in fast-moving, customer-facing environments.
  
  Highly Desired Skills & Experience
  
  - Domain expertise in drug discovery, cheminformatics, or
    advanced materials.
  - Experience delivering scientific code for R&D projects
    involving simulation or numerical optimization.
  - Familiarity with High-Performance Computing (HPC), GPU
    programming, and optimization.
  - Exposure to AI applications involving knowledge graphs, AI
    agents, or multi-agent systems.
  
  Why Join Us?
  
  We offer a comprehensive and competitive benefits package
  designed to support your health, financial well-being, and
  life outside of work.
  
  - Compensation: Competitive base salary, performance-based
    incentives or bonuses (where applicable), and equity
    participation.
  - Benefits: Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage
    for employees and dependents with generous employer
    premium contributions, retirement savings with company
    matching, paid parental leave, and inclusive family-
    building benefits.
  - Work-Life Balance: Flexible paid time off, company-wide
    seasonal breaks, and support for flexible work
    arrangements that enable sustainable performance.
  - Career Development: Opportunities for continuous learning
    and growth through on-the-job development, cross-
    functional collaboration, and access to internal learning
    and development programs.
