description: |
  Garda Capital Partners (Garda) is a multi-billion dollar
  alternative investment firm with over 22 years of experience
  deploying relative value strategies across fixed income
  markets for institutional investors. Garda's primary offices
  are located in Wayzata, New York City, West Palm Beach,
  Geneva, Zug, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Scottsdale.
  
  Garda is looking to hire a Senior Software Engineer (AI
  Tooling) to be a part of our Research and Technology (R&T)
  group to design and build systems that integrate modern AI
  capabilities across the firm. The selected candidate will
  lead technical projects, architect backend infrastructure,
  and create applications that enable research, trading, and
  operations teams to leverage AI tools effectively.
  
  This is a senior engineering role focused on building
  production systems and internal platforms—not ML research or
  model development. You'll design API gateways, build vector
  search infrastructure, create AI-powered internal
  applications, and work with business stakeholders to
  translate requirements into robust technical solutions. The
  ideal candidate is excited about the practical applications
  of AI but wants to focus on software engineering, system
  design, and delivery. Experience in financial services or
  capital markets is strongly preferred.
  
  Position Responsibilities
  
  - Design and lead implementation of backend infrastructure for
    AI capabilities (LLM gateways, vector databases, chat
    services, monitoring systems)
  - Build internal applications that integrate AI into research,
    trading, and operations workflows
  - Architect data processing pipelines and API integrations for
    AI-powered features
  - Own complete projects from design through production
    deployment
  - Evaluate new AI platforms and tools; build proofs-of-concept
    and convert successful ones to production
  - Provide technical consultation to business stakeholders and
    translate their needs into practical solutions
  - Make architectural decisions for systems integrating AI
    capabilities with existing infrastructure
  - Build automation workflows that reduce manual processes
    using AI tools
  - Develop integrations between internal systems, vendor
    platforms, and AI services
  - Establish patterns and best practices for AI application
    development across the firm
  - Mentor other engineers and contribute to technical standards
  - Collaborate with infrastructure and security teams on
    deployment, scaling, and governance
  
  Qualifications & Desired Skills
  
  - Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Engineering,
    Mathematics, Finance, or related field
  - 5+ years of software engineering experience
  - Strong programming skills in Python (primary language) with
    experience in other languages a plus
  - Proven experience designing and building backend services,
    APIs, and internal platforms
  - Experience with cloud platforms, containerization, or
    distributed systems
  - Strong interest in AI applications and modern development
    tools; no ML/deep learning background required
  - Ability to evaluate new technologies, build prototypes, and
    make pragmatic technical decisions
  - Experience with fixed income, trading systems, or investment
    management operations strongly preferred
  - Capital markets knowledge is a significant advantage
  - Excellent problem-solving skills and ability to learn new
    technologies rapidly
  - Strong communication skills with ability to work effectively
    across technical and business teams
  - Self-directed with ability to drive projects independently
    from concept to production
  - Comfortable working in a fast-paced environment with
    evolving requirements
  - Excited about building practical tools that deliver real
    business value
  
  This role is also eligible for other forms of compensation
  and benefits, such as a discretionary bonus, healthcare
  plan, 401(k) matching program, etc. Within the range,
  individual pay is determined by work location and additional
  factors, such as job-related skills, experience, and
  relevant education.

  $200,000—$250,000 USD
