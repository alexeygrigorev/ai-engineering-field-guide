  Senior Backend Engineer, Applied AI
  
  Why Clarium?
  
  Our mission is to accelerate healthcare transformation
  through our AI-powered platform. We strive toward a future
  where hospitals are at the cutting edge of technology,
  operations and efficiency. Healthcare workers are inundated
  with endless tasks, manual processes and often unintuitive
  tools. Clarium is transforming healthcare by empowering
  providers with AI-powered software with intelligent workflow
  automation and actionable insights.
  
  We envision a future where all hospitals leverage our
  collaborative data platform to automate their daily
  operational and administrative tasks, only surfacing high
  complexity issues that truly require their expertise.
  
  We're backed by some of the biggest and most innovative
  investors in the world including: Northzone, General
  Catalyst, AlleyCorp, 1984 Ventures, Alumni Ventures, and
  others.
  
  Role Overview
  
  I'm Dr. Marek Sirendi, Head of AI at Clarium! Since this

  for.

  a Senior Backend Engineer to join our Applied AI team.
  You'll collaborate with engineering, data, and product teams

  with data-driven insights. This is an opportunity to have
  real impact, building systems that directly help healthcare
  providers work more efficiently.

    and FastAPI
  
  - Collaborate with internal product managers and customers to
    align product development with real-world needs
  
  Requirements

  - Understanding of backend architecture principles and AI
    application design best practices
  
  - Experience working with RESTful APIs and integrating third-

  - Strong understanding of database technologies
  
  - Self-motivated with excellent problem-solving and
    communication skills
