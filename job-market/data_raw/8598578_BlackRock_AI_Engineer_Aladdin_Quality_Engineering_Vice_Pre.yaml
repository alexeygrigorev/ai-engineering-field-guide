  About this role
  
  Role Overview: We are looking for a forward-thinking AI
  Engineer to help redefine how quality is understood,
  measured, and improved across our engineering organization.
  This role goes beyond traditional test automation — it
  focuses on building intelligent systems that enhance
  decision-making, accelerate feedback loops, and elevate
  product quality through data-driven insights and adaptive
  tooling. You will work at the intersection of AI, software
  testing, and engineering operations, applying techniques
  from Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing
  (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs) to create scalable
  solutions that support quality assurance, risk analysis, and
  continuous improvement. Key Responsibilities:
  
  - Design and implement AI-driven components that support
    quality engineering across the SDLC.
  - Develop NLP pipelines to extract insights from requirements,
    user feedback, and test artifacts.
  - Fine-tune and deploy LLMs to support intelligent test
    generation, summarization, and anomaly detection.
  - Collaborate with QA, DevOps and Product teams to integrate
    AI tooling into CI/CD pipelines and quality gates.
  - Analyze historical test and defect data to identify patterns
    and optimize regression test coverage.
  - Maintain and improve model performance through continuous
    learning and feedback loops.
  
  Required Skills & Experience:
  
  - Strong proficiency in Python and ML frameworks (e.g.,
    TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn).
  - Hands-on experience with NLP techniques and libraries (e.g.,
    spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers).
  - Proven experience in fine-tuning LLMs for domain-specific
    tasks.
  - Familiarity with software testing methodologies and QA
    lifecycle.
  - Ability to work with structured and unstructured data
    sources.
  - Excellent problem-solving and communication skills.
  
  Preferred Qualifications:
  
  - LLM Expertise: Experience fine-tuning and deploying large
    language models (e.g., GPT, LLaMA) for domain-specific
    tasks such as test case generation, summarization, and
    anomaly detection.
  - Quality Engineering Knowledge: Familiarity with functional
    and regression testing principles, test case design, and
    QA lifecycle.
  - Automation Frameworks: Hands-on experience with tools like
    Selenium, Playwright, or Cypress, and integrating AI into
    these frameworks.
  - MLOps & Deployment: Exposure to MLOps practices including
    model versioning, monitoring, and CI/CD integration using
    platforms like MLflow, Kubeflow, or Azure ML.
  - Cloud & Infrastructure: Experience working with cloud
    platforms (Azure) and containerization tools (Open
    Container Initiative (OCI) container packaging and
    runtime, Cloud-Native distributed containerized
    microservice orchestration) for scalable AI deployment.
  - Data Engineering: Ability to work with large-scale datasets,
    including preprocessing, feature engineering, and data
    pipeline development.
  - Security & Compliance Awareness: Understanding of data
    privacy, model interpretability, and compliance standards
    relevant to AI in enterprise environments.
  - Collaboration & Communication: Proven ability to work cross-
    functionally with QA, DevOps, and product teams, and to
    communicate technical concepts to non-technical
    stakeholders.
  - Exposure to Gherkin syntax and behavior-driven development
    (BDD) practices.
  
  Our benefits To help you stay energized, engaged and
  inspired, we offer a wide range of benefits including a
  strong retirement plan, tuition reimbursement, comprehensive
  healthcare, support for working parents and Flexible Time
