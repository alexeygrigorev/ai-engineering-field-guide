  standards like infrastructure orchestration tools (such as
  Terraform), configuration management tools (like Ansible),
  Cloud software development kits (SDKs). Besides, the
  Engineering team is engaged in initiatives of transforming
  the IT Operations Services suite to be scalable and API-
  capable.
  
  Our Lead Enterprise Cloud Software Developer will work
  closely with other Engineers leveraging a standard set of
  enterprise-wide artifacts such as Design Patterns and
  Standards, follow and establish guiding design principles
  ensuring the develop solutions or technical components
  deliver GBS strategic intent, while meeting the solution
  requirements providing business value.
  
  What You'll Do
  
  - Full-Stack Engineering (Python-first): Design and implement
    resilient services, APIs, and UIs with Python
    (FastAPI/Django/Flask) and modern front-end stacks (e.g.,
    TypeScript/React) where needed; enforce clean
    architecture, SOLID principles, and comprehensive
    unit/integration tests.
  - Cloud Programmability: Build automation and platform
    capabilities using Azure and AWS SDKs (e.g., azure-sdk-
    for-python, boto3), event-driven designs, serverless
    functions, and service APIs to standardize and accelerate
    cloud operations.
  - AI for Developers: use AI assistants for code and test
    generation, defect pattern analysis, code optimization,
    and documentation; Integrate LLM-powered features safely;
    apply prompt engineering and evaluation; follow MLOps
    basics for model usage in applications.
  - Infrastructure as Code & DevOps: Author Terraform modules
    and CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps/GitLab) to deliver
    hands-free deployments, policy-as-code, and repeatable
    environments.
  - Performance, Scalability, and Reliability: Profile and
    optimize code paths; apply caching, asynchronous I/O,
    connection pooling, efficient data models, and resource
    tuning; design for horizontal scale and graceful
    degradation; instrument services with APM/observability.
  - Secure SDLC and Compliance: Practice threat modeling, secure
    coding, secret management, dependency hygiene, and code
    reviews; align with security champions and audit
    requirements.
  - Quality Engineering: Define DoR/DoD, implement automated
    tests (unit, integration, performance, security), and
    continuously improve engineering practices.
  - Architecture & Patterns: Apply industry-standard patterns
    (e.g., hexagonal architecture, CQRS where appropriate,
    pub/sub, idempotency) for reusability and maintainability;
    contribute to and consume enterprise design standards.
  - Data & APIs: Design contract-first REST/GraphQL APIs; model
    relational and NoSQL data for correctness and performance;
    implement pagination, filtering, and rate-limiting.
  - Collaboration & Documentation: Produce technical
    specifications, C4 model diagrams for C1–C3, and
    knowledge-base content; communicate status, risks, and
    trade-offs to stakeholders.
  - Craft a culture of execution excellence coupled with
    innovation by incorporating best of the breed toolset
  - Partner closely with Architecture and Engineering, Cloud
    Operations and Security teams to ensure the
    operationalization and adoption of engineering work.
