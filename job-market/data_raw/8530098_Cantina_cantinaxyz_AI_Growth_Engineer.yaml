  About Spearbit & Cantina:
  
  Founded in 2021 by former Ethereum Foundation Solidity
  engineers, Spearbit tackles Web3 security challenges. Our
  founding team built the leading blockchain language and
  secured the largest smart contract, protecting over $160B in
  value.
  
  We're building Cantina —the "GitHub for Security"—connecting
  security researchers with projects needing expertise. Our
  Cantina security platform has powered major competitions and
  serves the leading projects in Web 3. It currently supports
  collaborative security reviews, public and private security
  competitions, bug bounty programs, incident response, and AI
  code analyzer.
  
  Similar to how cloud-security startups emerged previously,
  Cantina aims to be the definitive code-security platform for
  the future.
  
  The Opportunity:
  
  We’re hiring an AI Marketing / GTM Engineer to architect and
  own the technical engine behind our growth.
  
  This is not a traditional marketer role. It’s not a
  traditional engineer role. It’s a hybrid builder position
  for someone who understands that modern go-to-market is a
  systems problem.
  
  You’ll design and deploy AI agents, automation workflows,
  data pipelines, and growth infrastructure that:
  
  - Generate and qualify pipeline
  - Power intelligent outbound and inbound motion
  - Automate multi-step marketing campaigns
  - Surface high-intent prospects from data
  - Build and scale Cantina’s AI-native marketing automation
    engine
  - Turn fragmented marketing tools into a cohesive acquisition
    and campaign system
  
  You will own the architecture behind how Cantina attracts,
  scores, nurtures, and converts customers. This role focuses
  on acquisition and marketing automation systems, not
  company-wide BI or internal operations infrastructure.
  
  If you think in systems, build in code, and obsess over
  leverage - this role is for you.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Optimize Cantina’s marketing website (performance, SEO, AEO,
    conversion architecture).
  - Build AI agents that run continuously to identify, enrich,
    and qualify prospects.
  - Design automated lead-generation systems.
  - Architect marketing automation infrastructure that
    orchestrates multi-channel campaigns (email, social,
    community, paid, etc.).
  - Build lead scoring, segmentation, and routing pipelines
    using Python, Typescript, SQL, and modern data tooling.
  - Ensure clean, structured marketing data flows into the CRM
    and downstream systems without owning company-wide
    analytics infrastructure.
  - Develop monitoring systems that detect market events
    (exploits, launches, governance proposals, funding rounds)
    and trigger contextual outreach.
  - Help build AI-driven content systems (LLM workflows,
    structured prompt pipelines, retrieval systems).
  - Implement marketing performance tracking and campaign
    attribution systems within the marketing automation stack.
  
  Requirements:
  
  - 3+ years working with AI systems (LLMs, embeddings, RAG,
    agent orchestration, prompt engineering).
  - Strong proficiency in Python, TypeScript, and SQL.
  - Experience building scalable data pipelines and ETL systems.
  - Hands-on experience with LLM APIs, AI agents, prompt
    engineering, and RAG systems.
  - Proven experience building automated data collection systems
    (web scraping, API integrations, monitoring systems).
  - Experience integrating marketing technology stacks (HubSpot,
    Salesforce, analytics tools, ad platforms).
  - Strong understanding of database design, data modeling, and
    system architecture.
  - Familiarity with AWS/GCP/Azure and modern deployment
    workflows.
  - Comfort working with non-technical stakeholders to ship
    user-friendly systems.
  - A metrics-driven, ROI-focused mindset.
  - Must be willing to work on-site in our NYC office a few days
    per week.
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Experience in B2B SaaS GTM infrastructure.
  - Experience building growth engines in fast-scaling startups.
  - Knowledge of data privacy, compliance, and responsible
    automation practices.
  - Familiarity with agent frameworks (AgentSDK, LangChain,
    ReAct, tool-based agents).
  - Background in Web3 or security infrastructure.
  - Entrepreneurial mindset with strong ownership instincts.
  
  You'll Thrive If:
  
  - You see acquisition and marketing automation as an
    engineering discipline.
  - You get excited about eliminating manual processes.
  - You prefer building systems over running playbooks.
  - You move fast, ship often, and iterate relentlessly.
  - You care about measurable impact over vanity metrics.
  
  Benefits
  
  - Competitive salary and performance-based compensation
    opportunities
  - Opportunity to work in an early-stage startup with a
    talented and passionate team.
  - Exposure to high-profile clients in the blockchain and
    cryptocurrency industry
  - Comprehensive health benefit plans
  - 401k matching program
