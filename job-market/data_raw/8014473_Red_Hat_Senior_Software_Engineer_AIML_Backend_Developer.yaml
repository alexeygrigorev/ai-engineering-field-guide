  in accordance with Red Hat policies and applicable privacy
  laws.
  
  At Red Hat, our commitment to open source innovation extends
  beyond our products - it’s embedded in how we work and grow.
  Red Hatters embrace change – especially in our fast-moving
  technological landscape – and have a strong growth mindset.
  That's why we encourage our teams to proactively,
  thoughtfully, and ethically use AI to simplify their
  workflows, cut complexity, and boost efficiency. This
  empowers our associates to focus on higher-impact work,
  creating smart, more innovative solutions that solve our
  customers' most pressing challenges.

  - Platform Development: Design, architect, document, and lead
    the development of AI/ML platform components and agentic
    AI applications.
  - Coding & Implementation: Implement and optimize cutting-edge
    AI/ML algorithms and production-quality code, primarily
    using Python and possibly Go, C, C++, or Rust.
  - AI-assisted development: Proactively utilize AI-assisted
    development tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude
    Code) for code generation, auto-completion, and
    intelligent suggestions to accelerate development cycles
    and enhance code quality.
  - Open Source Contribution: Participate in and contribute to
    relevant upstream communities such as Kubeflow, vLLM, TGI,
    and PyTorch, ensuring technologies integrate well with Red
    Hat products.
  - Deployment & Operations: Build and deploy container-based
    applications to platforms like Red Hat OpenShift, public
    clouds (AWS, GCP, Azure), leveraging CI/CD best practices
    and MLOps infrastructure.
  - Collaboration & Mentorship: Work closely with research
    scientists, data scientists, product teams, and
    stakeholders. Mentor and guide junior engineers and share
    knowledge within the team.
  - Innovation & Troubleshooting: Stay current with advancements
    in Generative AI and related technologies, conduct root
    cause analysis, and solve complex problems in a dynamic
    environment.
  
  What you will bring:
  
  - Experience: Typically requires 5+ years of software
    development experience with a background in computer
    science or a related technical field.
  - Programming Languages: Strong proficiency in Python is
    essential, with experience in frameworks like LangChain,
    LangGraph, or PyTorch.
  - Technologies:
    - Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).
    - Red Hat OpenShift Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).
    - Public cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure).
    - CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab).
    - Model inference runtimes and optimization (vLLM, TGI).
    - Understanding of web application infrastructure, REST, and
      HTTP.
