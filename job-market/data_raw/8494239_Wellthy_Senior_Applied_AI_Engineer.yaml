  Why Wellthy is for you!
  
  At Wellthy, we dream of a world where everyone has the care
  infrastructure they need to manage their own health and the
  health and well-being of their loved ones. We’re building
  something new in the care space - reimagining how care is
  delivered, accessed, and supported by families around the
  globe. As we grow, we’re seeking collaborative, curious, and
  purpose-driven teammates to help us expand what’s possible.
  Our work is grounded in the expertise of seasoned care
  professionals who deeply understand families’ real
  challenges paired with agile, tech-powered solutions that
  deliver support efficiently and at scale. We embrace a
  mindset of continuous learning, especially around emerging
  technologies. Tools like AI and other innovations are
  accelerators, enabling us to scale our impact, work smarter,
  and stay at the forefront of care delivery.
  
  Through Wellthy, millions of families have access to support
  to help them manage care during every stage of life, with
  hands-on experts guiding families through caregiving or
  backup care journeys. And with the acquisition of Patch
  Caregiving, Wellthy continues to expand how care shows up
  for working families by pairing care navigation and
  coordination with on-site and near-site employer-based
  childcare. This combination allows us to support families
  not just in navigating care decisions, but in accessing
  real, hands-on help when and where they need it most.
  Together, we’re building a more connected, comprehensive
  care experience for families and caregivers alike.
  
  We partner with leading companies including more than 40
  Fortune 500 companies to support the care needs of their
  workforces globally. We also work alongside health plans and
  carriers to embed care support into their offerings,
  enhancing the experience and outcomes for members. We’re
  building, evolving, and expanding the market category for
  care, and we’re looking for responsive, collaborative,
  curious, and purposeful colleagues to join us.
