  About Anthropic
  
  Anthropic’s mission is to create reliable, interpretable,
  and steerable AI systems. We want AI to be safe and
  beneficial for our users and for society as a whole. Our
  team is a quickly growing group of committed researchers,
  engineers, policy experts, and business leaders working
  together to build beneficial AI systems.
  
  About the Role
  
  AIRE (AI Reliability Engineering) partners with teams across
  Anthropic to improve reliability across our most critical
  serving paths -- every hop from the SDK through our network,
  API layers, serving infrastructure, and accelerators and
  back. We jump into the trenches alongside partner teams to
  make the systems that deliver Claude more robust and
  resilient, be it during an incident or collaborating on
  projects.
  
  Reliability here is an emergent phenomenon that transcends
  any single team's boundaries, so someone has to zoom out and
  look at the whole picture. That's us -- and it means few
  teams at Anthropic offer this kind of dynamic, cross-cutting
  exposure to the systems that matter most.
  
  Claude has your back. AIRE has Claude's. Help us keep Claude
  reliable for everyone who depends on it.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Develop appropriate Service Level Objectives for large
    language model serving systems, balancing availability and
    latency with development velocity.
  - Design and implement monitoring and observability systems
    across the token path.
  - Assist in the design and implementation of high-availability
    serving infrastructure across multiple regions and cloud
    providers
  - Lead incident response for critical AI services, ensuring
    rapid recovery, thorough incident reviews, and systematic
    improvements.
  - Support the reliability of safeguard model serving --
    critical for both site reliability and Anthropic's safety
    commitments.
  
  You may be a good fit if you:
  
  - Have strong distributed systems, infrastructure, or
    reliability backgrounds -- we're looking for reliability-
    minded software engineers and SREs.
  - Are curious and brave -- comfortable jumping into unfamiliar
    systems during an incident and helping drive resolution
    even when you don't have deep expertise yet.
  - Think holistically about how systems compose and where the
    seams are.
  - Can build lasting relationships across teams -- our
    engagement model depends on being welcomed as teammates,
    not outsiders with opinions.
  - Care about users and feel ownership over outcomes, even for
    systems you don't own.
  - Have excellent communication and collaboration skills --
    you'll be partnering across the entire company.
  - Bring diverse experience -- the team's strength comes from
    people who've built product stacks, scaled databases, run
    massive distributed systems, and everything in between.
  
  Strong candidates may also:
  
  - Have been an SRE, Production Engineer, or in similar
    reliability-focused roles on large scale systems
  - Have experience operating large-scale model serving or
    training infrastructure (>1000 GPUs).
  - Have experience with one or more ML hardware accelerators
    (GPUs, TPUs, Trainium).
  - Understand ML-specific networking optimizations like RDMA
    and InfiniBand.
  - Have expertise in AI-specific observability tools and
    frameworks.
  - Have experience with chaos engineering and systematic
    resilience testing.
  - Have contributed to open-source infrastructure or ML
    tooling.
  
  The annual compensation range for this role is listed below.
  
  For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target
  Earnings ("OTE") range, meaning that the range includes both
  the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base
  salary for the role.
  
  Annual Salary:
  
  $325,000—$485,000 USD

  Education requirements: We require at least a Bachelor's
  degree in a related field or equivalent experience.
  Location-based hybrid policy: Currently, we expect all staff
  to be in one of our offices at least 25% of the time.
  However, some roles may require more time in our offices.
  
  Visa sponsorship: We do sponsor visas! However, we aren't
  able to successfully sponsor visas for every role and every
  candidate. But if we make you an offer, we will make every
  reasonable effort to get you a visa, and we retain an
  immigration lawyer to help with this.
  
  We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you
  meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates
  will meet every single qualification as listed.  Research
  shows that people who identify as being from
  underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing
  imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their
  candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself
  prematurely and to submit an application if you're
  interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones
  we're building have enormous social and ethical
  implications. We think this makes representation even more
  important, and we strive to include a range of diverse
  perspectives on our team. Your safety matters to us. To
  protect yourself from potential scams, remember that
  Anthropic recruiters only contact you from @anthropic.com
  email addresses. In some cases, we may partner with vetted
  recruiting agencies who will identify themselves as working
  on behalf of Anthropic. Be cautious of emails from other
  domains. Legitimate Anthropic recruiters will never ask for
  money, fees, or banking information before your first day.

  position openings.
  
  How we're different
  
  We believe that the highest-impact AI research will be big
  science. At Anthropic we work as a single cohesive team on
  just a few large-scale research efforts. And we value impact
  — advancing our long-term goals of steerable, trustworthy AI
  — rather than work on smaller and more specific puzzles. We
  view AI research as an empirical science, which has as much
  in common with physics and biology as with traditional
  efforts in computer science. We're an extremely
  collaborative group, and we host frequent research
  discussions to ensure that we are pursuing the highest-
  impact work at any given time. As such, we greatly value
  communication skills.
  
  The easiest way to understand our research directions is to
  read our recent research. This research continues many of
  the directions our team worked on prior to Anthropic,
  including: GPT-3, Circuit-Based Interpretability, Multimodal
  Neurons, Scaling Laws, AI & Compute, Concrete Problems in AI
  Safety, and Learning from Human Preferences.
  
  Come work with us!
  
  Anthropic is a public benefit corporation headquartered in
