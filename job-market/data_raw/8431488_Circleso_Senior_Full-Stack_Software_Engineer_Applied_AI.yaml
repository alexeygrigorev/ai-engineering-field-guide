  About Us
  
  Circle is building the world’s leading all-in-one platform
  for online communities. We make it possible for creators,
  coaches, educators, and businesses to bring together their
  audience with engaging discussions, live streams, events,
  chat, courses, and payments — all in one place, all under
  their own brand.
  
  We’re proud to be a fully remote company of around 200 (and
  growing!) team members from 30+ countries around the world.
  We seek exceptional individuals around the world, set them
  up to do the best work of their lives, and in turn, create a
  meaningful impact in their own lives. We don't track hours,
  but we do manage for high expectations very closely. We
  collaborate across time zones, are highly async, and like to
  document a lot.
  
  Twice a year, we bring the whole company together in
  beautiful places around the world for our company offsites.
  So far, we’ve hosted offsites in Turkey, Portugal, Mexico,
  Thailand, Colombia, Italy, Ireland, and more, with still
  more to come!

  About the role
  
  The Applied AI team at Circle is at the forefront of
  leveraging AI to drive innovation for our customers through
  transformative applications of large language models (LLMs).
  
  We're looking for a strong full-stack engineer who is
  proficient in web frameworks, backend development, and
  infrastructure to spearhead the development of full-stack AI
  solutions across Circle. You will work on exciting projects
  such as AI agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, AI
  evaluations and observability, and building infrastructure
  for LLM inference.
  
  While deep AI specialization or expertise isn't required, we
  care about hands-on experience building AI features. Beyond
  that, we’re looking for a strong experimentation mindset. If
  you're excited about rapidly testing ideas, running A/B
  experiments, and iterating on real production use cases of
  LLMs, this role is for you.
  
  The Applied AI team is composed of different backgrounds.
  Some team members joined with deep Rails experience and
  solid AI fundamentals, while other team members joined with
  deep AI experience and ramped up on Rails. Either path works
  as long as you bring hands-on experience with both Rails and
  AI, and have genuine curiosity to grow.
  
  What you'll be doing
  
  - Ship full-stack AI projects end-to-end on a product built in
    Ruby on Rails backend and React frontend.
  - Design and run experiments (including A/B tests, AI
    evaluations, or others) to validate AI features, measure
    impact, and guide iteration.
  - Build and integrate components for AI infrastructure and
    optimize them for performance and reliability to support
    production-level inferencing.
  - Improve processes, tools, and systems to scale AI features
    into production-ready solutions.
  - Help us stay up-to-date with the cutting-edge AI research,
    techniques, and tools.
  - Work closely with Circle's leaders and designers throughout
    the feature design process.
  - Foster a bias for action by prioritizing speed of iteration,
    experimentation, and learning, while maintaining high
    standards of code quality and user experience.
  
  What you'll need to be successful
  
  - 6+ years experience working as a full-stack engineer on
    high-traffic production applications. You've dealt with
    the challenges that come with scale — query optimization,
    careful migrations, performance bottlenecks.
  - Strong proficiency in Ruby on Rails, MySQL / Postgresql,
    ReactJS. Familiarity with both frontend and backend is
    necessary, but a high degree of proficiency in both is not
    a requirement.
  - Hands-on experience building AI features in production —
    whether RAG systems, AI agents, or LLM-powered tools.
    You've shipped at least one real AI use case, not just
    prototypes.
  - Strong experimentation mindset — you’re comfortable
    designing and running A/B tests, measuring results, and
    iterating quickly to discover what works and what doesn’t.
  - A desire to work in an environment which values speed of
    iteration and individual autonomy, while also embracing
    personal accountability and the ability to collaborate
    effectively as part of a dynamic team.
  - Comfortable in a fast-paced environment with a certain level
    of ambiguity, especially when learning and picking up new
    technologies when projects require it.
  - Strong alignment with our values, find our values on our
    career page if you haven’t read up on them yet.
  - You are proficient in English (spoken, written, and reading)
    at a CEFR Level C2 / ILR Level 5.
  
  $130,000 - $140,000 USD per year
  
  The cash compensation range shown is a starting point. In
  addition to equity, benefits and perks, your cash
  compensation is subject to an annual review and increase on
  a once per year basis.
  
  The fun stuff
  
  - Fully remote: work from anywhere in the world!
  - Autonomy and trust to do your job: we care about outcomes
    over everything else.
  - Paid time away: all employees are given 35 days of PTO
    annually. We also offer a paid sabbatical after 5 years.
  - Generous U.S. benchmarked compensation and startup equity no
    matter where you are in the world.*
  - Awesome medical coverage with 100% coverage for you and your
    family, or medical reimbursement options where
    applicable!*
  - Parental leave for parents expanding their family, or just
    starting one.
  - Home office stipend to help you get up and running.
  - Learning & development stipend to help you level up your
    professional skills.
  - Annual bonus potential for roles that don't already receive
    variable income or commission.
  - Company retreats: Twice a year, the Circle team gets
    together for a fully paid company retreat in incredible
    places around the world! We’ve had past retreats in
    Colombia, Portugal, and Mexico, with more planned on the
    horizon.
