  Job Title:
  
  Senior Applied AI Engineer
  
  Company:
  
  Prologis
  
  A day in the life
  
  In this role, you will explore and experiment with emerging
  AI techniques to establish new and evolve existing
  enterprise AI patterns. Your time will be spent designing
  and running hypothesis-driven pilots, evaluating results,
  and translating learnings into clear recommendations,
  reference architectures and next steps. You will collaborate
  closely with AI platform and delivery teams to transition
  successful approaches into scalable architectures. Along the
  way, you’ll communicate findings through demos and concise
  readouts that connect technical outcomes to business impact.
  
  Key Responsibilities:
  
  • Drive AI innovation and rapid experimentation to advance
  Prologis capabilities (agentic workflows, reasoning
  approaches, evaluation methods, and emerging techniques).
  
  • Design and execute timeboxed pilots with clear hypotheses,
  success metrics, and kill/scale decision points.
  
  • Enhance and evolve existing enterprise AI patterns and
  standards (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation, text-to-
  SQL, evaluation/observability, guardrails) using new
  approaches and measured outcomes.
  
  • Build reference implementations and handoff documents so
  successful experiments transition into scalable
  architectures in partnership with the Central AI team.
  
  • Develop within the AWS ecosystem using secure, observable,
  cost-aware architectures and strong software engineering
  practices.
  
  • Communicate results through demos and concise readouts
  that connect technical outcomes to business value,
  tradeoffs, and recommended next steps.
  
  • Support priority project work as cycles allow, focused on
  de-risking and acceleration with clear entry/exit criteria.
  
  • Continuously evaluate emerging AI tools, frameworks, and
  vendor offerings; synthesize external research, OSS trends,
  and vendor capabilities into actionable recommendations for
  Prologis.
  
  Required Qualifications:
  
  • 8+ years of software engineering experience (or
  equivalent), delivering production-quality systems.
  
  • Expert Python skills (clean architecture, testing,
  packaging, performance and reliability).
  
  • Strong AWS architecture and development experience
  (security/IAM, networking, serverless and/or containers,
  monitoring/logging, cost controls).
  
  • Strong data foundations: SQL, data modeling,
  APIs/integration patterns; comfortable incorporating RAG and
  text-to-SQL patterns into real solutions.
  
  • Demonstrated rigor in experimentation: hypothesis-driven
  approach, evaluation plans, metrics, timeboxing, and
  pragmatic decision-making.
  
  • Ability to communicate clearly to both technical and
  business stakeholders; proven storytelling and influence
  through results.
  
  • Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science/Engineering (or
  equivalent practical experience).
  
  • Hands-on experience designing and interpreting LLM
  evaluations (task success, faithfulness, hallucination
  analysis, cost/latency tradeoffs).
  
  • Familiarity with modern LLM application stacks across
  vendors, with an ability to reason about abstraction
  tradeoffs, portability, and long-term maintainability.
  
  • Hands-on experience with agentic systems (tool use, memory
  strategies, multi-agent orchestration) and
  reliability/evaluation techniques.
  
  Preferred Qualifications:
  
  • Experience with Dataiku (DSS), including building and
  operationalizing analytics/AI workflows; LLMOps experience
  is a plus.
  
  • Experience building evaluation harnesses (golden sets,
  regression testing, error analysis) and partnering on
  risk/safety reviews.
  
  • Exposure to OpenAI AgentKit/ChatKit and Apps SDK/MCP is a
  plus.
  
  • Experience transitioning prototypes into enterprise-ready
  patterns in partnership with platform and delivery teams.
  
  Hiring Salary Range of: $125,000 - $186,000. Salary and
  whole compensation package (bonus target) to be determined
  by the candidate’s location, education, experience,
  knowledge, skills, and abilities, as well as internal equity
  and alignment with market data.
