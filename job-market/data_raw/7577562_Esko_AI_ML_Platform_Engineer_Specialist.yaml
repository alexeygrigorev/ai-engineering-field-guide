  scalable, reliable, and automated AI development through a
  modern MLOps platform—primarily on AWS, but adaptable across
  multi-cloud environments.
  
  The ideal candidate combines deep software and platform
  engineering expertise with strong knowledge of MLOps
  practices and AI/LLM ecosystem tooling. You will partner
  closely with data science, AI, and product engineering teams
  to accelerate model delivery and operational excellence
  through infrastructure, tooling, and platform services. Role
  is Hybrid and its preferable to have incumbent based in
  Bangalore.
  
  In this role, a typical day will look like:
  
  - Develop, improve, and maintain the MLOps platform to enable
    scalable, reproducible, and observable machine learning
    and generative AI workflows.
  - Design and operate core ML infrastructure (feature stores,
    model registries, CI/CD pipelines, and data pipelines)
    using AWS services such as SageMaker, ECS/EKS, Lambda, and
    Step Functions.
  - Enable and support AI and ML development teams, providing
    best practices, tooling, and technical guidance on
    leveraging the platform for training, fine-tuning, and
    deployment.
  - Drive technology and architecture decisions across the ML
    stack, including frameworks, data processing,
    orchestration, and monitoring tools.
  - Collaborate with AI engineering teams to integrate LLMs and
    generative AI capabilities into products through
    standardized, secure, and auditable infrastructure.
  - Ensure platform scalability, reliability, and compliance by
    applying DevOps, infrastructure-as-code (IaC), and
    observability best practices.
  - Continuously evaluate and integrate emerging technologies
    (e.g., LangChain, Ray, MLflow, Kubeflow, Hugging Face) to
    enhance developer productivity and operational efficiency.
  
  Required Skills & Qualifications
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Software
    Engineering, or related field.
  - 4+ years of experience in ML/AI platform or infrastructure
    engineering, preferably in enterprise or SaaS
    environments.
  - Strong experience with AWS cloud services (SageMaker,
    ECS/EKS, S3, CloudFormation/Terraform, Step Functions,
    Lambda).
  - Expertise in MLOps frameworks and tools (MLflow, Kubeflow,
    Vertex AI, Azure ML, or equivalent).
  - Solid software engineering background with proficiency in
    Python, containerization (Docker), and Kubernetes
    orchestration.
  - Proven ability to design and operate scalable data and ML
    infrastructure with a focus on automation, observability,
    and governance.
  - Familiarity with vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone,
    Weaviate) and LLM infrastructure (RAG, prompt
    orchestration, model serving).
  - Understanding of security, access control, and compliance in
    AI/ML environments.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Experience implementing CT/CD (Continuous Training and
    Deployment) pipelines and feature stores.
  - Familiarity with multi-cloud MLOps or hybrid environments.
  - Exposure to LLM and agentic frameworks (LangChain,
    LlamaIndex, Semantic Kernel).
  - Experience with IaC and DevOps automation (Terraform, CDK,
    GitHub Actions, Argo).
  - Background in platform enablement, building internal tools
    or SDKs for ML practitioners.
  - Contributions to open-source or internal platform frameworks
    related to AI/ML.
