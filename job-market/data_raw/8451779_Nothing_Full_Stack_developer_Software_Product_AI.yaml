  About Nothing
  
  Nothing exists to make tech feel exciting again.
  
  We’re building a different kind of technology company, one
  that puts design, emotion, and human creativity at the heart
  of everything we do. From the way our products look and feel
  to how we communicate and show up in culture, we believe
  technology should make you feel something.
  
  Founded in London in 2020, we’ve grown from idea to global
  challenger in just a few years. Backed by GV (Google
  Ventures), EQT Ventures, and C Ventures, and investors like
  Tony Fadell (iPod), Casey Neistat, and Kevin Lin (Twitch),
  we’re now sold in 40+ markets with millions of users
  worldwide.
  
  About the Team
  
  The AI & Services team is where we stop improving existing
  things and start inventing what’s missing. We are the studio
  within the machine, tasked with exploring the bleeding edge
  of human-computer interaction. We don't just build websites;
  we build intelligence that feels alive. We are working to
  make tech feel less like a tool and more like a companion.
  This is a space for high-speed experimentation, where we
  prototype relentlessly to find the "magic" before scaling it
  to millions of users globally. If you want to build the
  future of how people talk to their devices, this is where it
  happens.
  
  What You'll Do
  
  - Rapidly prototype and ship novel AI interfaces—from chat and
    voice to multi-modal interactions—that define the next
    generation of the Nothing OS experience.
  - Translate wild, experimental concepts into robust,
    production-grade full-stack applications using Next.js,
    React, and Node/Python.
  - Optimise the "feel" of AI; you will obsess over latency,
    real-time performance, and the micro-interactions that
    make a digital assistant feel responsive and human.
  - Define and architect the underlying patterns and frameworks
    that power our AI service layer, ensuring our experimental
    code can scale to a global user base.
  - Work directly with hardware and OS teams to blur the lines
    between web, mobile, and embedded surfaces, creating a
    seamless continuity across devices.
  - Collaborate with Product Designers to invent entirely new
    interaction models, moving beyond the traditional screen-
    tap paradigm.
  - Manage your own deployment pipelines and infrastructure
    choices, ensuring we maintain a high velocity of shipping
    without breaking production.
  
  What We're Looking For
  
  - Deep Product Pragmatism: You have a bias toward shipping.
    You understand that a working prototype in a user's hands
    is worth infinitely more than perfect code on your local
    machine.
  - Technical Excellence: You bring battle-hardened experience
    with React and Next.js, backed by strong backend skills in
    Node.js or Python. You know your way around microservices
    and cloud-native infrastructure.
  - A Drive to Own It: You are comfortable working in ambiguity.
    You don't wait for a ticket to be defined; you see the
    goal, grab the necessary API keys, and build the solution.
  - AI Fluency: You have hands-on experience or a deep curiosity
    for APIs, MCPs, LLMs, and vector databases. You understand
    the unique constraints of building with non-deterministic
    models.
  - Design Sensibility: You care deeply about how things look
    and feel. You understand that in consumer tech, the
    quality of the animation is just as important as the
    quality of the algorithm.
  - Cross-Platform Mindset: You can think outside the browser,
    understanding how web technologies can drive experiences
    on mobile and embedded systems.
  - Curiosity: You are constantly playing with new tools (RAG
    systems, agents) not because you have to, but because you
    want to see what they can do.
  
  How We Work
  
  We build better tech by moving fast. That speed demands
  direct collaboration and shared creative energy. We believe
  the best work happens when we're together.
  
  - Location: London (Kings Cross & Farringdon offices).
  - Working Pattern: This is a full-time, in-office role (5 days
    a week). We move fast, and that means being physically
    present. We design flexibility around personal needs, but
    we focus on the magic that sparks when we’re all in the
    same room.
  - Commute: We ask that you live within a 60-minute commute of
    your home office location.
