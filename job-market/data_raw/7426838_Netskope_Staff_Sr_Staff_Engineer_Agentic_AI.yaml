  About Netskope
  
  Today, there's more data and users outside the enterprise
  than inside, causing the network perimeter as we know it to
  dissolve. We realized a new perimeter was needed, one that
  is built in the cloud and follows and protects data wherever
  it goes, so we started Netskope to redefine Cloud, Network
  and Data Security.
  
  Since 2012, we have built the market-leading cloud security
  company and an award-winning culture powered by hundreds of
  employees spread across offices in Santa Clara, St. Louis,
  Bangalore, London, Paris, Melbourne, Taipei, and Tokyo. Our
  core values are openness, honesty, and transparency, and we
  purposely developed our open desk layouts and large meeting
  spaces to support and promote partnerships, collaboration,
  and teamwork. From catered lunches and office celebrations
  to employee recognition events and social professional
  groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we
  strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.  Visit
  us at Netskope Careers. Please follow us on LinkedIn and
  Twitter@Netskope.
