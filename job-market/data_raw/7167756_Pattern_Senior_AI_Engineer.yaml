  About the Team
  
  We’re a builder team at Pattern that ships products to
  streamline operations and open new markets. We move quickly,
  iterate directly with users, and give engineers real
  autonomy and ownership. AI is part of our daily toolkit—used
  to speed up product management, elevate experience design,
  and increase engineering velocity. We share what works and
  continually raise the bar together.
  
  The Role
  
  - We’re looking for a Senior Software Engineer who enjoys
    building innovative, scalable solutions for ambiguous
    problems. You’ll work across the stack, collaborate with
    product and design, and own projects from architecture
    through launch and iteration.

  - Marketplace Content Optimization at Scale -Synthesize/enrich
    product listings, normalize attributes and taxonomies, and
    enable rapid experimentation to improve conversion.
  - Applied Automation & Robotics Enablement - Connect
    perception, workflow orchestration, and operator tools to
    improve reliability and throughput in physical operations.
  - AI Platform & Agentic Workflows - Retrieval, evaluation,
    guardrails, and observability services that integrate AI
    deeply into product experiences with the right
    cost/latency/quality trade-offs.
  
  Our Preferred Stack
  
  - We hire senior engineering ability and adaptability. If
    you’re willing to adopt our tools, we want to talk—even if
    your background differs.
  - Languages & Frameworks: Python, FastAPI, React/Next.js(Good
    to know)
  - Cloud & Infrastructure: AWS (Terraform (Good to know))
  - Data: SQL
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  - Design, build, and operate production systems with clear
    interfaces, tests, and observability.
  - Partner directly with users and stakeholders to validate
    value and iterate quickly.
  - Apply AI thoughtfully to accelerate development and improve
    outcomes, and share your approach with the team.
  - Make pragmatic architecture decisions and own projects end-
    to-end.
  
  What We’re Looking For
  
  - Senior-level experience delivering and operating production
    software (typically 4+ years).
  - Strong backend skills (APIs, data modeling, cloud services)
    and comfort working across the stack.
  - Product mindset: bias to action, care for UX, reliability,
    and maintainability.
  - Curiosity and sound judgment in applying AI to real
    workflows.
