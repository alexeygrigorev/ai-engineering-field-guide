  About the Team The AI Center of Excellence leverages
  advanced machine learning, LLMs, and agentic systems to
  enhance threat detection and automate security workflows for
  our global customers. We transform 20+ years of threat
  intelligence into proactive defense features through a
  collaborative, research-driven engineering environment.
  About the Role
  
  - As a Data Scientist (SE-2), your primary responsibility will
    be to contribute to the end-to-end development,
    evaluation, and monitoring of ML and LLM-based security
    features.
  - Execute data acquisition, cleaning, and feature engineering
    to prepare high-quality datasets for security modeling.
  - Build and evaluate supervised and unsupervised ML models,
    including classification, clustering, and anomaly
    detection.
  - Develop and optimize LLM-based workflows, including prompt
    engineering and the implementation of RAG pipelines.
  - Support the deployment and observability of models on AWS
    infrastructure using established CI/CD pipelines.
  
  The skills and qualities you'll bring include:
  
  - A courageous and curious mindset, demonstrating a strong
    ability to learn new technologies and operate in ambiguous
    problem spaces.
  - Exceptional collaboration skills with the ability to work
    cross-functionally with senior scientists and engineers to
    ship production features.
  - Strong ownership and principled decision-making when
    evaluating model performance and data quality.
  - 2-5 years of professional experience in Data Science or ML
    Engineering roles.
  - Proficiency in Python and its scientific ecosystem,
    specifically Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
  - Hands-on experience building and tuning supervised and
    unsupervised machine learning models.
  - Working knowledge of AWS ML services, including SageMaker,
    S3, Bedrock, and Lambda.
  - Foundational exposure to LLM orchestration frameworks such
    as LangChain or HuggingFace Transformers.
  - Understanding of deep learning frameworks (PyTorch or
    TensorFlow) for NLP or sequence-based problems.
  - Familiarity with model evaluation metrics and explainability
    techniques like SHAP or LIME.
  - Basic understanding of CI/CD pipelines (GitHub
    Actions/Jenkins) and version control for ML workloads.
  - Experience monitoring model performance and drift using
    tools like CloudWatch.
