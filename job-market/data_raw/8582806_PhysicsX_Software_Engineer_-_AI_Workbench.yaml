  About us
  
  PhysicsX is a deep-tech company with roots in numerical
  physics and Formula One, dedicated to accelerating hardware
  innovation at the speed of software.
  
  We are building an AI-driven simulation software stack for
  engineering and manufacturing across advanced industries. By
  enabling high-fidelity, multi-physics simulation through AI
  inference across the entire engineering lifecycle, PhysicsX
  unlocks new levels of optimization and automation in design,
  manufacturing, and operations — empowering engineers to push
  the boundaries of possibility. Our customers include leading
  innovators in Aerospace & Defense, Materials, Energy,
  Semiconductors, and Automotive.
  
  The Role
  
  PhysicsX is developing a platform used by Data Scientists
  and Simulation Engineers to build, train, and deploy Deep
  Physics Models. The core of this platform relies on handling
  massive volumes of complex simulation data, enabling high-
  fidelity multi-physics simulation through AI inference.
  
  We are looking for a Software Engineer with a strong
  background in building data platforms to join our team. You
  will not just be moving data from A to B; you will be
  architecting and building the distributed systems, services,
  and APIs that form the backbone of our data strategy. You
  will bridge the gap between complex physical simulations and
  modern data infrastructure, implementing storage solutions
  for AI/ML pipelines and creating the analytical layers that
  allow our engineers to visualise and understand their
  results.
  
  You will also play a key role in shaping technical direction
  — contributing to Technical Decision Records, collaborating
  with experienced engineers, and helping to drive the
  standards that keep our platform reliable, secure, and
  performant. This is a role for a builder who loves coding
  robust software as much as they love designing efficient
  data architectures.
  
  What you will do
  
  - Contribute to the design and build scalable microservices,
    APIs, and data pipelines for high-dimensional simulation
    data across the ML lifecycle, working within established
    architectural patterns.
  - Build and maintain automated data ingestion and processing
    pipelines that power active learning loops, serving both
    no-code and pro-code users.
  - Implement and integrate data infrastructure components (Data
    Warehouses, Data Lakes, storage solutions) for simulation
    and deep learning workloads.
  - Build internal tools that enable BI dashboards and
    scientific data visualizations, making large datasets
    intuitive and accessible.
  - Own features end-to-end — from implementation through
    testing, deployment, and maintenance — writing clean,
    well-tested, secure code.
  - Contribute to reliability standards, performance monitoring,
    and quality of service metrics. Identify and help resolve
    performance bottlenecks.
  - Follow and contribute to API schema standards, security
    practices, and data access control patterns.
  - Participate in CI/CD pipeline maintenance, automated
    testing, and observability practices, including supporting
    zero-downtime deployments.
  - Participate in code reviews, knowledge sharing, and cross-
    functional collaboration with data scientists and
    researchers.
  - Contribute to Technical Decision Records and team
    discussions on tooling and architectural trade-offs.
  
  What you bring to the table
  
  - A passion for the craft — you're driven by engineering
    excellence and committed to fostering that culture across
    the team.
  - Strong software engineering foundations — solid grasp of
    algorithms, data structures, and system design. You write
    clean, maintainable, testable code in Python with working
    knowledge of Golang or Rust.
  - Data platform exposure — experience building or contributing
    to data processing systems in production. Familiarity with
    tools like Databricks, Snowflake, or BigQuery and concepts
    around Data Warehouses and Data Lakes.
  - API and service design — experience working with multi-
    service architectures, understanding schema design and
    data access patterns.
  - Security and reliability awareness — understanding of
    security fundamentals, monitoring, alerting, and quality
    of service in production systems.
  - CI/CD familiarity — practical experience with CI/CD
    pipelines and deployment workflows.
  - Safe code execution awareness — understanding of or interest
    in sandboxing, isolation, and security considerations for
    running user-submitted code.
  - Problem-solving — ability to diagnose issues, debug across
    services, and optimize data processing performance.
  - Communication and collaboration — strong communication
    skills for working with cross-functional teams.
    Comfortable participating in code reviews and supporting
    peers.
  - Incremental mindset — you work in small steps, balance
    detail with the big picture, and proactively seek help
    when blocked.
  
  Ideally
  
  - Programming skills: strong Python expertise and experience
    with at least one compiled language (Golang, C++, or
    Rust).
  - Data systems experience: practical experience building and
    maintaining data processing systems, working with diverse
    data types and running analytics on large datasets.
  - Kubernetes and infrastructure: familiarity with Kubernetes
    concepts and infrastructure configuration tools (e.g.,
    Helm, ArgoCD).
  - Testing and debugging: solid debugging and troubleshooting
    skills, with exposure to automated testing practices.
  - Bonus: understanding of 3D geometry processing, physics
    simulation data structures, or building software for
    different deployment environments (cloud, on-premises).
