  Who We Are
  
  At Apptegy, we are more than a tech company; we are partners
  dedicated to transforming how schools communicate and shape
  the future of education. Your work here will directly
  empower districts to share their stories, engage their
  communities, and celebrate student success. We're a team of
  thoughtful, high-performing individuals committed to making
  a tangible impact. If you're looking for a dynamic
  environment where you'll be supported with exceptional
  mentorship and resources to grow your career, come build
  with us.
  
  Why You’ll Love This Job
  
  We are hiring an AI Operations Engineer who thrives on
  building creative, fast-moving solutions that unlock
  operational efficiency and connect people, processes, and
  tools across the organization.
  
  In this role, you will serve as a cross-functional liaison
  and hands-on builder, partnering with Sales, Client
  Experience, Marketing, Product, and Finance to design and
  implement AI-powered workflows that make our teams more
  effective. You will focus on using tools like N8N, Glean,
  Fin, ChatGPT-5, and Gemini to automate, integrate, and scale
  how we work without needing to reinvent the wheel.
  
  This is not a traditional engineering role. It is ideal for
  someone who loves solving complex problems at the
  intersection of technology and business operations, a true
  solutions engineer who is just as comfortable connecting
  APIs as collaborating with leaders across business units.
  You will also work closely with our Program Manager Lead to
  align efforts, ensure adoption, and share best practices
  company-wide.
  
  What You'll Do
  
  - Integrate AI across the business by collaborating with
    leaders in Sales, Client Experience, Marketing, Product,
    and Finance to identify workflow bottlenecks and design AI
    solutions that improve speed, accuracy, and collaboration.
  - Build and automate smart workflows using Glean/N8N,
    AgentForce, Fin, Snowflake or custom development to
    connect systems, automate data flows, and eliminate
    repetitive manual work.
  - Prototype and deploy quickly by creating and iterating
    lightweight, no-code or low-code prototypes that can
    evolve into scalable solutions.
  - Act as a cross-functional liaison to translate operational
    challenges into technical implementations that align with
    business objectives.
  - Partner for implementation with the Program Manager Lead to
    coordinate rollouts, gather feedback, and drive adoption
    across teams.
  - Share what works by documenting tools, playbooks, and use
    cases to help teams experiment confidently with new AI
    technologies.
  - Continuously improve systems by testing new tools or
    recommending improvements to enhance Apptegy’s AI
    infrastructure.
  
   What You’ll Bring
  
  - 2–4+ years of experience in a technical, operations, or
    automation-focused role such as solutions engineering,
    RevOps, or technical program management.
  - Proficiency with no-code or low-code and AI tools such as
    SalesForce, Clay, Zapier/Make/Glean/N8N, Retool, Intercom,
    PlanHate.
  - Experience integrating systems via APIs, webhooks, and data
    flows, including Salesforce, HubSpot, analytics, and
    financial systems.
  - Strong cross-functional collaboration skills with the
    ability to translate business needs into clear, actionable
    technical solutions.
  - A builder’s mindset that is creative, curious, and eager to
    experiment with new technologies to drive efficiency.
  - Excellent communication skills and comfort working with
    multiple stakeholders in a fast-moving environment.
  
  What Makes You Stand Out
  
  - Experience in B2B SaaS, EdTech, or fintech industries.
  - Familiarity with scripting or data tools such as Python,
    JavaScript, or SQL for customization and troubleshooting.
  - Understanding of AI-powered automation systems and data
    enrichment tools.
  - Prior experience supporting RevOps or GTM functions with
    automation or AI workflows.
