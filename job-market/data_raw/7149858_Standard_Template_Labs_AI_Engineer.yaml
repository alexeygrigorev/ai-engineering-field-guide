  Standard Template Labs is a stealth-mode, AI-native startup
  reimagining the future of IT Service and Configuration
  Management. Backed by leading investors, we're leveraging
  AI, graph-based architecture, and exceptional design to
  transform how enterprises manage and engage with their
  technology ecosystems.
  
  About the Role
  
  Our team is currently seeking AI Engineers that will design,
  build, and deploy machine learning systems that form the
  intelligence layer of our ITSM platform. You will work on
  problems such as natural language understanding of IT
  tickets, dynamic knowledge extraction, intelligent workflow
  automation, and predictive insights from complex IT
  infrastructure data. This is a hands-on engineering role
  with the opportunity to define the AI foundation of a
  company from day one.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Research, prototype, and productionize machine learning
    models for ITSM use cases (ticket triage, incident
    prediction, workflow recommendations, CMDB inference).
  - Build scalable training and inference pipelines that
    integrate seamlessly into the core platform.
  - Experiment with LLMs, embeddings, and retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG) for IT knowledge and workflow automation.
  - Partner with engineers and product managers to define AI-
    first features that differentiate our platform.
  - Evaluate performance, optimize models, and ensure
    reliability, scalability, and cost-efficiency of AI
    systems.
  - Stay current with advances in machine learning, LLMs, and AI
    infrastructure, and apply them pragmatically.
  
  Qualifications
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s in Computer Science, AI/ML, or
    related field; PhD is a plus.
  - Strong software engineering fundamentals (Python preferred)
    and experience with ML frameworks such as PyTorch or
    TensorFlow.
  - Experience with one or more of: natural language processing
    (NLP), large language models (LLMs), information
    retrieval, graph ML, or time-series forecasting.
  - Understanding of modern MLOps practices: model versioning,
    deployment, monitoring, and lifecycle management.
  - Comfort working in a fast-paced startup environment with
    end-to-end ownership.
  - Bonus: experience applying AI in enterprise software or ITSM
    contexts.
  
  What We Offer
  
  - Build foundational product features for an AI-first
    enterprise platform
  - The opportunity to take ownership of critical systems that
    scale to millions of users
  - A culture that values craftsmanship, autonomy, and technical
    excellence
  - Competitive compensation, equity, and benefits package
  - Work from our Flatiron District, Manhattan office, where
    you’ll be side-by-side with the founding team in a
    supportive, collaborative setting. Our team works on-site
    five days a week, growing and building together, and the
    location is easy to reach with plenty of public
    transportation options.
