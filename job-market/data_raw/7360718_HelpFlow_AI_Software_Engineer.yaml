  Position: AI Software Engineer
  
  Working Hours: US Business Hours
  
  Hiring Company: We are a 10 year old remote staffing
  business with a fully remote team of 100+ employees. We
  started as a customer service agency, but have leveraged our
  client experience and technical acumen to become the
  industry's first AI empowered (human) virtual assistant
  service.
  
  About the Role: We’re seeking an AI Software Engineer to
  build a multi-agent system that integrates AI Agents into
  business teams. You’ll work directly with our CEO (a highly
  technical domain expert, but non-coder) to turn a clear
  vision and technical spec into a live system. This is a
  strategic project to be spun out of a 10-year-old remote
  staffing business with over 100 clients—giving us the
  ability to innovate with you and the ability to invest in
  growth at launch.
  
  Key Responsibilities:
  
  - Planning‬‭ - Collaborate to translate vision and initial
    technical specs into a development plan that you are
    confident in building.‬
  - ‭ Decisions‬‭ - As part of developing the plan, make
    architecture and strategy decisions that may need to
    change from initial spec.‬
  - ‭ Process‬‭ - Execute best practice development process
    against the plan, leveraging your development experience‬‭
    and‬‭ AI coding.‬
  - ‭ Collaboration‬‭ - You will be primarily building, but
    collaboration on product strategy and project management
    will be important.‬
  
  Requirements
  
  ‬
  
  Experience based: ( * are required)‬
  
  - * Strong programming skills (without AI) - real-world
    experience writing and shipping production code
  - ‭* Deep experience with AI-powered software development -
    primarily using Cursor in a systematic and scalable way.‬
  - * Technical experience building on OpenAI APIs and multi
    agent SDKs (CrewAI, Vercel, and recently OpenAI Agents
    SDK).‬
  - Experience working with cross functional cofounding teams -
    including non coders that are involved in technical work.‬
  - Proven ability to build for short‬‭ AND long term - high-
    leverage, modular systems, balancing technical debt vs
    momentum.‬
  
  ‭ Mindset based:‬
  
  - ‬All In on AI Development - you already build with AI, and
    you’re pushing the edges of what’s possible.‬
  - You Know The AI Space - You’re listening to AI podcasts and
    are active on X, testing and applying new insights
    regularly.‬
  - Obsessively Innovating with AI - always refining how you use
    AI tools to reduce friction and increase quality.‬
  - Curious and Optimistic - You approach novel problems and new
    technology with excitement, not skepticism.‬
  - Entrepreneurial - You love building, but you love seeing
    what you’ve built drive results. You thrive in the fast-
    moving‬ startup environment and get energy from the grind
    of building something quickly.‬
  
  Benefits
  
  This is a 3 month contract role, with the opportunity to
  move to full time employment in the future.
