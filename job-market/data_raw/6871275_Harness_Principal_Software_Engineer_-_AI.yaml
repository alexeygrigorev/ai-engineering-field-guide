  Harness is the AI Software Delivery Platform company, led by

  maintaining security and governance throughout the entire
  software delivery lifecycle.
  
  Powered by Harness AI and the Software Delivery Knowledge
  Graph, the Harness Platform applies deep context and
  intelligent automation across the software delivery
  lifecycle with governance and policy-driven controls
  embedded throughout the platform.
  
  Over the past year, Harness powered over 185M deployments,
  82M builds, 18T flag evaluations, 8M security scans, 9.1B
  optimized tests, 3T protected API calls, and helped manage
  $2.8B in cloud spend — enabling customers like United
  Airlines, Morningstar, and Choice Hotels to accelerate
  releases by up to 75%, reduce cloud costs by up to 60%, and
  achieve 10x DevOps efficiency.
