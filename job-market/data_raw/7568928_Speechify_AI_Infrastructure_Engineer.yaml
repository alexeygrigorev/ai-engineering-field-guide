  Mission
  
  The mission of Speechify is to make sure that reading is
  never a barrier to learning.
  
  Over 50 million people use Speechify’s text-to-speech
  products to turn whatever they’re reading – PDFs, books,
  Google Docs, news articles, websites – into audio, so they
  can read faster, read more, and remember more. Speechify’s
  text-to-speech reading products include its iOS app, Android
  App, Mac App, Chrome Extension, and Web App. Google recently
  named Speechify the Chrome Extension of the Year and Apple
  named Speechify its 2025 Design Award winner for
  Inclusivity.
  
  Today, nearly 200 people around the globe work on Speechify
  in a 100% distributed setting – Speechify has no office.
  These include frontend and backend engineers, AI research
  scientists, and others from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google,
  leading PhD programs like Stanford, high growth startups
  like Stripe, Vercel, Bolt, and many founders of their own
  companies.
  
  Overview
  
  We are looking for AI Infrastructure engineer to help build
  and scale the infrastructure that powers our machine
  learning initiatives. In this role, you will design,
  develop, and optimize the core platforms and services that
  enable data scientists and ML engineers to train, deploy,
  and monitor models efficiently. You’ll partner closely with
  Data Science, Data Engineering, and Product teams to create
  a robust, self-service ML ecosystem that accelerates
  innovation.
  
  What You’ll Do
  
  Build & Scale AI Infrastructure: Design, implement, and
  maintain high-performance ML training and inference
  platforms. Develop MLOps Tools: Ship tools that allow any ML
  engineer to deploy a model in minutes, not days. Optimize
  Performance: Improve scalability, reliability, and cost
  efficiency of model training and serving systems.
  Collaborate Across Teams: Partner with researchers to turn
  experimental voice models into production-ready systems.
  Ensure Best Practices: Establish standards for model
  versioning, testing, monitoring, and governance. Drive
  Automation: Automate data/model pipelines to reduce manual
  intervention and speed up experimentation.
  
  - Experience: 3+ years in Software Engineering or ML
    Platform/Infrastructure roles, with a focus on distributed
    systems, cloud services, or MLOps.
  - Technical Expertise: Proficiency in Python (or similar),
    containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), CI/CD pipelines,
    Kubernetes, Cloud proficiency
  - Strong knowledge of cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and
    infrastructure-as-code tools (Terraform, CloudFormation).
  - Experience with ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, or
    similar) and orchestration tools (Kubeflow, Airflow,
    MLflow).
  - Deep understanding of data pipelines, model deployment,
    real-time inference systems, and reliability of AI systems
  - Strong communication skills and the ability to work across
    engineering and data science teams.
  - Hands-on with CI/CD and Model Serving
  
  Nice to Have
  
  - Experience with feature stores, vector databases, or large-
    scale model training.
  - Familiarity with streaming data technologies (Kafka, Spark
    Streaming, Flink).
  - Knowledge of monitoring/observability tools (Prometheus,
    Grafana, Datadog).
  - Contributions to open-source ML/MLOps projects.
  - GPU optimization (TensorRT, ONNX, vLLM, Triton)
  - Experience with low-latency audio/streaming systems
  - Familiarity with vector DBs or feature stores
  
  What we offer
  
  - A dynamic environment where your contributions shape the
    company and its products
  - A team that values innovation, intuition, and drive
  - Autonomy, fostering focus and creativity
  - The opportunity to have a significant impact in a
    revolutionary industry
  - Competitive compensation, a welcoming atmosphere, and a
    commitment to an exceptional asynchronous work culture
  - The privilege of working on a product that changes lives,
    particularly for those with learning differences like
    dyslexia, ADD, and more
  - An active role at the intersection of artificial
    intelligence and audio – a rapidly evolving tech domain
