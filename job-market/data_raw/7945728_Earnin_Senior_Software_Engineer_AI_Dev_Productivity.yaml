  About EarnIn
  
  As one of the first pioneers of earned wage access, our
  passion at EarnIn is building products that deliver real-
  time financial flexibility for those with the unique needs
  of living paycheck to paycheck. Our community members access
  their earnings as they earn them, with options to spend,

  We’re fortunate to have an incredibly experienced leadership
  team, combined with world-class funding partners like A16Z,
  Matrix Partners, DST, Ribbit Capital, and a very healthy
  core business with a tremendous runway. We’re growing fast
  and are excited to continue bringing world-class talent
  onboard to help shape the next chapter of our growth
  journey.
  
  POSITION SUMMARY
  
  As a Senior Software Engineer, you will contribute to the
  company-wide strategy for AI native software development,
  debugging, and testing. You will partner directly with
  engineering and product leadership to transform how hundreds
  of engineers work. You will move beyond simple tool adoption
  to design structured, agentic workflows that accelerate
  productivity and improve software quality through
  responsible AI integration.
  
  You will join the Developer Productivity team within the
  Platform Engineering org. Our mission is to empower our
  engineers to ship high-quality products with confidence and
  high velocity. You'll help transform the software
  development lifecycle (SDLC) by embedding cutting-edge AI
  into the core of how we build, test, and ship software. This
  position will be hybrid, based in our Bengaluru office, as
  part of our expanding site. EarnIn provides excellent
  employee benefits, including healthcare, internet/cell phone
  reimbursement, a learning and development stipend, and
  opportunities to collaborate with and travel to our Palo
  Alto HQ and Bangkok Site. Our salary ranges are determined
  by role, level, and location.
  
  WHAT YOU'LL DO
  
  - Translate the roadmap and architecture for integrating AI
    into core developer workflows. Evaluate and implement
    advanced architectures, including LLMs, RAG, and MCP.
  - Build and maintain AI-augmented developer tools across our
    ecosystem (IDE/CLI, GitHub, Slack, Atlassian, and internal
    IDP) to reduce manual effort and cycle time.
  - Design structured, agentic flows across the SDLC. This
    includes creating workflows for code authoring, automated
    test generation, incident response, and onboarding,
    leveraging tool use with human-in-the-loop gates.
  - Develop and maintain integrations with existing SaaS
    solutions via APIs and custom connectors. Ensure AI
    capabilities are intuitive and accessible to non-technical
    audiences, as needed.
  - Lead internal enablement by creating playbooks, "golden
    prompts," and onboarding guides.
  - Collaborate with "AI champions" across teams to foster an
    AI-native engineering culture.
  - Drive measurable outcomes through data-driven
    experiments—track PR velocity, cycle time, and quality.
  
  WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR
  
  - Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science, Software
    Engineering, or related field (or equivalent practical
    experience).
  - 4+ years of software development experience, with a specific
    focus on developer productivity and efficiency. Fluency in
    at least one of the following languages: Python or Go.
  - Strong background in software engineering with experience
    building internal tools, developer platforms, or complex
    integrations.
  - Familiarity with structured/agentic AI workflow frameworks,
    LLMs, RAG architectures, and the MCP.
  - Experience working with developer APIs and platforms,
    including GitHub, Atlassian (Jira/Confluence), Slack, and
    Cortex.
  - Ability to evaluate LLM output quality using techniques like
    human-in-the-loop feedback, rubric scoring, and golden
    datasets.
  - Demonstrated ability to lead technical strategy and
    influence stakeholders.
  - Strong communication skills and the ability to work
    effectively in a geographically distributed team
    environment.
