  About Metaforms
  
  At Metaforms, we’re redefining how market research gets
  done.
  
  Our AI platform empowers the world’s leading research
  agencies to scale 10x faster while maintaining
  uncompromising quality. With AI Agents that augment survey
  programming, data processing, and project management, we
  help customers like Dynata, Savanta, and Borderless Access
  deliver more projects with less friction.
  
  - 📊 1,000+ surveys processed monthly
  - 🌍 Serving Fortune 500 companies
  - 📈 Experiencing rapid month-over-month growth
  
  We recently raised $9M in Series A funding, positioning us
  to aggressively scale our AI engineering team and build the
  next generation of production-grade AI agent systems.
  
  💡 The Role
  
  We’re hiring a Senior AI Engineer to lead the design,
  development, and refinement of AI agent systems that power
  modern research workflows.
  
  This role goes beyond building models — you’ll drive system-
  level innovation, mentor peers, and shape how our AI
  copilots tackle domain-specific challenges at scale. You’ll
  work at the intersection of cutting-edge research and
  engineering execution, ensuring reliability, robustness, and
  real-world impact.
  
  🔨 What You’ll Build
  
  Data Creation & Intelligence
  
  - Architect synthetic data pipelines to strengthen model
    performance on edge cases
  - Lead development of complex evaluation datasets (especially
    for DSLs) to systematically identify weaknesses
  - Build scalable systems for automated data verification and
    pipeline orchestration
  
  Model Response Analysis & Monitoring
  
  - Define rubrics and frameworks for evaluating nuanced,
    ambiguous AI tasks
  - Build monitoring and optimization systems for continuous
    production feedback loops
  - Create tools that empower domain experts to collaborate in
    evolving datasets & model behavior
  
  System Innovation & Scale
  
  - Research and implement novel approaches for long-context
    handling, cascading error reduction, and structured
    outputs
  - Advance prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and control
    techniques for greater reliability
  - Drive the design and evaluation of production-grade, agentic
    AI systems at scale
  
  🧑‍💻 What We’re Looking For
  
  Core Skills
  
  - Strong programming skills in Python
    (Go/JavaScript/TypeScript a plus)
  - Extensive experience with LLMs, synthetic data pipelines,
    evaluation frameworks, and system optimization
  - Deep knowledge of prompt engineering, fine-tuning,
    structured evaluation, and reliability techniques
  - Strong problem-solving, debugging, and analytical skills
    with a production-first mindset
  - Ability to communicate complex technical ideas to both
    technical and non-technical audiences
  - High ownership and leadership — comfortable leading
    projects, mentoring engineers, and driving experiments
    independently
  
  Bonus Points
  
  - Experience with model monitoring, bias evaluation, or
    dataset management systems
  - Background in semantic parsing, DSLs, or structured-output
    models
  - Passion for pioneering reliability and control in agentic AI
    systems
  - Previous experience in zero-to-one or scaling-stage AI
    companies
  
  🌟 Leadership & Impact
  
  As a Senior AI Engineer, you will:
  
  - Mentor and guide junior engineers, fostering technical
    growth and high-quality output
  - Help set engineering standards, best practices, and system
    design principles for AI pipelines
  - Partner with product and leadership to shape technical
    strategy and roadmap
  - Serve as a thought leader in agentic AI reliability and
    scale within the company
  
  🌟 Why Join Metaforms?
  
  - Lead at the cutting edge of AI agent and co-pilot system
    development
  - Work with a high-agency team shipping production-grade AI
    tools
  - Thrive in a zero-bureaucracy culture optimized for speed,
    quality, and user impact
  - Be part of a Series A funded company ($10M+), backed to
    scale aggressively
  
  🎁 Benefits
  
  - Full family health insurance
  - $1,000 USD annual reimbursement for skill development
  - Dedicated mentor/coach support
  - Free lunch & dinner at office
  - Monthly food/snacks allowance
  
  👉 Join Metaforms and help shape the future of AI-powered
  research systems at scale.
