description: |
  We are seeking a Data Engineer to join our Artist-First AI
  Music lab. Our team designs and builds state-of-the-art
  generative products for music that create breakthrough
  experiences for fans and artists. We invent entirely new
  listening experiences that center and celebrate artists and
  creatives. All of our products will put artists and
  songwriters first, through these four principles:
  
  Partnerships with record labels, distributors, and music
  publishers: We’ll develop new products for artists and fans
  through upfront agreements, not by asking for forgiveness
  later.
  
  Choice in participation: We recognize there’s a wide range
  of views on use of generative music tools within the
  artistic community. Therefore, artists and rightsholders
  will choose if and how to participate to ensure the use of
  AI tools aligns with the values of the people behind the
  music.
  
  Fair compensation and new revenue: We will build products
  that create wholly new revenue streams for rightsholders,
  artists, and songwriters, ensuring they are properly
  compensated for uses of their work and transparently
  credited for their contributions.
  
  Artist-fan connection: AI tools we develop will not replace
  human artistry. They will give artists new ways to be
  creative and connect with fans. We will maximise our role as
  the place where more than 700 million people already come to
  listen to music every month to ensure that generative AI
  deepens artist-fan connections.
