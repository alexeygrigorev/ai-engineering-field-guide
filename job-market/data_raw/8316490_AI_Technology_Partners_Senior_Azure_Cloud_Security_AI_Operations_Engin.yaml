description: |
  AI Technology Partners (AITP) is a leader in delivering
  cutting-edge generative AI solutions and managed services,
  specializing in secure, customizable AI deployments for
  enterprises. Our offerings are designed to help
  organizations unlock the full value of AI while maintaining
  robust security and compliance across their infrastructures.
  
  About the role
  
  At AI Technology Partners (AITP), we empower enterprises to
  scale revenue & profit —with secure, compliant generative AI
  solutions.
  
  This role is a force-multiplier on a small, high-trust team:
  you’ll design and run production-grade Azure platforms,
  embed security into every step, and use AI to accelerate
  delivery. If you like shipping, automating, and owning
  outcomes with real customer impact, you’ll fit right in.
  
  What you'll do
  
  Platform & DevOps
  
  ·      Own and evolve Azure foundations: subscription
  strategy, landing zones, networking (VNets, Private Link,
  Firewall), identity (Entra ID), secrets (Key Vault/Managed
  HSM), and data services (e.g., Cosmos DB, MongoDB Atlas,
  Storage).
  
  ·      Design, implement, and harden CI/CD (GitHub Actions
  and/or Azure DevOps) for apps, infra, and policies; champion
  Infrastructure as Code (Terraform and/or Bicep).
  
  ·      Build golden images/base containers, artifact
  pipelines, and automated drift detection.
  
  Security & Compliance (DevSecOps)
  
  ·      Operate and automate threat detection/response (e.g.,
  Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Cloud) and
  container/dependency scanning (e.g., Snyk, Trivy).
  
  ·      Enforce least-privilege IAM, certificate rotation,
  and secrets hygiene across environments.
  
  ·      Map controls to frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2,
  NIST, HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP contexts) and produce practical
  evidence via policy-as-code and reporting for our clients
  and certification processes.
  
  Reliability & Operations (SRE)
  
  ·      Establish SLOs/SLIs, error budgets, and proactive
  capacity/perf management.
  
  ·      Stand up end-to-end observability (e.g., Azure
  Monitor, Log Analytics, Application Insights, etc.) and
  actionable alerting; reduce MTTR with auto-remediation.
  
  ·      Lead incident response, post-incident reviews, and
  systemic hardening.
  
  AI-enabled automation
  
  ·      Use LLMs/code-gen to boost infra and ops workflows:
  pipeline scaffolding, policy generation, runbook creation,
  and knowledge capture.
  
  ·      Partner with our product/solutions teams to run AI
  workloads securely in production.
  
  Client-facing impact
  
  ·      Work directly with enterprise client teams; translate
  requirements into secure, reliable designs; present trade-
  offs; guide adoption and handover.
  
  Qualifications
  
  Must-have
  
  ·      Senior-level experience operating and securing Azure
  at scale (multi-subscription/tenant patterns, landing zones,
  network isolation, identity, and data).
  
  ·      Deep hands-on with Terraform (or Bicep), GitHub
  Actions/Azure DevOps, containers, and modern artifact
  workflows.
  
  ·      Practical Security: SIEM/SOAR (Sentinel or similar),
  image/dependency scanning, vulnerability management, and
  policy-as-code.
  
  ·      Strong observability chops (Azure Monitor/Log
  Analytics/App Insights, OpenTelemetry) and an SRE mindset.
  
  ·      Clear communicator who’s comfortable with client
  interaction and crisp written docs.
  
  ·      Azure Container Registry (ACR) including scaling,
  ingress, networking, and security.
  
  ·      GitHub Actions pipelines, workflows, and deployments.
  
  ·      Core Stack Experience & Summary:
  
  o   Infra as Code: Terraform
  
  o   Cloud & Containers: ACA, ACR, Key Vault, Storage, Cosmos
  DB, Monitor, App Insights, Application Gateway, Private
  Endpoints, Bastion
  
  o   Databases: MongoDB Atlas, Cosmos DB, MeiliSearch, Vector
  Search
  
  o   AI/ML: Azure OpenAI (GPT-4.1), LibreChat RAG pipelines,
  MeiliSearch, multi-cloud AI providers (OpenAI, Google
  Gemini, Cohere)
  
  o   CI/CD & DevOps: GitHub + GitHub Actions, Terraform
  automation, Docker workflows
  
  o   Security & Identity: Azure AD/Entra ID, OIDC/JWT,
  Defender/Sentinel, Key Vault, policy-as-code
  
  o   Observability: Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Application
  Insights
  
  Nice to Have
  
  ·      Cross-cloud exposure (AWS/GCP), private connectivity
  (ExpressRoute), and hybrid/on-prem integrations.
  
  ·      Background in secure enterprise environments; audit
  evidence automation and compliance reporting.
  
  Location
  
  Remote, US-based candidates preferred. The role may involve
  working across multiple time zones.
  
  How we work
  
  ·      Ownership & autonomy: You'll make architecture
  decisions and see them through production.
  
  ·      Small team, big leverage: Low ceremony, high impact;
  we value judgement and momentum.
  
  ·      Security by design: Controls are built-in, not bolted
  on.
  
  ·      AI in the loop: We use AI where it creates real
  leverage-never as theater.
  
  What we offer
  
  ·      Challenging work with modern AI workloads and
  demanding enterprise environments.
  
  ·      Learning & sharing culture with deep dives, brown
  bags, and support for certifications/publication.
  
  ·      Inclusive, flexible workplace—bring your whole self;
  work where you do your best thinking.
  
  How to Apply
  
  Interested candidates are encouraged to submit their resumes
  and a brief cover letter outlining relevant experience and
  why they are a good fit for this role.

  opportunity in all practices and reaffirms that there shall
