  Please be aware that some of our UK roles at PA Consulting
  require a UK security clearance.
  
  All PA people are required to undergo background checks and
  to achieve the Baseline Personnel Security Standard however,
  some UK roles also require higher levels of National
  Security Vetting, where applicants must have at least 5
  years of continuous residency in the UK.
  
  We therefore ask that you only apply if you meet the
  residency requirements (i.e. you are a British citizen or
  have been resident in the UK for the past 5 years), as this
  is the prerequisite for a security clearance. If you're
  unsure about your eligibility, we encourage you to review
  the UK Government’s guidance on security vetting before
  applying.
