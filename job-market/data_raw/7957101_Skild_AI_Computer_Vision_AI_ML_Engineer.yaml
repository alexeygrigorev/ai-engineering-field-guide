  Company Overview
  
  At Skild AI, we are building the world's first general
  purpose robotic intelligence that is robust and adapts to
  unseen scenarios without failing. We believe massive scale
  through data-driven machine learning is the key to unlocking
  these capabilities for the widespread deployment of robots
  within society. Our team consists of individuals with
  varying levels of experience and backgrounds, from new
  graduates to domain experts. Relevant industry experience is
  important, but ultimately less so than your demonstrated
  abilities and attitude. We are looking for passionate
  individuals who are eager to explore uncharted waters and
  contribute to our innovative projects.
  
  Position Overview
  
  We are seeking a Computer Vision AI & ML Engineer to design,
  build, and deploy advanced perception systems for real-world
  robotics and automation. You will work across the full
  machine learning lifecycle—model development, data strategy,
  evaluation, and production integration—to deliver robust,
  high-performance vision capabilities. This role combines
  applied research with hands-on engineering and offers the
  opportunity to influence both architecture and roadmap
  decisions.
  
  Responsibilities
  
  - Develop and optimize deep learning models for object
    detection, segmentation, tracking, and 3D scene
    understanding using multi-modal sensor data.
  - Build scalable pipelines for data processing, training,
    evaluation, and deployment into real-world and real-time
    systems.
  - Design labeling strategies and tooling for automated
    annotation, QA workflows, dataset management,
    augmentation, and versioning.
  - Implement monitoring and reliability frameworks, including
    uncertainty estimation, failure detection, and automated
    performance reporting.
  - Conduct proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate new
    algorithms and perception techniques; translate research
    insights into practical prototypes.
  - Collaborate with robotics, systems, and simulation teams to
    integrate perception models into production pipelines and
    improve end-to-end performance.
  
  Preferred Qualifications
  
  - Strong experience with deep learning frameworks (PyTorch,
    TensorFlow, or JAX).
  - Background in computer vision tasks such as detection,
    segmentation, tracking, or 3D scene understanding.
  - Proficiency in Python; familiarity with C++ is a plus.
  - Experience building training pipelines, evaluation
    frameworks, and ML deployment workflows.
  - Knowledge of 3D geometry, sensor processing, or multi-sensor
    fusion (RGB-D, LiDAR, stereo).
  - Experience with data annotation tools, dataset management,
    and augmentation techniques.
  - Familiarity with robotics, simulation environments (Isaac
    Sim, Gazebo, Blender), or real-time systems.
  - Understanding of uncertainty modeling, reliability
    engineering, or ML monitoring/MLOps practices.
