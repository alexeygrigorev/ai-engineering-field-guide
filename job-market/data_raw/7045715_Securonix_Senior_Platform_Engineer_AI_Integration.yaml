description: |
  Securonix is leading the transformation of cybersecurity by
  helping organizations stay ahead of modern threats. Security
  teams are no longer constrained by data or tools. They are
  constrained by speed, clarity, and confidence. Securonix was
  built to close that gap. Our mission is to enable security
  teams to decide and act faster across the entire threat
  lifecycle.
  
  
  The Securonix Unified Defense SIEM is the industry’s first
  platform powered by agentic AI and designed with a human-in-
  the-loop philosophy. It unifies detection, investigation,
  and response in a single system. Advanced UEBA delivers deep
  behavioral insight across users, entities, and data. Native
  threat intelligence continuously enriches detections and
  investigations with real-world context. AI reinforces every
  layer of the platform while keeping accountability with the
  security team.
  
  
  Built cloud-native for scale and performance, the platform
  enables real-time analytics, deep investigation, and
  automated response without compromise. Analysts gain faster
  access to relevant signals. Investigations move from days to
  minutes. Response becomes consistent and measurable. The
  result is a CyberOps experience that scales as threats
  evolve.
  
  
  Securonix is recognized as a six-time Leader in the Gartner
  Magic Quadrant for SIEM and a Customers’ Choice on Gartner
  Peer Insights. The company has been featured by leading
  publications including WIRED, Dark Reading, and Fortune for
  its innovation and leadership in security operations.
  Organizations rely on the platform for always-available
  data, rapid search and investigation, continuously updated
  threat content, and a fully integrated Threat Detection,
  Investigation, and Response experience.
  
  
  Backed by Vista Equity Partners, one of the world’s leading
  enterprise software investors, Securonix benefits from deep
  operational expertise and a long-term commitment to
  innovation and growth. This partnership strengthens our
  ability to scale the platform, accelerate product execution,
  and support customers as their security needs evolve.
  
  
  With more than 1,000 customers worldwide, including a
  meaningful portion of the Fortune 100, Securonix operates at
  global scale. Our ecosystem of partners and managed security
  service providers extends that reach, helping organizations
  deploy and operate with confidence wherever they do
  business. What drives us is how we work.
  
  - We win as one team. We operate with trust, respect, and
    shared accountability.
  - We are customer driven. Innovation is guided by real
    security challenges and measurable outcomes.
  - We act with agility. Change is constant, and we stay aligned
    on purpose while adapting fast.
  
  That focus is how Securonix helps organizations move from
  reactive security to proactive, autonomous operations.
