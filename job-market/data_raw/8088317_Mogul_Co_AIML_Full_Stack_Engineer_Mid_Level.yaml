  Who We Are:
  
  Winning today isn’t about spending more. It’s about knowing
  more. Understanding more. Seeing more. And acting sooner
  than everyone else.
  
  Mogul & Co is The Media Intelligence Company — a combination
  of predictive technology, advanced analytics, and high-
  performance media acquisition designed to answer one
  question with clarity:
  
  How does every $1 in media create the next $10 in revenue
  and business growth?
  
  We are entering a pivotal phase, expanding rapidly with
  strong revenue growth. Our leadership integrates two worlds:
  
  - Silicon Valley hyper-growth operators with experience
    building frontier AI, automation, and data platforms.
  
  - Fortune 500 and agency executives who have managed global
    P&Ls, overseen billions in media investment, and led major
    transactions.
  
  This blend shapes how we operate: focused, precise, data-
  driven, and oriented toward long-term value creation.
  
  About the Role:
  
  We’re seeking a AI/ML Full Stack Engineer to join the elite
  team scaling the technology behind our Predictive
  Intelligence platform. You’ll work at the intersection of
  machine learning, data engineering, and product
  development—creating the tools that allow clients to see
  weeks or months into the future with unprecedented accuracy.
  This is an excellent opportunity for an engineer looking to
  grow their AI/ML and full-stack skills in a high-impact
  environment
  
  You will work across the full stack, from data ingestion and
  modeling to APIs and client-facing interfaces. This role
  goes beyond basic analytics or dashboarding. You will help
  design and productionize systems that integrate large-scale,
  real-time, multi-source data, apply predictive and causal
  modeling, and continuously learn from new signals.
  
  This is an ideal role for an engineer who wants deep
  exposure to real-world AI systems, complex data
  environments, and mathematically grounded prediction at
  scale.
  
  Key Responsibilities:
  
  - Design, build, and maintain full-stack applications that
    deliver predictive insights through scalable, user-facing
    interfaces
  
  - Develop and maintain automated data pipelines for ingesting,
    processing, and transforming large-scale structured and
    unstructured data
  
  - Implement, deploy, and maintain machine learning models
    including forecasting, regression, classification, and
    ensemble methods
  
  - Apply statistical and machine learning techniques to support
    forward-looking analysis and decision-making
  
  - Build and maintain backend services, APIs, and integrations
    that support analytics and modeling workflows
  
  - Support experimentation, testing, and validation of models
    and analytical outputs
  
  - Work with modern AI approaches, including large language
    models, to support automation and data-driven workflows
  
  - Optimize system performance, reliability, and scalability
    across data pipelines and ML services
  
  - Collaborate cross-functionally with engineering, product,
    and analytics teams to translate requirements into
    technical solutions
  
  - Contribute to best practices for code quality, monitoring,
    and operational stability of production ML systems
  
  Required Qualifications:
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Data Science,
    Statistics, Mathematics, Engineering, or a related
    quantitative field
  
  - 2–4 years of professional experience in software engineering
    with exposure to full-stack development
  
  - Strong proficiency in Python for data processing, modeling,
    and backend services
  
  - Experience with JavaScript/TypeScript and modern frontend
    frameworks such as React or similar
  
  - Hands-on experience building, training, evaluating, or
    deploying machine learning models in production or near-
    production environments
  
  - Solid grounding in statistics, probability, linear algebra,
    and predictive modeling concepts
  
  - Experience working with time-series data, forecasting,
    regression, or classification problems
  
  - Strong SQL skills and experience working with relational
    and/or analytical databases
  
  - Experience building and consuming REST or GraphQL APIs
  
  - Familiarity with cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, or Azure
    and cloud-native architectures
  
  - Ability to reason about data quality, bias, model
    assumptions, and uncertainty
  
  - Strong problem-solving ability and comfort working in
    ambiguous, evolving technical environments
  
  Preferred Qualifications:
  
  - Experience with advanced ML frameworks such as PyTorch,
    TensorFlow, or JAX
  
  - Exposure to probabilistic modeling, Bayesian methods, causal
    inference, or simulation-based approaches
  
  - Experience with large language models, embeddings, vector
    databases, or retrieval-augmented systems
  
  - Familiarity with data orchestration and pipeline tools such
    as Airflow, Dagster, or dbt
  
  - Experience working with streaming or near-real-time data
    pipelines
  
  - Knowledge of containerization and deployment using Docker
    and CI/CD workflows
  
  - Experience with observability and monitoring for ML systems
  
  - Background or strong interest in AdTech, MarTech, economics,
    or large-scale analytics systems
  
  - Understanding of experimentation frameworks, A/B testing, or
    model validation strategies
  
  - Master’s degree in a technical or quantitative field
  
  Compensation:
  
  - Base Salary: $110k–$130k
  
  - Equity Grant with Quarterly Profit Participation
  
  - Aggressive Year-Round Bonus Program
  
  Joining Now Means:
  
  - Higher Equity Ownership & Profit Participation
  
  - Accelerated Leadership Paths
  
  - Patents Contribution and Industry-Leading Innovation
  
  - Continued Perks, Benefits, Compensation that increase with
    hyper-growth
  
  - Chicago, New York, Los Angeles Offices
  
  - Big Company Operations, Startup Culture
  
  Culture & Working Style:
  
  We operate with the urgency of a startup and the discipline
  forged from over a decade of operations and growth:
  
  - Move fast with precision
  
  - High collaboration across technical and commercial teams
  
  - Ownership mindset with real autonomy and accountability
  
  - Decisions grounded in data, testing, and measurable outcomes
  
  - Hybrid flexibility balanced with intentional in-person
    collaboration
  
  If you thrive in environments where complexity is embraced,
  learning is constant, and your work directly shapes the
  product and business, you’ll fit right in.
