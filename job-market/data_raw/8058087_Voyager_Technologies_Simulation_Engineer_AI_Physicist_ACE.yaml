  Job Summary:
  
  We are seeking an AI Software Engineer – Agents to build and
  harden the domain-specific agents that power the Agentic
  Computational Engineering platform. In this role, you will
  design, implement, and maintain AI agents that behave like
  focused junior engineers – thermal analysts, supply-chain
  scouts, G-code validators, and more.
  
  You will sit at the intersection of prompt engineering, tool
  integration, and evaluation. This role is a fit for someone
  who already uses LLMs daily, who gets impatient when they
  can’t automate a task, and who wants to see their agents
  move real hardware in the loop, not just push text around.
  
  You will be joining the Agentic Computational Engineering
  (ACE) team, a specialized group within our Advanced
  Technology Development organization. ACE is responsible for
  building Voyager’s Generative Engine – the AI-native
  platform that compresses complex hardware development cycles
  from years to days. We design agentic AI systems that pair
  deeply with physics simulation, test data, and modern
  manufacturing so that Design for Manufacturing (DfM), Design
  for Assembly (DfA), and Design for Test (DfT) are built into
  the very first line of code and the very first sketch of a
  design.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Design, implement, and deploy production-ready AI agents
    using frameworks such as LangGraph or Agent Development
    Kits from Google, OpenAI, or Anthropic.
  - Define clear agent roles, goals, and capabilities, including
    prompts, tool schemas, and decision-making loops (e.g.,
    ReAct, plan-and-solve).
  - Develop and maintain Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
    that expose Voyager’s internal systems (PLM, ERP,
    simulation, repositories) to agents.
  - Integrate external and internal engineering tools (e.g.,
    Ansys, Altium, SolidWorks, Python toolchains) as robust,
    secure agent tools.
  - Build evaluation suites and benchmarks that measure agent
    performance on realistic tasks (e.g., exam-style physics
    problems, PCB routing, CAD edits).
  - Collaborate closely with domain experts to encode
    manufacturing, test, and safety constraints directly into
    agent behavior.
  - Use LLMs as a development accelerator for scaffolding code,
    writing tests, and generating documentation for agent
    systems.
  
  Required Qualifications:
  
  - 1–5 years of professional software engineering experience
    (exceptional new graduates and early-career engineers
    encouraged to apply).
  - Strong proficiency in Python and experience building backend
    services and APIs or ability to rapidly learn (REST/gRPC).
  - Hands-on experience building LLM-powered agents or tools
    using frameworks such as LangChain/LangGraph or similar
    (professional, research, or serious personal projects).
  - Demonstrated habit of using LLMs and agents to accelerate
    development rather than writing all boilerplate by hand.
  - Experience designing and documenting clean, versioned APIs
    and data schemas.
  
  Preferred Qualifications:
  
  - Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Physics,
    Mathematics, or a related field; or equivalent experience.
  - Ability to read and reason about schematics, mechanical
    drawings, and technical documentation.
  - Portfolio of personal projects involving robotics, 3D
    printing, electronics, or other physical-world builds.
  - Experience building internal tooling for engineering, R&D,
    or manufacturing organizations.
  - The strongest candidates will provide links to outstanding
    work (or descriptions when not possible to link) and
    evidence of experience and passion for leveraging agentic
    teams for rapid development.
  
  Voyager offers a comprehensive, total compensation package,
  which includes competitive salary, a discretionary annual
  bonus plan, paid time off (PTO), a comprehensive health
  benefit package, retirement savings, wellness program, and
  various other benefits. When you join our team, you’re not
  just an employee; you become part of a dynamic community
  dedicated to innovation and excellence.
  
  To conform to U.S. Government space technology export
  regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms
  Regulations (ITAR) you must be a U.S. citizen, lawful
  permanent resident of the U.S., protected individual as
  defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3), or eligible to obtain the
  required authorizations from the U.S. Department of State.
  
  Voyager is an Equal Opportunity Employer. Employment
  decisions are made without regard to race, color, religion,
