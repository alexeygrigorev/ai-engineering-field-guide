  Our Interview Practices
  
  To maintain a fair and genuine hiring process, we kindly ask
  that all candidates participate in interviews without the
  assistance of AI tools or external prompts. Our interview
  process is designed to assess your individual skills,
  experiences, and communication style. We value authenticity
  and want to ensure we’re getting to know you—not a digital
  assistant. To help maintain this integrity, we ask to remove
  virtual backgrounds and include in-person interviews in our
  hiring process. Please note that use of AI-generated
  responses or third-party support during interviews will be
  grounds for disqualification from the recruitment process.
  
  Applicants may be required to appear onsite at a Wolters
  Kluwer office as part of the recruitment process.
