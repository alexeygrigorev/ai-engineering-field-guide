  About the Role
  
  We are looking for a Senior Applied AI Engineer to build
  production-grade, multimodal (audio/video/text) systems that
  convert broadcast and radio feeds into structured, real-time
  signals and event candidates. You will implement and evolve
  “agentic” components (sensor agents, specialist agents,
  decision logic) that power products like Audio Intelligence,
  semi-automated broadcast-to-data tagging, and
  highlight/momentum signals.
  
  We will lean on your technical expertise and your pragmatic
  approach to problem solving; working in a team that
  prioritizes the principles of Agile delivery and continuous
  improvement. You will have a Data-driven, evidence-based
  mentality, comfortable with the principles of continuous
  experimentation and validation.
  
  Key Responsibilities
  
  - Build and maintain multimodal agents:
  - Implement streaming-friendly pipelines: chunking,
    normalization, time-sync, async execution, and robust
    retry/backoff for model/tool calls.
  - Develop prompt-as-code with strict JSON contracts, schema
    validation, and deterministic post-processing to reduce
    brittleness.
  - Improve system robustness under noisy inputs by:
  - Partner with product, platform, and domain leads to
    translate sport rules/edge cases into validation logic and
    to integrate outputs into downstream consumers (tagging,
    live feeds, analytics).
  - Contribute to the evaluation workflow by adding test cases,
    failure mode categories, and regression checks for prompts
    and model routing.
  - Stay up-to-date with emerging Gen AI technologies, tools,
    and best practices.
  - Mentor and support other team members in data engineering
    principles and practices.
  
  
  Qualifications 
  
  - 5–8+ years of professional software engineering experience
    (backend and/or ML systems).
  - Strong proficiency in one or more of: Python, Java, Rust.
  - Hands-on experience building production services involving
    LLM or multimodal model integration (including Gemini,
    ChatGPT or Claude).
  - Comfortable with ambiguity, iterative experimentation, and
    evidence-based decision-making in an Agile environment.
  - Experience with streaming data platforms like Kafka, Pulsar,
    Flink
  - Experience with AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI
  - Familiarity with version control systems (e.g., Git).
  - Excellent problem-solving skills and attention to detail.
  - Ability to work independently and as part of a team.
  - Strong communication skills.
  
  
  Preferred Qualifications 
  
  - Experience with audio ML / speech / acoustic event
    detection, or media pipelines (audio/video chunking,
    sync).
  - Experience with RAG or rules/config grounding for sport-
    specific logic (league configs, terminology, rulebooks).
  - Familiarity with evaluation practices (golden sets,
    precision/recall, drift monitoring) and production
    observability.
  - Experience operating systems where cost/latency tradeoffs
    matter (routing “flash vs heavy” models, caching,
    batching).
  
  The salary for this role is based on an annualized range of
  $180,000 - $240,000 USD. This role will also be eligible to
  take part in Genius Sports Group's benefits plan.
