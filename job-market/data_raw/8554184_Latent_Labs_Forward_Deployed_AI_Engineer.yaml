  Forward Deployed AI Engineer
  
  The opportunity
  
  We are looking for a Forward Deployed AI Engineer to serve
  as the critical bridge between Latent Labs’ frontier
  generative models and the customers who rely on them. You
  will work directly with pharmaceutical and biotech customers
  to deploy, integrate and optimise our technology within
  their scientific workflows. This is a highly technical,
  customer-facing role that combines deep infrastructure
  expertise with a passion for solving real-world problems in
  drug discovery and protein engineering.
  
  You will work closely with our customers, understanding
  their unique technical environments and ensuring that our
  generative biology platform integrates seamlessly with their
  systems. You will own the full lifecycle of customer
  deployments - from initial technical scoping through to
  production-grade delivery - and act as the voice of the
  customer back into our product and research teams.
  
  Who we are
  
  At Latent Labs, we are building frontier models that learn
  the fundamentals of biology. We pursue ambitious goals with
  curiosity and are committed to scientific excellence. Before
  building Latent Labs, our team co-developed DeepMind’s
  Nobel-prize winning AlphaFold, invented latent diffusion,
  and built pioneering lab data management systems as well as
  high throughput protein screening platforms. At Latent Labs
  you will be working with some of the brightest minds in
  generative AI and biology.
  
  Our team is committed to interdisciplinary exchange,
  continuous learning and collaboration. Team offsites help us
  foster a culture of trust across our London and San
  Francisco sites.
  
  We’re looking for innovators passionate about tackling
  complex challenges and maximizing positive global impact.
  Join us on our moonshot mission.
  
  Who you are
  
  - You have a strong CS or ML educational background. You hold
    a degree (BSc, MSc or PhD) in Computer Science, Machine
    Learning, or a closely related quantitative field. You
    have a solid grounding in software engineering principles
    and modern ML frameworks.
  - You have built systems that access large models via APIs.
    You have significant experience designing, deploying and
    maintaining infrastructure for large-scale model serving
    and have hands-on experience building robust API layers
    around ML models.
  - You are customer-facing and delivery-oriented. You have
    direct experience deploying AI systems for external
    customers. You can translate complex technical concepts
    into clear language for non-technical stakeholders and
    thrive in environments where customer success is the
    primary measure of your work.
  - You are fluent in cloud infrastructure. You have hands-on
    experience with AWS and ideally other major cloud
    platforms (GCP, Azure). You are comfortable with
    containerisation (Docker, Kubernetes), CI/CD pipelines,
    and cloud-native architectures.
  - You are a strong communicator and collaborator. You work
    effectively across functions - with research scientists
    and business executives alike. You are comfortable leading
    technical discussions, writing clear documentation, and
    presenting solutions to senior stakeholders at partner
    organisations.
  - You are mission driven and adaptable. You are passionate
    about making a positive impact on the world, whether it’s
    for patients, customers or beyond. You thrive in a
    dynamic, fast-paced environment where priorities can shift
    and you need to context-switch between multiple customer
    engagements.
  
  What sets you apart
  
  - You have experience with bio or protein design models. You
    have worked on ML-driven projects in computational
    biology, protein design, or related life science domains.
    You understand the unique data challenges and evaluation
    paradigms of biological modelling.
  - You have contributed to generative modelling innovation. You
    have a track record of novel contributions to generative
    modelling - whether through publications, open-source
    work, or impactful product features.
  - You have built production enterprise software. You have
    experience delivering software that meets enterprise-grade
    requirements for security, compliance, auditability and
    uptime. You understand the difference between a prototype
    and a production system.
  - You have pharma or biotech industry experience. You
    understand the regulatory landscape, data governance
    requirements and scientific workflows common in
    pharmaceutical and biotech organisations.
  
  Your responsibilities
  
  Customer deployment & integration:
  
  - Drive the end-to-end technical deployment of Latent Labs
    models into customer environments, ensuring seamless
    integration with existing scientific and IT
    infrastructure.
  - Design and build production-grade API integrations, data
    pipelines and model-serving infrastructure tailored to
    each customer’s requirements.
  - Work on-site or embedded with pharma and biotech partners to
    scope technical requirements, troubleshoot issues and
    deliver solutions.
  - Ensure deployments meet enterprise standards for security,
    performance and reliability.
  
  Customer advocacy & product feedback:
  
  - Serve as the technical point of contact for assigned
    customers, building trusted relationships with their
    scientific and engineering teams, including spending time
    working on-site at international partner locations as
    needed
  - Gather and synthesise customer feedback, translating it into
    actionable insights for our product, research and platform
    teams.
  - Collaborate with internal teams to shape the product roadmap
    based on real-world deployment learnings.
  - Create technical documentation, integration guides and best-
    practice resources for customers.
  
  Self development:
  
  - Stay on top of the latest developments in ML infrastructure,
    model serving and cloud-native tooling.
  - Gain a strong working understanding of protein and cell
    biology as it relates to our product.
  - Participate in knowledge sharing, e.g. organise and present
    at our internal reading group.
  
  Apply
  
  We offer strongly competitive compensation and benefits
  packages, including:

  - Pension contributions
  - Generous leave policies (including gender neutral parental
    leave)
  - Hybrid working
  - Travel opportunities and more
  
  We also offer a stimulating work environment, and the
  opportunity to shape the future of synthetic biology through
  the application of breakthrough generative models.
  
  We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and we are
  committed to building a team that represents a variety of
