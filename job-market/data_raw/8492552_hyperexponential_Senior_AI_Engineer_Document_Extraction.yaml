  About hyperexponential (hx)
  
  At hyperexponential, we’re building the AI-powered platform
  that enables the world’s most critical decisions in a $7
  trillion industry, which risks to take, and how to price
  them. These are the decisions that shape real-world
  outcomes: whether rockets successfully launch into space,
  autonomous vehicles make it to market, or communities
  recover after major storms.
  
  Until now, insurance has been making billion-dollar
  decisions using outdated tools. We’re changing that. Our
  platform brings together data, AI, and human expertise to
  give insurers the fastest path from submission to decision -
  helping them move faster, act smarter, and take on more risk
  with confidence.
  
  Backed by a16z, Highland Europe, and Battery Ventures, we’re
  scaling globally - already trusted by nearly 50 of the
  world’s largest insurers, with zero churn and billions in
  premiums flowing through hx.
  
  What began as a single product in one market has rapidly
  evolved into a multi-product, multi-territory platform
  powering every stage of pricing and underwriting. AI is at
  the core of what we do - from building the world’s first
  domain-specific AI peer programmer for insurance (think
  GitHub Copilot with a PhD in actuarial science) to shaping
  agentic workflows that reinvent how this industry operates.
  
  What makes hx different is the people who build it. Here,
  impact isn’t tied to title or tenure; it’s defined by the
  challenges you take on and the discipline you bring.
  Surrounded by peers who stretch you, you’ll do the best,
  hardest work of your life in a company engineered to endure.
  
  If that sounds like you, join us in building what comes
  next.
  
  About the AI Ingestion team
  
  AI is central to hx’s ambition to reinvent how insurers move
  from submission to decision. A significant part of that
  challenge begins before pricing even starts: transforming
  messy, inconsistent, insurance-specific documents into
  structured, reliable data that underwriters can trust. The
  AI Ingestion team owns this critical first mile.
  
  Within this team, we build and scale document extraction and
  data transformation systems tailored to the complexity of
  specialty insurance. We operate at the intersection of large
  language models, classical document understanding
  techniques, evaluation-driven design, and production-grade
  infrastructure. Our outputs directly determine whether
  insurers can automate workflows across multiple lines of
  business with confidence.
  
  As a Senior AI Engineer focused on Document Extraction, you
  will take ownership of solving high-stakes, insurance-
  specific extraction problems. Over the next 6 to 12 months,
  your mission will be to automate key data extraction and
  cleansing workflows across core specialty lines, hitting
  strict accuracy and consistency benchmarks while ensuring
  our systems are robust, observable, and built to scale.
  
  What you’ll be doing
  
  - Designed and delivered high-accuracy document extraction
    pipelines that automated key data capture across multiple
    specialty lines of business, enabling measurable
    reductions in manual processing during customer go-live.
  - Built and productionised data cleansing and manipulation
    capabilities within our ingestion system, improving
    consistency and reliability of downstream pricing inputs.
  - Defined and enforced rigorous evaluation-driven development
    practices, creating robust evaluation sets and benchmarks
    that guided model and pipeline improvements.
  - Improved our evaluation infrastructure for complex ingestion
    scenarios, enabling faster iteration cycles and clearer
    visibility into performance trade-offs.
  - Partnered directly with customers during go-live, diagnosing
    and resolving integration bottlenecks and production
    issues to ensure smooth technical rollouts.
  - Led technical deep-dives and brainstorming sessions to
    unblock complex extraction challenges, raising the bar on
    experimentation, knowledge sharing, and solution design
    across the team.
  
  What you’ll need to have done
  
  - Built and deployed document extraction or document
    understanding systems that achieved measurable accuracy
    improvements in production environments.
  - Designed evaluation frameworks and datasets that enabled
    rigorous, repeatable measurement of model or pipeline
    performance.
  - Delivered data processing or transformation systems that
    were scalable, observable, and maintainable under real-
    world load.
  - Taken end-to-end ownership of complex AI features, from
    problem framing and experimentation through to production
    rollout and monitoring.
  - Collaborated across engineering, product, and customer-
    facing teams to ship solutions that solved real user
    problems rather than isolated research challenges.
  - Raised technical standards within your team by improving
    experimentation practices, documentation, or review
    processes beyond what was originally expected.
  
  You’re unlikely to thrive here if
  
  - You prefer clearly defined, static problem statements over
    ambiguous, evolving real-world challenges.
  - You optimise for elegant prototypes rather than production-
    grade systems that must endure.
  - You are uncomfortable taking full ownership of outcomes,
    including customer impact and operational reliability.
  - If reading our Culture Document leaves you feeling neutral
    rather than energised, hx may not be the place where
    you’ll do your best work. We’re building something that
    asks for commitment and conviction, and we want you to
    feel excited by the opportunity to grow with us.
  
  Compensation
  
  At hx, we’re committed to salary transparency. You’ll always
  have clarity on pay early in the process - our Talent
  Partner will share details with you during initial
  conversations - and we’re working towards publishing salary
  information for all roles globally.
  
  Because we’re building at the intersection of
  technology/SaaS and insurance, our roles don’t always map
  neatly onto traditional benchmarks. Our approach is to
  design compensation that’s competitive in the market, fair
  across teams, and aligned with the impact our people make.
  
  Equity: We offer equity across all roles at hx, making it a
  significant component of total compensation. Your talent
  partner will be able to share more details about this.
