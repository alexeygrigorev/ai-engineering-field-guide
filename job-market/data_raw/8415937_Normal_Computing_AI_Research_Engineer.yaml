  Normal Computing | Incredible Opportunities
  
  The Normal Team builds foundational software and hardware
  that help move technology forward - supporting the
  semiconductor industry, critical AI infrastructure, and the
  broader systems that power our world. We work as one team
  across New York, San Francisco, Copenhagen, Seoul, and
  London. Your Role in Our Mission:
  
  We’re hiring an AI Researcher / AI Research Engineer to push
  the frontier of agentic LLMs and reinforcement learning for
  our agentic code generation tool, nectar. You’ll design and
  run experiments, build agents, curate datasets from complex
  technical documents (e.g., chip specifications), and create
  rigorous evaluations. You’ll write production‑quality
  research code and work closely with engineering to ship
  improvements to customers. Leadership not required—impact
  through research and building is.
  
  Responsibilities:
  
  - Design and implement multi‑agent and RL approaches for
    agentic code generation and tool‑use.
  - Build research prototypes that integrate with nectar;
    collaborate to productionize wins.
  - Create evaluation suites: task specs, pass/fail checkers,
    coverage, cost/latency dashboards.
  - Acquire and curate datasets from PDFs/logs/tables; generate
    synthetic data where appropriate; maintain data cards and
    licensing.
  - Analyze experiments with disciplined ablations; document
    results and decisions.
  - Stay current on LLM agents, RL (offline/online, RLHF/RLAIF),
    constrained decoding, and program synthesis.
  
  What Makes You A Great Fit:
  
  - PhD in CS/AI/ML (or equivalent research experience) with
    publications ideally in multi‑agent RL, agentic AI, or RL
    for language/code.
  - Strong Python and ML framework experience (PyTorch
    preferred; JAX/HF a plus).
  - Demonstrated ability to turn research into working systems;
    reproducibility mindset (tests, seeds, configs, logging).
  - Experience designing eval harnesses and success metrics for
    sequential/agentic tasks.
  - Comfortable with data acquisition/curation from
    documents/logs; good instincts about data quality and
    licenses.
  
  Bonus Points For:
  
  - Research on program synthesis/codegen, constrained decoding,
    or execution‑based rewards.
  - Experience with offline RL from tool traces or human
    corrections.
  - Open‑source contributions (e.g., CleanRL, RLlib, AutoGen,
    LangGraph, CrewAI, Transformers).
  - Familiarity with semiconductor/chip domains or other complex
    technical specs.
  - Track record of shipping research to production and
    measuring impact.
