description: |
  Ema is building the agentic AI operating system for
  enterprises. We help some of the world’s largest
  organizations transform deeply manual, brittle business
  processes into reliable, measurable, production-grade
  automated systems using AI agents, integrations, and human-
  in-the-loop UX. At Ema, success means real workflows running
  in production, used daily by business teams, with measurable
  outcomes.
  
  We’re founded by leaders from Google, Coinbase, and Okta,
  backed by top-tier investors, and scaling rapidly. As we
  grow, we’re building a team of engineers who don’t just ship
  code — they own outcomes.
  
  Customer Value Engineering is Ema’s forward-deployed,
  production-focused engineering group. CVE engineers sit at
  the intersection of Applied AI systems, real customer
  business processes and enterprise-grade reliability,
  security, and integrations.
  
  In this role you will work directly with customers and
  internal product/engineering teams to design, build, deploy,
  and improve agentic systems that actually move business
  metrics. If you want to move beyond demos and prototypes and
  learn how real AI systems behave in production this role is
  ideal for you.
  
  What You’ll Work On
  
  - Design agentic workflows that map customer business
    processes to multi-agent systems with clear success
    criteria
  - Build and deploy AI applications using Ema’s platform:
    agents, tools, integrations, human-in-the-loop workflows
  - Implement integrations with enterprise systems (CRM,
    ticketing, data stores, internal APIs)
  - Debug production issues across the stack — model behavior,
    orchestration logic, permissions, data quality, UX
  - Run evaluations using golden datasets- test data generation,
    offline tests, regression checks, and real user feedback
  - Collaborate closely with customers (Ops, IT, business users)
    to deliver measurable value post launch
  - Partner with Product & Core Engineering to feed learnings
    back into the platform and improve reusability
  
  Who you are
  
  - 3+ years of production software engineering experience
  - At least one real production deployment of a GenAI/LLM-
    powered system (not just POCs)
  - Strong programming skills in Python and/or TypeScript
  - Practical experience with prompt and instruction design
    beyond basics , Tool/function calling and structured
    outputs
  - Practical experience with Retrieval and grounding (RAG,
    embeddings, chunking strategies)
  - Practical experience with Human-in-the-loop workflows and
    safe rollout patterns
  - Practical experience with validation techniques (golden
    sets, offline evals, error analysis)
  - Experience integrating with enterprise systems via APIs
    (REST/JSON), auth (OAuth, service accounts)
  - Comfort working with real customer data and operational
    constraints
  - Clear written and verbal communication with technical and
    non-technical stakeholders
