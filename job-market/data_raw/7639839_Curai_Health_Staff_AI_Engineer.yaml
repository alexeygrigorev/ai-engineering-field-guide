  AI at Curai
  
  At Curai, we believe that access to high-quality healthcare
  is a fundamental human right, not a privilege. Our mission
  is to radically transform healthcare delivery by harnessing
  the power of artificial intelligence and clinical expertise
  to make care more affordable, accessible, and effective for
  everyone.  Patients interact with advanced AI systems at
  every step of their care and follow-up. Licensed physicians
  review each case with the patient for the clinical decision
  in our integrated virtual clinic.
  
  We ground our approach in rigorous research, continuous
  learning, and a deep commitment to clinical integrity. We
  focus on making a real impact: improving health outcomes,
  expanding access to care, and setting new standards for what
  trustworthy, patient-centered healthcare is. Read some of
  our latest publications.
