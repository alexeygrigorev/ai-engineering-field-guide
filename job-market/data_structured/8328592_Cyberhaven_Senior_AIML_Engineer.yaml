    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role requires hands-on production experience with large-
      scale foundational models, transformer architectures, and AI
      agents. The engineer will deploy, monitor, and iterate on
      GenAI systems while operationalizing AI prototypes into
      production services.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect, build, and optimize highly scalable and fault-tolerant systems that
    process large graph datasets at enterprise scale, handling billions of events
    in real time from tens of thousands of endpoints with sub-second latency
  - Solve real-world performance and reliability problems through deep analysis, profiling,
    and systematic troubleshooting in high-throughput distributed environments
  - Develop and evolve a microservices-based architecture using technologies such
    as Go, Kubernetes, Docker, and Redis in a continuously improving production stack
  - Write hardened, security-first code capable of safely processing untrusted data
    and resisting real-world attack vectors across large-scale internet-facing systems
  - Partner with research and product teams to operationalize AI prototypes, turning
    experimental models into robust, scalable, and production-ready services
  - Build AI agents and orchestration workflows using frameworks such as LangChain,
    LangGraph, Genkit, or similar technologies
  use_cases:
  - Process and analyze billions of workflow events in real-time from tens of thousands
    of endpoints to understand data movement and detect security risks
  - Deploy and scale AI-powered data lineage systems that track data across organizations
    to identify sensitive information and potential threats
  - Operationalize large language models and AI agents for data security applications,
    including automated risk detection and threat prevention
  - Enable real-time data loss prevention through AI analysis of enterprise workflows
    and data patterns
  - Provide enterprise-grade security monitoring and threat detection at sub-second
    latency across massive datasets
