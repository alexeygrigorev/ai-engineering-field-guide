position:
  title: 'Senior Principal Research Engineer: AEC Geometric Data - Generative AI'
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a data engineering role focused on building scalable
      data pipelines for ML systems. While the role supports
      generative AI initiatives by preparing data, the actual work
      involves transforming geometric data, pipeline architecture,
      and data preprocessing rather than building, training, or
      fine-tuning models directly. The role aligns data formats
      for downstream LLM training but is not hands-on with the
      models themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead development of scalable data pipelines for diverse AEC data sources in production
    ML systems
  - Design preprocessing and augmentation techniques for large-scale multi-modal datasets
    including text and geometric data
  - Transform unstructured AEC data into representations suitable for machine learning
  - Collaborate with ML Research Scientists and Engineers to align data formats with
    LLM training and fine-tuning
  - Architect and optimize pipelines for scalability, reproducibility, and cloud deployment
  - Drive technical decision-making and influence engineering best practices across
    the team
  - Mentor junior engineers and provide technical guidance on complex data engineering
    challenges
  - Participate in technical planning and roadmap development
  use_cases:
  - Generative AI tools for AEC design and engineering workflows
  - Geometric data modeling and processing for 2D/3D representations
  - Foundation models for Architecture, Engineering, and Construction industry
  - AEC data format transformation including BIM, IFC, CAD, and drawing sets
  - MEP systems data processing (HVAC, electrical, plumbing)
  - AI-enhanced design workflows in AutoCAD, Revit, and Construction Cloud
