      The role is primarily a Staff Software Engineer focused on
      Java full-stack development for payment systems at Visa.

      deploying AI models.

  - Design code and systems that touch 40% of the world population while influencing
    Visa's internal standards for scalability, security, and reusability
  - Collaborate multi-functionally to create design artifacts and develop best-in-class
    software solutions for multiple Visa technical offerings
  - Design, implement and evolve highly scalable and fault-tolerant distributed components
    using functional programming paradigm
  - Design, document and implement new systems, as well as enhancements and modifications
    to existing software with code that complies with design specifications and meets
    security and Java best practices
  - Design and implement testing procedures for APIs, abstractions and integration
    patterns to solve challenging distributed computing problems
  - Review code and accountability for team's development/testing activities and technically
    lead software engineering teams
