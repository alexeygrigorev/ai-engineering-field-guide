      The role involves hands-on work building AI workflows,
      implementing LLM integrations, designing scoped agent
      workflows with tool/function calling, and productionizing AI
      systems on Azure infrastructure. This is direct work ON AI
      systems (agents, LLMs, guardrails) rather than just
      supporting infrastructure or data pipelines.
  responsibilities:
  - Build end-to-end workflow implementations from requirements to production including
    APIs, services, orchestration, and integrations
  - Integrate AI capabilities into products and internal tools including LLM calls,
    tool/function calling, guardrails, evaluations, and response structuring
  - Design and implement scoped agent workflows with clear boundaries, tools, permissions,
    fallbacks, and measurable outcomes
  - Collaborate with vendors to deliver ROI-focused use cases by defining interfaces,
    validating delivery quality, and productionizing outputs
  - Establish strong observability through structured logging, tracing, metrics, dashboards,
    alerting, and runbooks
  - Partner with data teams on Data Lake access patterns, workflows, metadata, governance,
    and reliability
  use_cases:
  - AI workflows across business use cases and product integrations
  - Internal data intelligence using Data Lake
  - Scoped agent workflows with tool use capabilities
  - Enterprise AI systems integrated with Microsoft Graph and identity/API permissioning
  - Production-grade AI systems with observability and monitoring
