  focus: AI-native IT Service and Configuration Management
position:
  title: AI Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is hands-on building and deploying AI systems -
      the responsibilities explicitly include "research,
      prototype, and productionize machine learning models" and
      "experiment with LLMs, embeddings, and retrieval-augmented
      generation (RAG)." The engineer is directly working on
      models, training/inference pipelines, and optimization, not
      just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Research, prototype, and productionize machine learning models for ITSM use cases
    including ticket triage, incident prediction, workflow recommendations, and CMDB
    inference
  - Build scalable training and inference pipelines that integrate seamlessly into
    the core platform
  - Experiment with LLMs, embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for
    IT knowledge and workflow automation
  - Partner with engineers and product managers to define AI-first features that differentiate
    the platform
  - Evaluate performance, optimize models, and ensure reliability, scalability, and
    cost-efficiency of AI systems
  - Stay current with advances in machine learning, LLMs, and AI infrastructure and
    apply them pragmatically
  use_cases:
  - Natural language understanding and processing of IT support tickets for automated
    triage and routing
  - Dynamic knowledge extraction from IT infrastructure data to build and maintain
    configuration management databases
  - Intelligent workflow automation that recommends and executes IT service management
    processes based on historical patterns
  - Predictive insights from complex IT infrastructure data for incident forecasting
    and proactive issue resolution
  - IT ticket classification and prioritization using machine learning models to improve
    service desk efficiency
