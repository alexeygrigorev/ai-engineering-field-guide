    reasoning: |-
      This is a Systems Software Engineer role focused on AI
      infrastructure and SRE fundamentals. The role builds
      tooling, frameworks, and observability systems that support
      AI training workflows, but does not involve building,
      training, or deploying ML models directly. It enables AI
      work through infrastructure and platform support rather than
      hands-on model development.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and maintain large-scale systems supporting frontier model training for
    AI Infrastructure across global public and private clouds
  - Collaborate on tooling for HPC, GPU Training, and AI Model training workflows
  - Build tools and frameworks to improve observability, define actionable reliability
    metrics, and enable fast issue resolution
  - Establish frameworks for operational maturity, lead sustainable incident response
    protocols, and conduct blameless postmortems
  - Implement SRE fundamentals including incident management, monitoring, and performance
    optimization with automation tools
  - Work with engineering teams to deliver innovative solutions, uphold high standards
    for code and infrastructure, and contribute to hiring
  use_cases:
  - Frontier model training infrastructure at scale
  - HPC and GPU training workflow support
  - AI model training observability and reliability monitoring
  - Distributed systems operations with high availability requirements
  - Cloud-based AI infrastructure management across multiple providers
