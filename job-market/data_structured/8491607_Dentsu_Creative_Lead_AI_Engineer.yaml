      This role requires hands-on experience building LLM
      applications, fine-tuning models, implementing RAG systems,
      and deploying AI solutions. The responsibilities directly
      involve model development, agentic frameworks, and
      production deployment of AI systems, which are core ai-first
      activities.
  responsibilities:
  - Build conversational and multimodal AI applications using LLMs and frameworks
    such as LangChain, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, or similar
  - Design AI workflows incorporating reasoning, planning, tool-use, memory, grounding,
    and external system integrations
  - Transform models into scalable APIs and microservices using Python, FastAPI/Flask,
    and Docker
  - Deploy and monitor ML/AI systems in AWS/Azure/GCP, optimizing for cost, latency,
    and reliability
  - Build and optimize transformer-based and multimodal models using deep learning
    frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow
  - Implement fine-tuning, alignment (RLHF/RLAIF), LoRA/QLoRA, pruning, and model
    evaluation pipelines
  - Develop information retrieval systems including hybrid dense-sparse retrieval,
    ranking, knowledge graphs, and relevance optimization
  - Mentor junior engineers and contribute to internal best practices, reusable components,
    and R&D initiatives
  use_cases:
  - Intelligent agents for customer engagement automation
  - Multimodal conversational experiences for brand interactions
  - Personalization systems for customer engagement
  - Knowledge-grounded AI solutions using retrieval augmented generation
  - Enterprise-grade knowledge graph applications
  - Multi-turn multilingual dialogue systems for global brands
