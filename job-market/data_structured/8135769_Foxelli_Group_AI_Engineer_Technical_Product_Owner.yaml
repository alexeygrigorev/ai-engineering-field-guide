      The role involves building an internal AI ad engine that
      generates creative copy for Meta ads, learns from
      performance data, and gets smarter over time. The engineer
      will work directly with LLMs, design feedback loops, and
      build the full backend system - this is hands-on work
      building and deploying AI systems, not supporting
      infrastructure or general software engineering for an AI
      company.
  responsibilities:
  - Build the full backend for the internal AI ad engine system
  - Design how creative elements (hooks, angles, formats, personas) get combined,
    tested, and improved
  - Set up clear feedback loops using Meta ad performance data to optimize the system
  - Make architectural decisions about workflows, queues, callbacks, and system logic
  - Collaborate with editors to understand requirements for day-to-day creative work
  - Choose the MVP development path - build small, test fast, iterate often
  - Maintain simple and scalable system architecture as the product grows
  use_cases:
  - Generate advertising copy for Meta ads using LLMs
  - Test creative variations at scale by combining hooks, angles, formats, and personas
  - Learn from Meta ad performance data to improve creative generation over time
  - Automate repetitive creative work for marketing teams
  - Provide an internal tool that helps D2C brands optimize their advertising performance
