      This is a Full-Stack Engineer role with primary
      responsibilities in React front-end and Node.js/Express
      back-end development. While the role involves integrating AI
      and LLM capabilities (like GPT), the core work is building
      and maintaining web applications that consume AI services
      rather than directly building, training, fine-tuning, or
      deploying models.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and maintain robust front-end applications using React
  - Build and optimize back-end services and APIs with Node.js and Express
  - Integrate AI and LLM capabilities into the platform to enhance functionality
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design, and ship new features
  - Ensure the responsiveness and performance of applications across devices
  - Implement security best practices and data protection measures
  use_cases:
  - Talent data organization and management for enterprises
  - Unbiased, predictive talent acquisition and hiring decisions
  - Automated talent intelligence across the entire talent lifecycle
  - AI-powered evaluation of candidates based on merit rather than bias
