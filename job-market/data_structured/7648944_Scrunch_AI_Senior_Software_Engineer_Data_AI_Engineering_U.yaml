      This is a full stack data engineering role focused on
      building data pipelines, analytics APIs, and infrastructure
      that processes data for LLM-based products, not directly
      building, training, or fine-tuning models. The role involves
      using LLMs as tools for classifiers, extractors, and
      summarizers, but the primary work is on data infrastructure
      and pipelines supporting AI applications.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and maintain data pipelines including batch and streaming/interactive processing
  - Develop web APIs with proper authentication, authorization, caching, and rate
    limiting
  - Work with relational databases like PostgreSQL and analytical platforms like Snowflake/BigQuery
  - Implement LLM-based and traditional ML tools for classification, data extraction,
    and summarization
  - Create full-stack features including data connectors, notifications, alert emails,
    and scheduled reports
  - Ensure data quality by validating source data and output data throughout processing
    pipelines
  use_cases:
  - Help brands optimize their presence on AI search and conversational agent platforms
    like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini
  - Enable marketing teams to discover how their products and services are surfaced
    on AI platforms
  - Process and analyze large datasets using LLMs and traditional analytics methods
  - Build tools to assess and improve accuracy of AI-based classification and summarization
    tasks
  - Provide analytics APIs and scheduled reporting for customer insights in the AI
    era
