      The role involves hands-on work with LLMs including fine-
      tuning, implementing RAG methodologies, and developing
      machine learning solutions using the LangChain framework.
      This is direct work ON AI/ML models, not supporting
      infrastructure or adjacent roles.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and implement machine learning solutions using LLMs
  - Utilize the Langchain framework for working with closed source and open source
    models
  - Apply fine-tuning methodologies to optimize machine learning models for specific
    tasks and datasets
  - Write clean, maintainable, and efficient code adhering to PEP8 standards
  - Utilize containerization technologies such as Docker for development and deployment
  - Work on traditional machine learning methods like XGBoost for classification tasks
    and unsupervised learning techniques like K-means
  use_cases:
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for language model optimization
  - Fine-tuning LLMs for specific healthcare tasks and datasets
  - Classification tasks using traditional ML methods
  - Unsupervised learning with clustering techniques
  - Healthcare outcome optimization through AI solutions
