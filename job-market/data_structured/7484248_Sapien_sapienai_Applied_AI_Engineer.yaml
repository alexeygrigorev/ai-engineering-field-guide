position:
  title: Applied AI Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work building AI agents that
      power autonomous finance operations, including implementing
      agent architectures, library learning systems, semantic
      search, RL and fine-tuning pipelines, and deploying these
      systems to production. This is direct work on AI/ML systems
      - building, deploying, and optimizing agent capabilities
      rather than supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement agent architectures with observability, human-in-the-loop
    verification, and context control for financial workflows
  - Build library learning systems that reduce LLM dependencies by learning reusable
    patterns for planning and code generation
  - Create graph-based company representations and develop efficient search methods
    using embeddings and semantic clustering
  - Build multi-modal parsers that unify diverse financial data sources into queryable
    schemas for agent reasoning
  - Implement RL and fine-tuning pipelines based on user feedback to improve agent
    performance over time
  - Design benchmarking and evaluation suites that quantify accuracy, reliability,
    and business impact across customer workflows
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous CFO system that runs company financials end-to-end with real-time analysis
  - AI-powered detection and prevention of costly financial errors in traditional
    business operations
  - Automated analysis of complex financial workflows in manufacturing, healthcare,
    and restaurant industries
  - Multi-modal financial data parsing and unification from Excel, ERPs, and CRMs
    into queryable formats
  - Agent-based financial decision support that surfaces value and increases decision
    cadence
