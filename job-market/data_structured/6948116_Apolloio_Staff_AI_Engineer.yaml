      This role involves building and productionizing AI systems
      powered by LLMs and intelligent agents, including AI
      Assistant, Autonomous Agents, and Deep Research Agents. The
      engineer will work directly on multi-agent systems, LLM
      chaining, prompt engineering, and deploying customer-facing
      LLM-powered products, which is hands-on AI/ML systems
      development.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and deploy production LLM systems that serve millions of users with high
    availability and performance requirements
  - Create sophisticated AI agents that chain multiple LLM calls, integrate with external
    APIs, and maintain state across complex workflows
  - Develop and optimize prompting strategies, understand trade-offs between prompt
    engineering vs fine-tuning, and implement advanced prompting techniques
  - Build robust APIs and integrate AI capabilities with existing Apollo infrastructure
    and external services
  - Implement comprehensive evaluation frameworks, A/B testing, and monitoring systems
    to ensure AI systems meet accuracy, safety, and reliability standards
  - Optimize for cost, latency, and scalability across different LLM providers and
    deployment scenarios
  - Work closely with product teams, backend engineers, and stakeholders to translate
    business requirements into technical AI solutions
  use_cases:
  - AI Assistant that helps sales teams automate research, scoring, and outreach processes
  - Autonomous AI Agents that reason, plan, and execute complex sales workflows
  - Deep Research Agents for conversational assistance and semantic search
  - Search Personalization to improve user experience and relevance
  - AI Power Automation features for personalized email generation
  - Conversational AI for natural language search and query understanding
