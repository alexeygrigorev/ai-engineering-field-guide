    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role explicitly involves building models, working with
      LLMs, RAG, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and model
      evaluation. The engineer will build AI-powered features and
      work directly on machine learning models including real-time
      audio models and natural language models at scale.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and develop machine learning infrastructure, tooling, and models to help
    teams deliver world class experiences
  - Build internal products and platforms to enable teams to incorporate AI into their
    features and customer facing products
  - Build scalable, resilient services to support data integration, event processing,
    and platform extensions
  - Consult with teams to help them understand common patterns, anti-patterns, and
    tradeoffs of machine learning and guide them through creating excellent customer
    experiences
  - Work with stakeholders to translate product goals into actionable engineering
    plans in a cloud environment
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered applications requiring access to large datasets
  - Natural language processing and text analysis at scale
  - Real-time audio processing including transcription, ASR pipelines with interruption
    detection, and speech synthesis
  - B2B multi-tenant applications powered by machine learning
  - Data annotation and labeling for audio or text use cases
