    reasoning: |-
      This is a Full Stack Software Engineer role focused on
      building user-facing features, backend infrastructure, SDKs,
      and serving architecture for an AI company. While the
      company builds autonomous AI agents, the engineer's
      responsibilities are around web development, microservices,
      and making AI agents accessible through UI/APIs rather than
      building, training, or fine-tuning the models themselves.
      The role supports the AI systems through infrastructure and
      application layers but does not work directly on the AI/ML
      models.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and implement serving architecture for distributed systems with focus
    on scalability, observability, and efficiency
  - Design and build components for internal SDKs for services and integrate them
    in collaboration with other developers
  - Write robust and well-documented code, ensuring quality through automated testing
    and continuous integration and deployment
  - Develop and maintain documentation for the platform, including API documentation,
    technical guides, and technical specifications
  - Translate company vision and customer needs into functional and appealing interactive
    applications
  - Conduct code reviews and provide constructive feedback to other members of the
    team
  use_cases:
  - Building intelligent applications and automations (B2B and B2C) powered by the
    SuperNinja agentic AI platform
  - Enabling autonomous AI agents to execute complex tasks end-to-end with full OS
    capabilities
  - Providing user interfaces and backend infrastructure to make AI agents accessible,
    fast, and powerful
  - Creating serving architecture and SDKs that support distributed AI agent systems
