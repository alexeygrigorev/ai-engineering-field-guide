    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves direct work on ML/AI systems, developing
      and extending state-of-the-art methods and architectures,
      integrating cutting-edge ML/AI into production systems for
      semi-autonomous platforms. This is hands-on work building,
      deploying, and evaluating AI models, clearly aligning with
      ai-first classification.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop ML/AI systems leveraging state-of-the-art methods and architectures for
    real-time perception and navigation
  - Design experiments and conduct benchmarks to evaluate and improve performance
    in real-world defense scenarios
  - Collaborate across teams to integrate cutting-edge ML/AI into production systems
    with high robustness requirements
  - Deploy AI software to production including testing, QA, and monitoring for semi-autonomous
    platforms
  - Reimplement and extend research papers on state-of-the-art Deep Learning approaches
    for defense applications
  - Ensure AI systems achieve high generalization and strong robustness against adversarial
    attacks
  use_cases:
  - Real-time localization and navigation for semi-autonomous platforms
  - Perception systems for defense platforms to detect and understand environments
  - Adversarial attack detection and defense mechanisms for deployed AI systems
  - AI capabilities deployment on edge devices with limited compute resources
  - Reinforcement learning applications for autonomous defense operations
