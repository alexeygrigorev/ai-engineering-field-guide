  title: Staff Software Engineer - AI SDK
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role is building an SDK that provides infrastructure
      for AI applications, not building the AI models themselves.
      The engineer creates abstractions and tooling that support
      AI application developers, focusing on reliability, fault
      tolerance, and integration with existing AI frameworks. This
      is enabling infrastructure rather than hands-on model
      development or deployment.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement Temporal AI SDK features supporting a broad variety of frameworks
    and libraries
  - Develop deep understanding of AI application development techniques, including
    emerging approaches and architectures
  - Work with multiple programming languages, primarily Python and TypeScript, to
    build SDK integrations
  - Serve as a domain expert on AI design patterns, collaborating with field staff
    to provide best-practices and canonical examples
  - Work directly with the developer community to debug issues and gather feedback
    on SDK features and APIs
  - Write public technical documentation describing Temporal concepts and APIs for
    AI developers
  use_cases:
  - Building fault-tolerant AI applications with reliable execution for reasoning,
    tool calls, and memory management
  - Implementing human-in-the-loop interactivity and ambient background processing
    for AI workflows
  - Creating distributed systems for complex AI applications with simplified code
    and improved reliability
  - Integrating with leading AI frameworks and libraries to provide durable execution
    foundation
  - Supporting AI applications for companies like OpenAI, Lovable, and Replit
