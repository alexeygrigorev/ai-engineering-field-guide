    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work with LLMs, AI agents, prompt
      optimization, and AI orchestration - directly building and
      improving the AI/ML systems rather than supporting them. The
      engineer will work on improving model quality, LLM
      orchestration, and evaluation frameworks for conversational
      AI agents in healthcare billing.
  responsibilities:
  - Improve models, LLM orchestration, prompt optimizations, evaluation framework,
    and AI infrastructure
  - Enable agent/workflow product engineers with AI capabilities
  - Own and raise the bar on AI quality and end-to-end AI orchestration of modules
  - Work on hardest research problems including making AI agents act more human-like
  - Balance quick experimentation with systematic evaluation of LLM systems
  - Prototype new products and turn them into high quality AI products
  use_cases:
  - Multi-modal RCM (Revenue Cycle Management) agents for healthcare clinics
  - AI agents that interact with insurance agents to collect revenue
  - Healthcare billing systems where AI must pass Turing Test to appear human-like
  - Automating the bridge between healthcare providers and payers
  - Conversational AI for collecting accurate billing information from insurance
