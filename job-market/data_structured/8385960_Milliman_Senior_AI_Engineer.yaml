      This is an AI/ML engineering role that involves hands-on
      work building and deploying ML models, implementing RAG
      systems, and integrating LLMs into production. The role
      requires direct model engineering work including feature
      engineering, inference systems, and GenAI implementation,
      not just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and deploy production ML models and MLOps pipelines
  - Engineer feature-rich solutions for healthcare claims, risk prediction, and population
    health
  - Implement scalable inference systems with proper validation, monitoring, and performance
    tracking
  - Strategically integrate LLMs and Gen AI into analytics products, building RAG
    systems and conversational interfaces
  - Collaborate with engineering, product, and clinical teams to translate business
    needs into AI solutions
  - Ensure models meet clinical accuracy, regulatory compliance, and business credibility
  - Contribute to ML strategy, tooling, and best practices across teams
  use_cases:
  - AI-assistant for healthcare analytics providing conversational interfaces
  - AI-enhanced data validation and quality assurance for healthcare data
  - HCC recapture, risk scoring automation and predictive modeling
  - Claims pattern recognition, fraud detection, and utilization forecasting
  - Member segmentation, risk stratification, and predictive analytics for population
    health
  - Clinical coding, documentation improvement, and insights extraction using NLP
