    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves building and deploying production AI
      systems including RAG infrastructures, vector databases,
      agent frameworks, and LLM serving. The engineer works hands-
      on implementing multi-agent systems, model fine-tuning
      pipelines, and optimizing RAG pipelines, which is direct
      work on AI systems rather than just supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and develop scalable and secure infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines for
    AI solutions
  - Engineer and maintain production-ready RAG infrastructures and Vector Databases
    with efficient retrieval strategies
  - Develop and maintain a highly reliable Model Serving Layer including scalable
    LLM access services
  - Implement and manage standardized Agent Frameworks, multi-agent systems, and autonomous
    decision-making frameworks
  - Engineer and maintain infrastructure and data pipelines for custom model fine-tuning
  - Build observability, logging, and monitoring solutions for AI use cases including
    model performance KPIs, token usage, drift, and hallucination detection
  - Develop and maintain the Howden Enterprise AI Platform including robust security,
    networking, and access strategies
  - Implement FinOps framework for AI use cases with precise cost controls and chargebacks
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise AI solutions used by hundreds of colleagues across the insurance group
  - RAG-based AI systems for information retrieval in commercial insurance domain
  - Multi-agent systems and autonomous decision-making frameworks for business applications
  - Custom model fine-tuning for insurance-specific AI use cases
  - LLM-based services and applications for enterprise insurance workflows
