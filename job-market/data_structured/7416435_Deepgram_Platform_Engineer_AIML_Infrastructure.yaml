    S3 for hybrid environments
  - Develop comprehensive observability stack with monitoring, logging, and tracing
    for platform health
  - Collaborate with AI researchers and ML engineers to build tools and workflows
    that accelerate development
  - Automate the lifecycle of single-tenant, managed deployments
  use_cases:
  - Voice AI platform providing real-time speech-to-text APIs
  - Text-to-speech synthesis and voice agent building
  - Production-grade voice agent deployment at scale
  - Training and deploying voice-native foundation models
  - Self-hosted and on-premises voice AI software solutions
