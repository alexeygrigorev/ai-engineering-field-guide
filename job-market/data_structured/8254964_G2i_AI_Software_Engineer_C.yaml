  title: AI Software Engineer (C)

    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on providing human feedback through code
      comparison, ranking, and refactoring to train LLMs via RLHF.
      The role does not involve building, training, fine-tuning,
      or deploying models - it's about supplying the training
      data/feedback that enables others to improve the models.
  responsibilities:
  - Compare and rank multiple code snippets, explaining which is best and why
  - Repair and refactor AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and style
  - Inject feedback including ratings, edits, and test results into the RLHF pipeline
  - Maintain smooth operation of the RLHF feedback loop
  - Apply strong code-review instincts to spot logic errors, performance traps, and
    security issues
  - Provide clear written explanations justifying why one coding approach is better
    than another
  use_cases:
  - Training large language models to write production-grade code across multiple
    programming languages
  - Generating code rankings and edits to create reward signals for reinforcement
    learning
  - Improving LLM code generation quality through human feedback and expert code review
  - Teaching models to propose, critique, and improve code similar to human engineers
