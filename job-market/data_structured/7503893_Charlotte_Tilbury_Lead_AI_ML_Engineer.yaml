      This is a hands-on AI/ML engineering role with direct
      responsibility for building and deploying AI systems,
      including agentic systems, RAG implementations, and
      production ML pipelines. The role involves designing and
      implementing AI solutions using LangChain, LangGraph, prompt
      engineering, and orchestrating LLM workflows on GCP Vertex
      AI, while also deploying traditional ML systems like
      recommender systems and forecasting models.
  responsibilities:
  - Partner with stakeholders to scope problems and identify the right solution, whether
    leveraging existing AI tools or building custom workflows and solutions
  - Design and implement agentic systems using techniques spanning RAG, grounding,
    prompt engineering, and orchestration on a GCP-first stack
  - Build and maintain production ML pipelines and services for non-GenAI use cases
    including recommender systems, customer segmentation models, and marketing optimisation
    modules
  - Develop APIs and microservices for AI/ML solutions, ensuring security, scalability,
    and observability
  - Implement CI/CD for ML services, write infrastructure as code, and monitor for
    model/data drift and performance
  - Establish robust guardrails for safe AI usage, including prompt security, practical
    evaluation frameworks, and compliance with privacy regulations
  - Drive and evangelize best practices, reusable templates, and documentation to
    scale AI/ML delivery across the business
  - Line manage AI/ML Engineers by setting goals, developing skills, and mentoring
    for high performance
  use_cases:
  - Agentic AI systems with RAG capabilities for business process automation and knowledge
    retrieval
  - Recommender systems for product suggestions and personalization in e-commerce
  - Customer segmentation models using supervised and unsupervised learning approaches
  - Marketing optimisation modules leveraging econometric modelling
  - Forecasting models for business planning and inventory management
