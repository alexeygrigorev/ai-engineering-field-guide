  title: Senior Applied AI Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves direct hands-on work building AI agents
      and LLM-powered systems. The engineer will design and
      implement AI agent features, integrate multiple LLM
      providers, orchestrate multi-step workflows, and implement
      tool/function calling capabilities - all core ai-first work
      building AI systems rather than supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement AI agent features with advanced context management techniques
    including sub-agents, retrieval-based context management, and sliding context
    windows
  - Integrate and evaluate multiple LLM providers (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google
    Gemini) and beta-test new model releases
  - Enable AI agents to call external tools and APIs safely using frameworks like
    Vercel AI SDK and LangGraph for multi-step workflow orchestration
  - Collect and curate datasets from agent responses and multi-turn conversations
    to analyze behavior patterns and derive performance improvements
  - Stay up-to-date with NLP and LLM research, experiment with novel prompting strategies
    and context handling methods, and develop automated evaluation benchmarks
  - Collaborate with engineering teams to deliver production-ready AI features and
    mentor junior engineers on AI development practices
  use_cases:
  - Transform natural language descriptions into production-ready full-stack web and
    mobile applications
  - Enable AI agents to handle complex architectural decisions and maintain context
    across large codebases
  - Orchestrate multi-step AI workflows for intuitive app development experiences
  - Allow users to create, edit, and deploy applications instantly in the browser
    without traditional coding
  - Support both simple UI changes and complex full-stack application modifications
    through AI-powered generation
