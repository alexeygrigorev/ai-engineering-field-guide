      This role is building platforms, infrastructure, and tooling
      that enable other teams to use AI - APIs, orchestration
      frameworks, monitoring systems, and deployment pipelines.
      The focus is on creating the foundational infrastructure
      (platform engineering) for AI solutions rather than directly
      building, training, or fine-tuning models/agents.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build the AI platform that powers LLMs, agents, and other AI solutions
    across Dojo
  - Develop APIs, SDKs, and tooling that allow product teams to consume AI capabilities
    at scale
  - Implement orchestration for multi-model and multi-service workflows using agentic
    frameworks
  - Build and manage vector search and retrieval systems to support RAG and knowledge
    integration
  - Build robust monitoring, logging, and guardrails to ensure AI systems are safe
    and observable
  - Automate infrastructure and model deployment with Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD
    pipelines
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered payment processing and commerce solutions
  - RAG-based knowledge integration systems
  - Agentic workflows for business operations
  - Multi-model AI service orchestration
  - Vector search and retrieval for enterprise applications
