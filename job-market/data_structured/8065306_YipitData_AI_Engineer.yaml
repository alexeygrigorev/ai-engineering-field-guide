      The role focuses on traditional ML/DL development including
      training, fine-tuning, and optimizing models using
      TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn. While NLP is
      mentioned, the emphasis is on standard ML workflows (data
      preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation) rather
      than LLM-specific technologies or GenAI frameworks.
  responsibilities:
  - Assist in the development, training, and fine-tuning of machine learning models
  - Work with large datasets including data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering
  - Implement and optimize deep learning models using frameworks such as TensorFlow,
    PyTorch, or Scikit-learn
  - Support research and development of AI applications in natural language processing
    and predictive analytics
  - Collaborate with software engineers to deploy and integrate AI models into production
    environments
  - Conduct experiments, analyze results, and enhance model performance
  use_cases:
  - Natural language processing applications
  - Predictive analytics for market research
  - Alternative data analysis for actionable insights
  - Data transformation for strategic intelligence
  - ML model deployment for production systems
