  - Design UX patterns for AI interactions including loading states, streaming responses,
    retries, and fallbacks
  - Optimize performance, memory usage, and battery efficiency
  - Capture user signals and feedback to support AI evaluation and iteration
  - Collaborate with backend and ML engineers on API design and system behavior
  - Maintain high App Store quality, stability, and production reliability
  use_cases:
  - Proactive AI system that users rely on daily
  - AI interactions across conversations, tools, and workflows
  - Streaming AI responses in mobile applications
  - On-device ML inference using TensorFlow Lite
