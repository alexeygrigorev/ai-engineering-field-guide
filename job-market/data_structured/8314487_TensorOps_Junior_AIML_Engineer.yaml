      This is a hands-on role working directly on AI/ML systems
      including Generative AI applications (chatbots, agents),
      traditional ML (time series, computer vision), and MLOps.
      The role requires understanding of LLM system design (RAG,
      agents), ML pipelines, and uses LangChain, LangGraph,
      PyTorch, and HuggingFace for model training and serving.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and deploy generative AI applications including chatbots and agents
  - Develop traditional machine learning solutions for time series forecasting, AdTech,
    and computer vision
  - Implement MLOps solutions to improve ML pipelines at scale
  - Design and implement LLM systems using RAG and agent architectures
  - Work with model training and serving using PyTorch, HuggingFace, LightGBM, and
    CatBoost
  - Build Python APIs and data pipelines using FastAPI, Pandas, and Polars
  use_cases:
  - Generative AI chatbots and conversational agents for enterprise clients
  - Time series forecasting for business analytics and planning
  - Computer vision applications for image recognition and analysis
  - AdTech solutions using traditional machine learning methods
  - Scalable MLOps infrastructure for production ML systems deployment
