  title: Principal Engineer – Data and AI
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role is primarily focused on data architecture, data
      engineering, and platform development for power system
      planning. While it mentions identifying and leading AI/ML
      use cases, the core work involves building data
      infrastructure, governance, and integration workflows that
      support others to apply AI, not directly building, training,
      or deploying models.
  responsibilities:
  - Own the end-to-end data architecture and reporting strategy for PlanOS planning
    platform
  - Design and govern data models and schemas for planning inputs, intermediate results,
    and outputs
  - Ensure data versioning, lineage, and reproducibility to support auditable planning
    results
  - Optimize storage and data access patterns for large multi-scenario planning studies
  - Enable clear reporting through dashboards, narratives, and interactive analysis
    tools
  - Identify and lead AI/ML use cases that add value to long-term grid planning
  - Partner with engineering teams to integrate data and AI workflows into production
    software
  - Own data governance, quality assurance, and validation processes
  use_cases:
  - Long-term transmission and generation planning
  - Capacity expansion planning for power systems
  - Reliability assessment of interconnected power grids
  - Scenario analysis for system operators and regulators
  - Production cost modeling and market simulation
  - Steady-state and transient stability simulation
