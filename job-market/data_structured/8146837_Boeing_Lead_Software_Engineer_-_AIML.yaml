    type: ml-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on traditional computer vision and
      perception systems including SLAM, sensor fusion,
      calibration, multi-view geometry, and localization using
      cameras, LiDAR, and IMUs. The work involves implementing
      GPU-enabled solutions for detection, segmentation, and
      localization on embedded platforms, which aligns with
      classical ML/CV rather than generative AI or LLMs.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop innovative perception systems for manufacturing automation, mobile devices,
    cabin features, and flight-deck automation
  - Own end-to-end development of perception pipelines for robotic and mobile platforms
    including mobile robots, hand-held, and airborne systems
  - Implement GPU-enabled solutions for indoor and outdoor localization, mapping,
    detection, and segmentation using cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, and satellite navigation
  - Design perception rigs and associated lifecycle software including calibration
    and health management for field applications
  - Use rapid-prototyping techniques to model and simulate perception systems with
    software and hardware in the loop testing
  - Collaborate with ML teams to produce scalable perception solutions suitable for
    large datasets while minimizing labeling needs
  use_cases:
  - Manufacturing automation and operational efficiency for aircraft fleet operators
  - Mobile robotics platforms with indoor/outdoor localization and mapping capabilities
  - Flight-deck automation and cabin feature perception systems
  - Aircraft lifecycle scenario simulation for potential customers
  - Sensor fusion systems combining cameras, LiDAR, and IMUs for aerospace applications
  - Robotic perception for manufacturing, maintenance, and operations environments
