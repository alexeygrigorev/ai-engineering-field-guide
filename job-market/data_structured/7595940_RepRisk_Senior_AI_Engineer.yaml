      Role involves hands-on building of agentic AI systems, LLM-
      powered microservices, fine-tuning foundation models, and
      implementing autonomous agent architectures including tool-
      use and multi-agent coordination. This is direct work on
      AI/LLM systems, not supporting infrastructure or general
      software engineering.
  responsibilities:
  - Designing and building agentic AI features that leverage memory, planning, and
    tool-use to solve real-world business problems
  - Developing, integrating, and maintaining LLM-powered microservices and pipelines
    as part of broader production applications
  - Fine-tuning foundation models and training custom models for perception, reasoning,
    and decision-making tasks
  - Identifying, testing, and implementing state-of-the-art advancements in LLMs and
    autonomous agent architectures
  - Ensuring robust performance through continuous evaluation, optimization, and A/B
    testing of AI components
  - Collaborating closely with product managers, designers, and domain experts to
    align technical solutions with user needs and business goals
  - Mentoring and guiding team members, fostering a collaborative engineering culture
  - Participating in technical design reviews and code reviews to uphold high engineering
    standards
  use_cases:
  - Agentic AI systems for business problem solving with memory, planning, and tool-use
    capabilities
  - LLM-powered microservices for perception, reasoning, and decision-making tasks
  - Autonomous agent architectures for workflow automation and reasoning-driven applications
  - AI-powered solutions for corporate responsibility and business conduct risk analysis
  - Multi-agent coordination systems for complex business workflows
