      This role involves hands-on work building and deploying LLM-
      powered systems including RAG components, agent workflows,
      and prompt engineering. The engineer directly develops
      generation pipelines, optimizes inference, and integrates
      models into production services.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and refine LLM-powered systems to extract structured medical concepts, diagnoses,
    medications, labs, and timelines from unstructured records
  - Develop generation pipelines that produce clinically accurate drafts of notes
    (H&P, progress notes, discharge summaries, etc.) from factual inputs
  - Design, prototype, and evaluate prompts, agent workflows, and retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG) components
  - Benchmark LLM systems to evaluate new models and audit accuracy
  - Optimize inference cost, latency, and throughput through batching, caching, and
    model-selection strategies
  - Collaborate closely with product and clinical teams to build systems that transform
    medical records into structured insights and clinician-ready documentation
  use_cases:
  - Extract structured medical information (diagnoses, medications, labs, timelines)
    from unstructured electronic health records
  - Generate clinically accurate documentation drafts including H&P notes, progress
    notes, and discharge summaries
  - Proactively draft clinical notes before physician visits to improve care quality
    and reduce documentation burden
  - Surface clinical evidence and recommend diagnoses by reviewing all patient data
    in the EHR
  - Transform diverse EHR data sources into clinician-ready documentation and structured
    insights
