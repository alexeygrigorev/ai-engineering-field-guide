      This is a hands-on engineering role building agentic AI
      solutions with LLMs. The engineer will design, code, deploy,
      and optimize multi-agent workflows, RAG pipelines, and LLM-
      based systems directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Embed AI-first and ML engineering principles into SDLC, ensuring intelligent automation
    and predictive capabilities are considered from design through deployment
  - Design and develop agentic AI solutions for data governance tracking, exception
    detection, reconciliation frameworks, and lifecycle management workflows across
    multiple domains
  - Build intelligent agents that apply rules or adaptive intelligence to automate
    exception handling and reconciliation processes
  - Develop APIs and microservices using Python (FastAPI) and .NET Core for agentic
    workflows
  - Integrate AI workflows with LDX UI components built in Angular for user review
    and configuration
  - Deploy and manage LLMs (Claude, GPT, Amazon Titan) via AWS Bedrock and integrate
    RAG pipelines using LangChain or Haystack
  - Build knowledge bases and embedding models for contextual reasoning using vector
    databases (Pinecone, OpenSearch)
  - Implement event-driven architectures using AWS EventBridge, Lambda, and Step Functions
    for real-time orchestration
  use_cases:
  - Automated data governance tracking and compliance monitoring
  - Exception detection and resolution across multiple data domains
  - Reconciliation frameworks using rule-based and AI-driven logic
  - Lifecycle management workflows for investor and operational domains
  - Intelligent agents for automated exception handling
  - User-configurable AI workflows with intuitive UI components
