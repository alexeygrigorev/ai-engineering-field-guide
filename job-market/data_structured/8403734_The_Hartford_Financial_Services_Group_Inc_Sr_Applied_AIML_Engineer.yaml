  - Design and develop AI/ML solutions to drive transformation and improve processes
    in underwriting, claims, operations, and corporate functions
  - Design, build and maintain scalable Agentic AI systems including multi-agent workflows,
    remote agent orchestration, tool calling, and human-in-the-loop feedback
  - Implement evaluation-driven development harness with grading logic and rubrics
    for evaluating AI agents and tuning for quality, safety, and reliability
  - Build full stack AI agents using latest Agentic AI/UI frameworks and standards
    including A2A, AAIF, A2UI, agent skills, and MCP
  - Develop advanced RAG systems including Agentic RAG and GraphRAG to enhance accuracy
    and relevancy
  - Build scalable, fault-tolerant solutions on AWS and/or GCP in a multi-cloud ecosystem
  - Instrument AI observability using OpenTelemetry and set up offline evaluation,
    drift monitoring, and playbacks
