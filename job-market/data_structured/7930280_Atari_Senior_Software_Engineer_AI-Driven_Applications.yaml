      The role requires hands-on integration and deployment of
      LLMs and machine learning models into production, including
      building RAG systems with embeddings, indexing, and
      retrieval. The engineer directly works on implementing GenAI
      features, optimizing inference performance, and managing
      prompt engineering - all core AI/ML system building
      activities.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement scalable, high-performance architectures for front-end interfaces
    (React, Vue, or Angular) and back-end microservices (Python/Node.js)
  - Build, document, and secure efficient RESTful or GraphQL APIs to enable seamless
    data and model communication across systems
  - Configure and optimize data models in relational databases and non-relational
    Vector Databases to support AI workloads
  - Integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning artifacts into production
    environments with emphasis on latency, reliability, and cost efficiency
  - Lead the design and development of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
    including data chunking, embedding, indexing, and retrieval
  - Improve AI application responsiveness via prompt engineering, caching, and inference
    optimization
  - Develop unit, integration, and end-to-end tests; manage deployment pipelines ensuring
    quality, stability, and reliability
  - Collaborate with Data Scientists and MLOps Engineers to deploy, monitor, and continuously
    improve AI systems in production
  use_cases:
  - AI-driven video game applications and experiences
  - Intelligent user-facing features that enhance product performance and usability
  - Contextual response systems using Retrieval-Augmented Generation
  - Generative AI integration for enhanced interactivity
  - AI-powered product components for gaming experiences
