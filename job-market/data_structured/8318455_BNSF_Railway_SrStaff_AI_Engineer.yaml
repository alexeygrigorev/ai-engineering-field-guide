  title: Sr/Staff AI Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      Role involves hands-on work designing, developing, and
      implementing AI models and algorithms. Requires direct
      experience with GenAI tools (LangChain, LangGraph), vector
      databases, agentic architectures, and fine-tuning models for
      production deployment.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and implement AI models and algorithms tailored to railroad operations
    including predictive maintenance, scheduling, and safety monitoring
  - Build scalable AI systems to analyze real-time data from rail infrastructure,
    rolling stock, and IoT devices
  - Collect, preprocess, and clean data from various sources for training AI models
    and build ETL pipelines for AI applications
  - Fine tune and optimize algorithms to streamline train scheduling, route planning,
    and fuel efficiency
  - Collaborate with software engineers and DevOps teams to integrate AI solutions
    into production environments
  - Monitor deployed models and systems for performance, scalability, and accuracy
    to ensure continuous improvement
  use_cases:
  - Predictive maintenance for rail infrastructure and rolling stock
  - Train scheduling and route planning optimization
  - Safety monitoring and anomaly detection
  - Real-time data analysis from IoT sensors and GPS systems
  - Operational process automation and AI-powered decision making
  - Fuel efficiency optimization through algorithm tuning
