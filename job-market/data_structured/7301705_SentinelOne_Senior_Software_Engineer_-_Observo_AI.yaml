position:
  title: Senior Software Engineer - Observo AI
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building data pipelines and
      infrastructure that process telemetry data using ML models,
      rather than building or fine-tuning the ML models
      themselves. The engineer is responsible for integrating ML-
      driven systems and deploying production ML infrastructure,
      which supports the AI work rather than directly creating the
      AI/LLM models.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement scalable, high-performance data processing pipelines capable
    of handling petabyte-scale telemetry data
  - Build and optimize ML-driven data routing, filtering, and transformation engines
    to reduce customer data volumes by 80%+
  - Develop real-time analytics and anomaly detection systems using advanced machine
    learning techniques and large language models
  - Architect cloud-native microservices and APIs that integrate seamlessly with major
    observability platforms
  - Implement robust monitoring, alerting, and observability solutions for distributed
    systems operating at enterprise scale
  - Optimize system performance, cost efficiency, and reliability through continuous
    profiling, testing, and infrastructure improvements
  use_cases:
  - Telemetry data pipeline optimization for logs, metrics, and traces at petabyte
    scale
  - ML-driven data reduction that decreases customer data volumes by 80%+ while preserving
    critical insights
  - Real-time anomaly detection and analytics using machine learning and large language
    models
  - Integration with enterprise observability platforms like Splunk, Elastic, Datadog,
    and New Relic
  - Cost and performance optimization of enterprise data infrastructure through intelligent
    data processing
