    Building engineering AGI and AI agents for
    industrial/companies
position:
  title: Senior Software Engineer - Agentic AI Platform
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building the platform infrastructure,
      distributed systems, and integration layer that deploys and
      supports the agentic AI system, rather than building the
      AI/ML models themselves. The engineer implements prototypes
      from the AI research team and works on scalability,
      security, and deployment - classic platform engineering that
      enables the AI system rather than developing the models or
      intelligence.
  responsibilities:
  - Collaborate with the team to understand the Archie capability roadmap and decompose
    capabilities into technical development tasks
  - Transform AI research team prototypes and proofs of concept into robust
  - scalable production implementations
  - Diagnose and resolve technical problems reported by the team or end users
  - Develop and execute automated platform tests including traditional software testing
  - agentic AI evaluations
  - and infrastructure testing
  - Enhance Archie's scalability and robustness through system architecture design
    and implementation
  - Integrate with customer information systems and deploy within corporate networks
  use_cases:
  - AI engineer capable of quantitative intuition over physical product domains and
    engineering tool use
  - Design engineering automation that performs at an entry-level engineer level and
    rapidly improves
  - Agentic platform that decomposes performance requirements and develops them into
    design solutions
  - AI system that accesses and uses customer information systems and understands
    physics in product design
  - Deployable AI teammate within corporate networks that can access and process valuable
    engineering data
  - Scalable and responsive AI system that performs the same actions as human engineers
    across industrial companies
