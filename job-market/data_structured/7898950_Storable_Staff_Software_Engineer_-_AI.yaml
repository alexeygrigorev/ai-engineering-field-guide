      This role requires hands-on implementation of LLM
      integration including fine-tuning, RAG, orchestration, agent
      frameworks, and embeddings. The engineer will directly
      build, deploy, and optimize AI systems using OpenAI,
      Anthropic, and Bedrock foundation models rather than just
      supporting AI infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Define and drive the technical vision for AI-powered features and platform components
  - Architect scalable, secure, and resilient backend systems and pipelines
  - Evaluate, design, and implement solutions using OpenAI, Anthropic, and Bedrock
    foundation models
  - Establish best practices for prompt engineering, model evaluation, data flows,
    and AI system reliability
  - Build robust backend services and APIs using Python (FastAPI, Flask, etc)
  - Integrate LLMs into production workflows including fine-tuning, RAG, orchestration,
    agent frameworks, and embeddings
  - Develop cloud-native systems using AWS services such as EKS, Kubernetes, Lambda,
    S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Step Functions, and SageMaker
  - Partner with product managers to translate AI concepts into scalable engineering
    solutions and mentor engineers across teams
  use_cases:
  - AI-enabled products and platform capabilities for property management
  - Integration of LLM-powered features across product ecosystem
  - Production workflows leveraging foundation models for enhanced functionality
  - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementations for intelligent information
    retrieval
  - Agentic workflows for autonomous task execution within property management systems
