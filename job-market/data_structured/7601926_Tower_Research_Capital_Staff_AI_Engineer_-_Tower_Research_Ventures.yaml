      While the role mentions "AI Engineer" and "vertical AI
      applications," the job description lacks specific details
      about actual AI/ML work. The responsibilities focus on
      building core features, infrastructure, and product
      development rather than model building, training, or
      deployment. Without clear indications of hands-on AI/ML
      implementation, it cannot be definitively classified as ai-
      first or ai-support.
  responsibilities:
  - Acting as a 'zero to one' engineer, building out core features and infrastructure
    for new products
  - Establishing and maintaining a technical roadmap for projects
  - Evaluating the technical feasibility and scalability of product features
  - Leading and building out the engineering side of the organization as needed
  - Mentoring and collaborating with new team members as the engineering team grows
  use_cases:
  - Vertical AI applications in portfolio companies
  - Category-defining product development for early-stage ventures
  - Applied AI solutions for startup environments
  - User-facing applications powered by AI technologies
