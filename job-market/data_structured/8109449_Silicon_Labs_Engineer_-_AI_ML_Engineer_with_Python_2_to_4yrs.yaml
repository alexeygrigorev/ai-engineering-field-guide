      The role focuses on RPA (Robotic Process Automation) with
      some AI model development. While AI models are mentioned,
      the core emphasis is on integrating AI with RPA workflows to
      automate business processes rather than building or
      deploying cutting-edge AI/ML systems. The heavy emphasis on
      RPA tools (Automation Anywhere) and workflow automation
      makes this primarily an AI-support role.

  - Design, develop, and deploy AI models using machine learning, deep learning, and
    natural language processing techniques
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to identify opportunities for AI implementation
    and integration into existing systems
  - Optimize and maintain AI models for performance and accuracy while scaling solutions
    as required
  - Work closely with business analysts and stakeholders to gather requirements and
    ensure alignment with business objectives
  - Educate and train team members and end-users on the use of AI and RPA solutions
  - Create and maintain technical documentation related to AI models, RPA processes,
    and deployment plans
  - Generate reports on automation impact and AI performance metrics for management
