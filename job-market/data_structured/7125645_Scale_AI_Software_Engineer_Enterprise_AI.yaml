    reasoning: |-
      The role is building infrastructure/platform for an
      enterprise Generative AI platform that provides APIs for
      knowledge retrieval, inference, and evaluation. While it
      mentions interacting with LLMs, the primary focus is on
      software engineering, scalability, and reliability of the
      platform itself rather than building, training, or fine-
      tuning models. The engineer is enabling AI capabilities
      through product development rather than hands-on model work.
  responsibilities:
  - Own large new areas within the Scale Generative AI Platform product
  - Work across backend, frontend, and interacting with LLMs and ML models
  - Deliver experiments at high velocity and quality to engage customers
  - Manage the entire product lifecycle from conceptualization through production
  - Solve hard engineering problems in scalability and reliability
  - Multi-task and quickly learn new technologies in a fast-paced environment
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise-grade knowledge retrieval using Generative AI
  - LLM inference and evaluation at scale
  - Building APIs for AI model interactions
  - Enabling enterprises to deploy and oversee AI applications
  - Providing high-quality data and full-stack technologies for AI models
