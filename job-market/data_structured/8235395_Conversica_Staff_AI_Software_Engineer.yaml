    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work building AI systems
      directly - designing and implementing agentic systems, LLM-
      powered applications with tool use and retrieval, and
      production AI infrastructure. The engineer will own AI
      architecture decisions, deploy LLM applications to
      production, and work on agent evaluation, orchestration
      patterns, and guardrails. This is clearly working ON AI
      systems, not just supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, implement, and ship AI-driven features and systems into production environments
  - Own technical decision-making for AI architecture, data modeling, and system integration
  - Partner closely with Product, Engineering, and other stakeholders to translate
    business needs into scalable technical solutions
  - Identify and address reliability, scalability, performance, and observability
    challenges in AI systems
  - Establish and evolve best practices for applied AI engineering, including agent
    evaluation, interpretability, and reliability
  - Mentor and guide other engineers, raising the bar on AI engineering quality and
    decision-making
  - Contribute to technical strategy and roadmap discussions related to AI capabilities
    and overall platform evolution
  use_cases:
  - Agentic system design with orchestration, tool use, state/memory, and multi-step
    workflows
  - LLM-powered applications for customer engagement and business communication
  - Quality evaluation systems with harnesses, regression tests for prompts/agents,
    and online/offline metrics
  - Guardrails for hallucination mitigation, grounding, HITL review, and safe degradation
    paths
  - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with indexing, freshness, and data layer
    design
