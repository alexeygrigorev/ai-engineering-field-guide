    type: ml-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role focuses on GPU-accelerating ML algorithms, HPC
      workloads, and financial computing applications. This
      involves performance optimization and parallel programming
      for ML workloads but does not involve building, training,
      fine-tuning, or deploying models like an AI-first role. The
      work is about optimizing existing ML algorithms on GPU
      hardware rather than developing the models themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Research and develop techniques to GPU-accelerate high-performance workloads at
    the intersection of AI and financial markets
  - Perform in-depth analysis and optimization of complex AI and HPC workloads on
    modern CPU and GPU architectures
  - Publish and present discovered optimization techniques in developer blogs or relevant
    conferences
  - Influence the design of next-generation hardware architectures, software, and
    programming models through collaboration with NVIDIA teams
  use_cases:
  - Stock market prediction and financial forecasting
  - Fraud detection in financial transactions
  - Portfolio optimization and selection
  - Pricing and risk simulation algorithms
  - Systematic and algorithmic trading strategies
  - Monte Carlo simulations for financial modeling
