  - Own projects end-to-end including technical design, architecture decisions, scoping,
    delivery, iteration, and ongoing support
  - Build reliable, scalable systems used across the organization that touch critical
    parts of TRM's operations
  - Collaborate with non-technical stakeholders to expand understanding of AI possibilities
    and shape ambitious solutions
