      This role involves hands-on building and deploying AI/ML
      systems including LLMs, CV/NLP models, and document
      intelligence systems. The engineer owns the end-to-end
      lifecycle from model development to production deployment,
      not just supporting infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Build generalizable models for tax documents using CV/NLP/LLMs and embeddings
    for dynamic, context-aware parsing
  - Improve native-PDF/text-layer matching, anomaly detection, and prior-year-aware
    checks with human-in-the-loop flows
  - Productionize low-latency training and inference pipelines over millions of documents
    with observability and drift monitoring
  - Integrate LLMs and traditional ML models into robust, auditable workflows for
    tax determination and document processing
  - Build and maintain data pipelines, feature extraction, and preprocessing for tax-relevant
    data
  - Develop and integrate RESTful APIs and microservices to expose AI capabilities
    to internal and external systems
  - Lead design reviews, perform code reviews, and mentor mid-level and junior engineers
    on AI best practices
  use_cases:
  - Automate tax document processing by scanning, organizing, and extracting data
    from workpapers
  - Enable data export to tax software at scale through the 1040SCAN product
  - Move beyond fixed OCR templates to dynamic, context-aware parsing of tax documents
  - Provide native-PDF and text-layer matching with anomaly detection for quality
    verification
  - Support tax determination through rules-based automation and AI-powered workflows
