    reasoning: |-
      This is a Founding AI Engineer role with direct hands-on
      work on AI systems: architecting RAG pipelines, building
      agent-based systems, fine-tuning LLMs, and implementing LLM-
      powered workflows. The role explicitly involves model fine-
      tuning and working with orchestration tools, which is core
      AI development rather than support infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and scale RAG pipelines, agent-based systems, and LLM-powered workflows
  - Fine-tune large language models for structured data extraction and automation
  - Build developer-friendly APIs and interfaces for web automation
  - Ship product features rapidly with real usage and feedback from customers
  - Work closely with product, design, and customers to build high-impact features
  - Stay ahead of the curve on LLM tools, embeddings, orchestration, and training
    techniques
  use_cases:
  - AI employees that automate tedious manual business processes
  - AI-powered workflows that help businesses scale with smaller human teams
  - Structured data extraction and automation using fine-tuned LLMs
  - Web automation interfaces accessible from web to mobile devices
  - Agent-based systems that manage and execute business workflows
