      This role focuses on building agentic AI systems, autonomous
      agents, and LLM-based applications using RAG architectures
      and multi-agent systems. The engineer is directly
      responsible for designing, developing, and deploying
      production-grade AI solutions with Azure OpenAI, not just
      supporting infrastructure or data pipelines for AI teams.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and develop sophisticated agentic AI systems capable of autonomous decision-making
    and task execution
  - Architect and implement production-grade AI solutions using Azure services including
    Azure Functions, Azure OpenAI, and Azure Cognitive Services
  - Build and maintain CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions for automated
    testing and deployment
  - Develop scalable data processing workflows using Azure Databricks and Apache Spark
  - Implement comprehensive testing strategies for AI applications including unit
    tests, integration tests, and performance testing
  - Optimize AI agent performance, reliability, and cost-efficiency in production
    environments
  - Design and implement monitoring, logging, and observability solutions for AI systems
  - Mentor junior engineers and lead technical discussions on AI architecture and
    best practices
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate AI agents into existing systems
  - Implement security best practices including managed identities, Key Vault integration,
    and RBAC
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous AI agents for decision-making and task execution
  - RAG-based knowledge retrieval and generation systems
  - Large-scale data processing and ML workflows with Databricks and Spark
  - Multi-agent systems for complex problem-solving
  - Enterprise-grade AI solutions deployed on Azure cloud infrastructure
