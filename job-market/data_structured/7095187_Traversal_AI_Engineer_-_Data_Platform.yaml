  stage: Series A
  focus: AI-powered SRE and incident remediation platform
position:
  title: AI Engineer - Data Platform
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      The role is on the Data Platform/Infrastructure team
      building backend systems, data pipelines, and observability
      infrastructure that POWER AI agents. The engineer does not
      build, train, fine-tune, or deploy AI models themselves -
      they create the reliable infrastructure and data foundations
      (distributed systems, low-latency pipelines, observability
      stacks) that enable the AI team's agents to function.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement scalable, resilient infrastructure systems powering AI-driven
    root cause analysis and observability workflows across on-premises environments
  - Work on low-level system design foundations, ensuring efficient resource use and
    high performance at scale
  - Profile and tune backend systems to improve throughput, reduce latency, and minimize
    bottlenecks across the stack
  - Build and maintain the internal observability stack (logs, metrics, traces) used
    by AI agents to understand and act on production issues
  - Support hybrid infrastructure architectures for both cloud-hosted SaaS and on-prem
    deployments serving enterprise customers
  - Develop and maintain low-latency, high-throughput data pipelines using tools like
    Kafka, Postgres, and S3 for real-time telemetry workflows
  - Contribute to infrastructure-as-code, CI/CD tooling, and deployment systems to
    increase platform velocity and stability
  - Collaborate with AI, platform, and product teams to ensure smooth integration
    and shared reliability goals
  use_cases:
  - AI agents diagnose and remediate production incidents in real time
  - AI-driven root cause analysis for complex production issues
  - Automated troubleshooting and prevention of production incidents
  - Real-time observability workflows powered by AI agents
  - Enterprise-grade incident management and remediation
  - AI-powered software maintenance and SRE automation
