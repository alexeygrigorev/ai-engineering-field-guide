      This is a Lead SDET role focused on testing and quality
      assurance for AI products, not building or deploying AI
      models. The role involves designing test approaches for RAG,
      hallucination, drift, and bias, architecting automation
      frameworks, and defining QA strategy for AI systems - all of
      which support the AI work of others rather than directly
      working on the models themselves.

  - Define overall QA strategy and architect large-scale, reusable, cross-platform
    automation frameworks
  - Drive organisation-wide quality initiatives and own the quality charter for the
    AI vertical
  - Design scalable test approaches for RAG, hallucination, drift, and bias in AI
    models
  - Own decisions on test strategy, tools, frameworks, and AI testing methodologies
  - Coach and up-skill the entire team, set best practices, and build talent pipeline
  - Influence cross-functional teams and participate in architecture discussions
  - Responsible for end-to-end quality strategy at the product/vertical level
  - Shape AI quality roadmap and improve scalability and reliability
  use_cases:
  - Testing and validation of RAG systems for accuracy and reliability
  - Evaluating AI model outputs for hallucination detection and mitigation
  - Monitoring model drift and bias detection to ensure consistent performance
  - Quality assurance for AI-powered marketing and sales automation features
  - Testing AI workloads for performance and scalability at enterprise scale
