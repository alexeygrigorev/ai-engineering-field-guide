      This is a hands-on AI engineering role focused on building,
      training, fine-tuning, and deploying ML/DL models including
      transformers, LLMs, and computer vision systems. The
      engineer is responsible for model development,
      containerization, and deployment to production, which aligns
      with working directly ON AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Translating business requirements into requirements for AI/ML models
  - Preparing data to train and evaluate AI/ML/DL models
  - Building AI/ML/DL models by applying state-of-the-art algorithms, especially transformers
  - Testing, evaluating the AI/ML/DL models, benchmarking their quality, and publishing
    models, data sets, and evaluations
  - Deploying the models in production by containerizing the models
  - Working with customers and internal employees to refine the quality of the models
  - Establishing continuous learning pipelines for models with online learning or
    transfer learning
  - Building and deploying containerized applications on the cloud or on-premise environments
  use_cases:
  - Real-time computer vision for industrial operations in remote locations
  - Natural language processing and transformers for edge applications
  - Autonomous or robotic systems in mines, oil fields, and agricultural sites
  - Real-time analytics and AI processing at the edge where cloud connectivity is
    limited
  - Control and navigation systems for autonomous operations in remote environments
