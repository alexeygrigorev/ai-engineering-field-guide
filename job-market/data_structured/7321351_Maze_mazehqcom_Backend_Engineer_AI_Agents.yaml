position:
  title: Backend Engineer (AI Agents)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      While the role involves working with AI agents and LLMs, the
      focus is on building backend infrastructure and systems that
      support agentic workloads, not building or fine-tuning the
      models themselves. The engineer designs scalable backend
      architectures, integrates AI services into production, and
      manages the overall system - enabling AI capabilities rather
      than directly implementing the models/agents.
  responsibilities:
  - Play a pivotal role in the development and scaling of complex AI Agents for cybersecurity
    challenges
  - Design and implement backend systems that support agentic workloads, ensuring
    scalability, maintainability, and security
  - Take ownership of the entire development lifecycle from concept and design to
    deployment and maintenance
  - Work closely with cross-functional team members to ensure seamless integration
    of new features and services
  - Continuously monitor and improve application performance, security, and scalability
  - Define and enforce coding standards, best practices, and documentation to maintain
    high code quality
  - Rapidly prototype and iterate on new features based on user feedback and changing
    requirements
  - Mentor junior engineers and lead technical discussions and code reviews as the
    team grows
  use_cases:
  - Using AI Agents to tackle major cybersecurity challenges and threats
  - Deploying Generative AI (LLMs and Agents) to solve pressing cybersecurity issues
  - Helping security teams leverage AI to mitigate risks and improve outcomes
  - Building AI-powered cybersecurity solutions that integrate across the stack
  - Creating systems that deliver breakthrough capabilities for security operations
