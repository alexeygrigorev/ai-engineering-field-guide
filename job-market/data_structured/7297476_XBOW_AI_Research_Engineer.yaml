    AI-powered offensive security platform for automated
    vulnerability discovery and exploitation
position:
  title: AI Research Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work with LLMs including
      prompting strategies, agentic orchestration, and building
      systems that coordinate language models with real-world
      security tasks. The engineer will design prompt flows,
      implement orchestration layers, and directly advance the
      intelligence of the AI platform.
  responsibilities:
  - Build LLM-powered software with prompt flows and orchestrations that ensure great
    performance with no false positives
  - Architect and build production-grade, testable, and maintainable AI-powered software
    stack
  - Design and build experiments and evaluation frameworks for performance testing
    at scale, conducting data analysis
  - Collaborate with AI team, security experts, and developers to create end-to-end
    systems
  - Own projects end-to-end from ideation and experimentation to deployment and production
    monitoring
  - Conduct continuous research on harnessing LLM advancements to improve system performance
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous discovery and validation of software vulnerabilities
  - AI-powered exploitation of identified vulnerabilities
  - Proof-backed security results delivered in hours instead of weeks
  - Real-world zero-day vulnerability detection across software systems
  - Security testing at scale using LLM orchestration
