      This role involves hands-on building and deploying AI
      systems: designing the AI layer, productionizing LLMs,
      developing RAG-backed workflows, building agents and
      orchestration frameworks, and implementing fine-tuning and
      evaluation systems. This is direct work ON AI models and
      systems, not support infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build the AI layer that powers autonomous detection, RAG-backed investigation,
    and auto-remediation workflows
  - Develop and productionize large-scale LLMs, graph-based reasoning engines, and
    streaming feature pipelines operating on billions of security events
  - Own evaluation and reliability including prompt libraries, fine-tuning, red-team
    testing, latency budgets, and fallback strategies
  - Mentor and grow AI engineers, run design reviews, uphold code quality, and instill
    security-first mindset
  - Partner with Product, Detection Engineering, and Customer Success to translate
    attacker behavior into robust ML and rule-based detections
  - Experiment with retrieval-augmented generation, tool-calling agents, and multi-modal
    models combining text, logs, and graphs
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous threat detection using AI-powered systems that analyze security events
  - RAG-backed investigation workflows for cybersecurity incident analysis
  - Automated remediation of security threats through AI-driven decision making
  - Real-time processing and analysis of billions of security events using streaming
    pipelines
  - Multi-modal threat detection combining text analysis, log data, and graph-based
    reasoning
  - Graph-based reasoning engines for understanding attacker behavior patterns
