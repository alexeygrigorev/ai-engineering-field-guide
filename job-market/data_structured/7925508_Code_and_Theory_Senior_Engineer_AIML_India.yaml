      This role requires hands-on work building and deploying
      generative AI models, specifically multimodal systems (text-
      to-image, image-to-text). The candidate will work directly
      with diffusion models, transformer architectures, fine-
      tuning (LoRA), and deploying models to production, which
      clearly falls under working ON AI/ML systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and deploy multimodal generative AI models including text-to-image and image-to-text
    applications
  - Work with cross-modal architectures and multimodal fusion techniques across text,
    vision, audio, and video
  - Develop solutions using diffusion models, transformer-based generative models,
    and GANs
  - Optimize and serve ML models in production with monitoring capabilities
  - Mentor team members and advocate for adoption of emerging AI technologies
  - Collaborate on novel multimodal applications across diverse client industries
  use_cases:
  - Text-to-image generation for creative and marketing applications
  - Image-to-text processing for content understanding and analysis
  - Cross-modal content generation across text, vision, audio, and video formats
  - Enterprise solutions leveraging generative AI for diverse industries including
    tech, financial services, media, and government
  - Creative applications for Fortune 100 clients and startups across multiple business
