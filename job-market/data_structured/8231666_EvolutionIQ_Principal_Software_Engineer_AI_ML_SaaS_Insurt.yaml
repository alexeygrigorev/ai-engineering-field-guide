    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a Principal Software Engineer role focused on
      building platform infrastructure (data pipelines, API
      platforms, user-facing applications) that supports AI/ML
      systems rather than directly building, training, or fine-
      tuning models. While the role integrates LLMs and processes
      unstructured data for the platform, the work is
      architectural and systems-focused on enabling data science
      and ML teams rather than hands-on model development.
  responsibilities:
  - 'Architect and deliver version 2 of AI claims management platform with three foundational
    systems: Data Ingestion/Pipeline, API Platform, and User facing application'
  - Design and implement scalable systems that handle tens of millions of documents
    daily including unstructured data streams like OCR and phone call transcriptions
  - Provide strategic technical guidance across the engineering organization and transform
    the 100+ person engineering team
  - Mentor junior engineers and foster a culture of technical excellence and innovation
  - Collaborate with leadership including CTO and VPs to align technical strategy
    and deliver impactful solutions
  - Enable rapid product deployment through modular, configuration-based designs that
    allow two-week product launch cycles
  use_cases:
  - Process tens of millions of medical documents and unstructured data streams including
    OCR and phone call transcriptions
  - Transform raw insurance claims data into actionable insights using EvolutionGPT
    platform and LLMs
  - Enable insurance claims teams to make claims handling more accurate, fair, and
    efficient
  - Support Disability and Workers Compensation insurance lines with data science-driven
    claims guidance
  - Analyze large unstructured datasets that have never been used for data science
    in the insurance industry
