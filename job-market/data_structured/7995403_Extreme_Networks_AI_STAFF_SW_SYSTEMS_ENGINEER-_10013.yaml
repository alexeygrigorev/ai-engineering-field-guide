      The role requires hands-on experience delivering Generative
      AI solutions including RAG, AI Agents, and LLM fine-tuning
      in production. Responsibilities include building real-time
      inferencing solutions for AI Agents and designing ML
      services, indicating direct work on AI/ML systems rather
      than just support infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, implement, and maintain scalable distributed systems, data pipelines,
    and ML services
  - Contribute to system architecture discussions and shape design decisions for production
    systems
  - Build and optimize microservices and real-time inferencing solutions powering
    AI Agents
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate Big Data and Generative AI
    solutions into products and platforms
  - Write high-quality, production-ready code and participate in design reviews, code
    reviews, and testing
  - Mentor junior engineers and contribute to engineering best practices
  use_cases:
  - AI-driven network management and network intelligence
  - Multi-agent systems that perceive, learn, and act in real time for network operations
  - Knowledge bases and RAG for network documentation and support
  - Data mining and anomaly detection for network performance monitoring
  - LLM-powered assistants for network configuration and troubleshooting
