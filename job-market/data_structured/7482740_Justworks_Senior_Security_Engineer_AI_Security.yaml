      This is a security engineering role focused on protecting AI
      systems, not building them. The candidate will evaluate AI
      threats, design security controls, implement guardrails, and
      secure AI infrastructure rather than develop, train, or
      deploy AI models directly. While they work with AI

  - Research AI trends, threat landscape, vulnerabilities and remediations, and AI
    security control advancement
  - Evaluate and assess AI tools and play a critical role in AI system management
    and governance
  - Develop AI security architecture and design standards across applications and
    infrastructure
  - Implement AI security capabilities in AWS for corporate and production environments
  - Provide technical and architectural guidance on AI security to product managers,
    engineers, and IT
  - Assist teams to implement AI models for security controls, operations, and risk
    management
  - Collaborate with engineering and risk teams to build AI security control requirements
  - Help Cyber Defense Operations triage incidents related to AI security in internal
    networks and production
