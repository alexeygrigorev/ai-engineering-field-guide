    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role requires hands-on building and deployment of
      production AI systems that combine LLMs, machine learning,
      and structured data. The engineer directly works with LLMs,
      RAG, tool use, and agentic AI systems—not just supporting
      infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and operate production-grade AI systems that combine machine learning, large
    language models, and structured data
  - Apply machine learning and AI techniques to graph-structured and networked data,
    enabling reasoning over entities, relationships, and complex information structures
  - Design AI systems with strong guarantees around correctness, transparency, and
    performance
  - Partner with data and backend engineers to bring AI capabilities into scalable
    platform services
  - Own AI components end-to-end, from initial design through deployment and long-term
    maintenance
  - Provide technical leadership through design reviews, mentorship, and shared best
    practices
  use_cases:
  - Detect and understand emergent threats through narrative and risk intelligence
  - Surface, contextualize, and explain complex information ecosystems for high-stakes
    decision making
  - Enable reasoning over entities and relationships in graph-structured data
  - Provide explainable and auditable AI systems customers can trust
  - Apply ML and LLM techniques to network-based problems like relationship discovery
    and influence propagation
