      This role involves building, deploying, and fine-tuning ML
      models including multimodal AI systems. The engineer
      directly works on model implementation, inference systems,
      and transitioning research models into production, which
      aligns with hands-on AI/ML system building rather than just
      support infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and deploy production ML models for content and product ecosystem
  - Design scalable ML infrastructure and pipelines handling massive media datasets
  - Implement inference systems for content optimization across multiple verticals
  - Fine-tune and deploy multimodal AI systems using MLOps best practices
  - Collaborate with data science teams to transition research models into production
  - Optimize model performance for cost efficiency while maintaining accuracy and
    speed
  - Integrate ML capabilities into existing platforms and build APIs for model consumption
  use_cases:
  - Content optimization across multiple media verticals
  - Real-time understanding and tracking of cultural trends
  - Enhancing creative processes through AI capabilities
  - Scaling ML systems to millions of users with low latency
  - Processing and analyzing massive media datasets
