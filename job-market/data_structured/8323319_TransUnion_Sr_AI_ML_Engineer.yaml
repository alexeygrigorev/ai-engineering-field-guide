    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work building LLM applications,
      RAG pipelines, and AI systems including fine-tuning,
      deployment, and optimization of models. The engineer will
      directly work with GenAI frameworks (LangChain, LangGraph,
      LangChain4j), vector databases, and implement agentic AI
      workflows - all core AI engineering tasks rather than just
      supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the design and delivery of enterprise-scale AI/GenAI solutions including
    LLM apps and RAG pipelines
  - Architect end-to-end AI platforms integrating LLMs, RAG, streaming, vector search,
    and CI/CD using Python and Java microservices
  - Lead LLM fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment with optimized retrieval pipelines
    using various vector stores
  - Build LangChain4j pipelines for prompts, tools, and agents interoperable with
    Python-hosted model endpoints
  - Guide deployments on cloud platforms using Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, and managed
    ML services
  - Define architecture standards, patterns, and best practices while mentoring engineers
    and architects
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise-scale LLM applications and conversational AI systems
  - RAG-based knowledge retrieval and semantic search solutions
  - Real-time AI processing with streaming and event-driven architectures
  - Agentic AI workflows with tools and function calling
  - Cloud-native ML services and model deployment platforms
