      This is a hands-on AI engineering role focused on building
      LLM-powered systems including RAG pipelines, chat agents,
      and vector search architectures. The role requires direct
      implementation of LLM integration, prompt orchestration, and
      agentic systems using frameworks like LangChain and
      LlamaIndex, which qualifies as working directly ON AI
      systems rather than supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, implement, and optimize LLM-powered systems including RAG, chat agents,
    summarizers, and knowledge graph integration
  - Build and manage data indexing and retrieval pipelines using LlamaIndex, LangChain,
    or similar frameworks
  - Implement and maintain vector databases such as Pinecone, Neo4j, Weaviate, Chroma,
    or Azure Cognitive Search
  - Integrate open-source and proprietary LLMs including GPT, Claude, and Llama into
    the CoreStory Platform
  - Develop and refine AI-driven features including generative insights, automated
    summarization, and narrative analytics
  - Collaborate with DevOps and backend teams to deploy scalable AI services within
    cloud infrastructure
  - Continuously benchmark model performance, latency, and cost while identifying
    optimization opportunities
  - Contribute to internal documentation, experimentation frameworks, and evaluation
    methodologies
  use_cases:
  - Surfacing business logic and technical insights from legacy code using AI
  - Generating automated summaries and narrative analytics for enterprise applications
  - Enabling enterprises to modernize applications faster by understanding code structure
    and dependencies
  - Providing conversational agents to query and analyze codebases and documentation
  - Extracting and indexing knowledge from legacy systems for intelligent search and
    retrieval
  - Reducing risk of costly failures by identifying potential issues in legacy code
