    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is a hands-on AI engineering role building and
      deploying production AI systems including RAG pipelines, LLM
      workflows, document understanding, and agentic systems. The
      engineer will own the entire AI stack from unstructured
      document ingestion to interactive LLM outputs, directly
      implementing models and workflows rather than just
      supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and ship production AI features end-to-end from R&D to SaaS integration,
    observability, and iteration
  - Design and deploy advanced document understanding systems including RAG pipelines,
    clause segmentation, summarization, and risk detection
  - Create scalable APIs that deliver real-time coverage analysis, comparisons, and
    recommendations inside a modern SaaS UI
  - Engineer robust data workflows across OCR, PDF ingestion, parsing, normalization,
    and embedding generation
  - Own evaluation and observability from automated accuracy pipelines to human-in-the-loop
    systems that maintain trust and reliability
  - Design for explainability and develop transparent workflows that help legal, claims,
    and compliance professionals understand what the AI sees and says
  - Collaborate across disciplines with designers, PMs, and domain experts to translate
    insurance workflows into AI-powered systems
  - Set technical direction and shape infrastructure, tooling, and AI product roadmap
    from the ground up
  use_cases:
  - Insurance policy interpretation and analysis for P&C insurance professionals
  - Reading and understanding complex legal documents like insurance policies with
    lawyer-level accuracy
  - Coverage analysis, comparisons, and recommendations for claims advocates, brokers,
    and underwriters
  - Risk detection and clause-level segmentation in insurance contracts
  - Legal-grade decision support for claims, underwriting, and compliance teams
  - Interactive AI-powered workflows that reduce reliance on siloed expertise in the
    insurance industry
