      This is an Analytics Engineer role that primarily focuses on
      building data models, dashboards, and analytics
      infrastructure. While it mentions leveraging AI/ML
      techniques and LLM-based tools for insights and predictions,
      the core work involves analytics engineering, data modeling,
      and building foundations that support AI applications rather
      than directly building, training, or deploying AI models.
      The role is more about enabling AI-driven insights and
      predictive modeling within an analytics context.
  responsibilities:
  - Partner with Sales, Marketing, Operations, and CSM leaders to define and operationalize
    Growth & Retention KPIs including acquisition, activation, expansion, churn, LTV,
    and NRR
  - Build and maintain a B2B Customer 360 data model integrating product usage, contracts,
    billing, support, engagement, and operational signals
  - Design, build, and maintain analytics data models and semantic layers that power
    dashboards and AI-driven insights
  - Develop churn prediction models, customer health scores, and expansion propensity
    models to identify leading indicators for business outcomes
  - Leverage AI/ML and LLM-based techniques for automated insight generation, anomaly
    detection, opportunity and risk scoring, and natural language analytics
  - Ensure high data quality, reliability, and observability while driving best practices
    in analytics engineering including testing, version control, and documentation
  use_cases:
  - B2B Customer 360 analytics creating unified customer views across product usage,
    commercial, operational, and engagement data
  - Growth and retention analytics with predictive models for churn risk, customer
    health scoring, and expansion propensity
