      This is a fullstack software engineering role focused on
      building AI-native interfaces and integrating AI
      capabilities into Coinbase products. The role involves
      implementing AI-driven workflows and guardrails, but is
      primarily about building the application layer around AI
      technologies rather than directly developing, training, or
      deploying models. Applied AI experience (Foundational
      Models, Agents, RAG) is listed as a nice-to-have, not a core
      requirement.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build core services and interfaces that turn natural-language goals
    into safe, compliant Coinbase product workflows
  - Implement risk and compliance guardrails directly into execution paths
  - Work closely with many different product teams at Coinbase to externalize their
    features through AI-native experiences, ensuring consistency of concepts, style,
    and design
  - Troubleshoot and debug complex fullstack issues, ensuring stability, reliability,
    and security
  - Participate in code reviews and provide constructive feedback to maintain high
    code quality standards
  use_cases:
  - Natural language to workflow conversion for crypto product interactions
  - AI-native experiences for Coinbase financial products
  - Compliance and risk guardrails for AI-driven financial transactions
  - Consumer-facing AI assistant for cryptocurrency services
