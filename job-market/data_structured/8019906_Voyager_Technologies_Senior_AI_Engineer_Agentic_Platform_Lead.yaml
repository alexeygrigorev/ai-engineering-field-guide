position:
  title: Senior AI Engineer – Agentic Platform Lead
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves directly building and architecting multi-
      agent AI systems, implementing LLM-based agents, and
      creating agent orchestration frameworks. The engineer is
      hands-on with agentic AI platforms, RAG systems, and
      autonomous agent execution environments for hardware design
      automation.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and own the full stack ACE platform for the Generative Engine, including
    agent orchestration, execution runtimes, and frontend and backend services
  - Design and implement distributed systems patterns such as orchestrator-worker
    and swarms that coordinate AI agents across the full hardware design lifecycle
  - Build the secure execution layer where agents can autonomously run code, simulations,
    and analyses against internal tools and data sources
  - Design and implement memory, context, and provenance systems including RAG, vector
    stores, and decision logs so agents can recall and justify prior design decisions
  - Aggressively profile and optimize system performance with a focus on latency,
    reliability, and observability for large numbers of concurrent agents
  - Lead and mentor a small team of exceptional engineers, scientists, and/or mathematicians
    setting standards, reviewing code, and growing early-career talent
  - Collaborate with domain teams in electronics, propulsion, and manufacturing to
    translate their workflows into scalable agentic capabilities on the platform
  - Influence long-range technical strategy for ACE and help define how agentic AI
    is used across Voyager's engineering stack
  use_cases:
  - AI agents design complex hardware systems end-to-end through autonomous reasoning
    and decision-making
  - Compress complex hardware development cycles from years to days using agentic
    AI systems
  - Integrate Design for Manufacturing (DfM), Design for Assembly (DfA), and Design
    for Test (DfT) into initial design specifications
  - Connect AI agents to engineering tools such as Ansys, Altium, and CAD/CAE platforms
    for automated analysis
  - Enable agents to autonomously run physics simulations, test data analysis, and
    manufacturing workflow optimization
