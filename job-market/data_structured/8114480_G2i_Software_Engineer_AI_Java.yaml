  title: Software Engineer, AI (Java)

    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      The role focuses on RLHF data collection - ranking, editing,
      and providing feedback on AI-generated code rather than
      building or deploying models. The candidate performs human-
      in-the-loop evaluation to generate training signals for
      model improvement, which is supporting work for the AI
      training pipeline. No ML or AI experience is required, and
      the work is centered around code review and feedback
      injection.
  responsibilities:
  - Compare and rank multiple code snippets with detailed explanations of which is
    best and why
  - Repair and refactor AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and style
  - Inject feedback including ratings, edits, and test results into the RLHF pipeline
  - Identify logic errors, performance traps, and security issues through code review
  use_cases:
  - Training large language models to write production-grade code across multiple
    programming languages
  - Conducting RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) for code generation
    models
  - Converting expert code reviews and feedback into reward signals for model fine-tuning
