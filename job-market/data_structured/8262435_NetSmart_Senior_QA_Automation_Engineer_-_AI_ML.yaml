    reasoning: |-
      This is a QA Automation Engineer role focused on validating
      and testing applications integrated with AI/ML/GenAI
      workflows. The role does not involve building, training, or
      deploying models, but rather testing, validating outputs,
      and ensuring quality of AI-driven features built by other
      teams.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and maintain modular, extensible, and reusable test automation
    frameworks and scripts
  - Develop and execute automated test scripts to validate stability and responsiveness
    of applications
  - Perform validation and create test data for applications, APIs, and Agents integrated
    with AI/ML/GenAI workflows
  - Implement Risk Gating processes to validate AI model outputs for accuracy, bias,
    toxicity, correctness, and traceability
  - Develop automation frameworks for continuous validation of applications and AI-driven
    features
  - Design checks for accuracy, hallucinations, bias, correctness, and traceability
    of model outputs
  - Identify, report, and track product defects with clear documentation
  - Participate in product design reviews to provide input on automation feasibility
    and testing implications
  use_cases:
  - Validation of AI/ML/GenAI integrated applications and workflows
  - Risk gating for AI model outputs including accuracy, bias, and toxicity detection
  - Testing of agent-based applications integrated with AI systems
  - Model evaluation using metrics such as precision/recall, BLEU/ROUGE, and bias
    scores
  - Continuous validation and regression testing for AI-driven features
  - Test data generation and validation for ML pipelines and data drift detection
