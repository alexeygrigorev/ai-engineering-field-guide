      This role uses generative AI tools (Adobe Firefly,
      Midjourney) as part of the design workflow to augment
      creative output, but the primary function is graphic design
      and visual storytelling rather than building, training, or
      deploying AI systems. The role is AI-support because it uses
      AI tools as a creative assistant within a traditional design
      role, not as an ML engineer or AI developer.

  - Design digital assets including eBooks, ads, social media visuals, interactive
    web assets, and landing pages
  - Use generative AI tools to augment, experiment, and scale creative output while
    maintaining brand integrity
  - Translate strategy and messaging into performance-driven creative across digital
    and print channels
  - Collaborate with writers, video producers, and campaign strategists to bring stories
    to life visually
  - Work with creative tech stack including Adobe CC, Adobe Firefly, Figma, Bynder,
    Seismic, Google Drive, and Monday.com
  - Bring ideas to planning sessions, test new formats, and track creative design
    performance
  - Define and evolve visual standards across Product, Brand, and Demand Gen teams
