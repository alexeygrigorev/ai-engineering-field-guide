    reasoning: |-
      This is a Principal Software Engineer role focused on
      integrating AI into engineering workflows and developer
      productivity rather than building AI/ML models themselves.
      The role emphasizes using AI-assisted development tools,
      prompting practices, and establishing patterns for AI usage
      across teams - all in service of improving delivery speed
      and developer effectiveness, not model development or
      deployment.
  responsibilities:
  - Drive architectural coherence and technical direction across multiple customer-facing
    systems and teams
  - Design and evolve high-leverage APIs, data models, and distributed systems that
    power learner journeys, personalization, and experimentation
  - Establish shared patterns, abstractions, and standards that reduce fragmentation
    and increase engineering leverage
  - Act as a role model for AI-native workflows across design, coding, testing, code
    review, debugging, and incident response
  - Identify and implement opportunities where AI can measurably improve developer
    productivity, delivery speed, and production quality
  - Multiply impact through mentoring senior engineers, influencing without authority,
    and hands-on contributions when critical paths require it
  use_cases:
  - Language learning platform with millions of learners worldwide
  - Learner journey personalization and experimentation
  - AI-assisted development workflows to improve engineering productivity
  - Prompt engineering and AI-native development practices
  - Customer-facing learning experience systems
  - Developer tooling and AI integration for software development lifecycle
