    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This Principal Engineer role involves hands-on design and
      implementation of AI systems including model selection,
      LLM/ML integration, inference pipelines, and orchestration.
      The role requires building, deploying, and optimizing
      intelligent systems end-to-end, not just supporting
      infrastructure or platforms for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Own architecture for AI and intelligence systems across model integration, inference
    pipelines, evaluation frameworks, and product interfaces
  - Lead solution design for high-complexity, AI-driven initiatives and deliver production-ready
    implementations when needed
  - Design and implement AI-powered features end-to-end, including model selection,
    orchestration, inference pipelines, confidence handling, and integration with
    product workflows
  - Define patterns and standards for safe, observable, and explainable AI usage across
    teams
  - Guide decisions on model selection, orchestration, cost-performance tradeoffs,
    and system scalability
  - Diagnose and resolve issues across data inputs, model behavior, system integration,
    and user-facing outcomes
  - Mentor senior engineers and elevate engineering culture around intelligent system
    design
  - Partner closely with product, data, CTO, and platform teams to shape roadmap feasibility
    and long-term intelligence strategy
  use_cases:
  - Translate product ideas, domain concepts, and company vision into intelligent
    systems that reason over food, ingredients, nutrition, and user preferences
  - Combine LLMs, traditional ML, rules, and deterministic logic into coherent, testable
    workflows for food and nutrition intelligence
  - Apply AI techniques to improve personalization, understanding, and automation
    in nutrition recommendations
  - Deliver responsible, transparent, and explainable AI that aligns with consumer
    trust and empowerment
  - Build hybrid intelligence systems that balance probabilistic reasoning with deterministic
    computation for accurate nutrition guidance
  - Enable personalized nutrition recommendations based on comprehensive food and
    nutrition data analysis
