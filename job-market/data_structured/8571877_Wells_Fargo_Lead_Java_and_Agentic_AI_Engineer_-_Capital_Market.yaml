    reasoning: |-
      The role is primarily a Java software engineering position
      focused on building distributed systems for capital markets.
      While the title mentions "Agentic AI," the actual
      responsibilities leverage GenAI tools to produce code and
      propose AI solutions for technology processes, rather than
      building, training, or deploying AI models or agents
      directly. The core work involves Java development,
      microservices architecture, and database design, with AI
      used as a productivity tool rather than the primary
      deliverable.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop software for EF&F components as an individual contributor
  - Translate business specifications into functional specifications and architectures
  - Analyze and refactor legacy code into scalable microservice architecture
  - Write high-quality Java code using object-oriented principles and design patterns
  - Create and modify RDBMS objects including tables, views, and stored procedures
  - Build applications requiring minimal or no L2 support
  - Leverage GenAI tools to produce high-quality code and maintain productivity
  - Identify technology process improvements and propose AI technology solutions
  use_cases:
  - Clearing and market making functions in capital markets
  - Equity swaps and equity derivatives trading applications
  - Risk and margin management for financial instruments
  - Trade lifecycle processing including confirmation, clearing and settlement
  - Low-latency, high-throughput trading platforms
  - Risk applications and regulatory compliance systems
