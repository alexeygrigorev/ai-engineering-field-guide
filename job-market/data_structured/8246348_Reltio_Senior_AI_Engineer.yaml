      The role requires hands-on development of agentic AI
      systems, integrating LLMs, building agent architectures
      using frameworks like LangGraph, Crew AI, and AutoGen, and
      implementing prompt engineering and tool invocation. This is
      direct work building AI systems rather than supporting
      infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop robust, scalable Java/Python based backend systems that enable the orchestration
    of Agentic AI workflows
  - Develop state-of-the-art AI/ML models for solving real-world data management challenges
    such as entity resolution, classification, similarity matching, and anomaly detection
  - Integrate LLMs into backend pipelines to power autonomous or semi-autonomous decision-making
  - Design agent architectures and LLM toolchains using frameworks like LangGraph,
    Crew AI, AutoGen, and similar
  - Implement services and APIs that manage prompt chaining, tool invocation, and
    contextual memory for agents
  - Apply prompt engineering best practices to improve agent behavior, task accuracy,
    and adaptability
  - Monitor and optimize service performance, reliability, and scalability in production
    environments
  - Continuously monitor and improve model performance using feedback loops, A/B testing,
    drift detection, and retraining strategies
  use_cases:
  - Entity resolution and data unification across siloed sources
  - Enterprise master data management and multi-domain MDM
  - Autonomous or semi-autonomous decision-making powered by LLMs
  - Classification, similarity matching, and anomaly detection for data management
  - Agentic AI workflows with tool invocation and contextual memory
  - LLM-powered agents, copilots, or task bots for data-rich environments
