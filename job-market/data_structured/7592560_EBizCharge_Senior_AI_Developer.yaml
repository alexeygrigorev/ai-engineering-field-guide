      The role involves hands-on work building MCP servers that
      expose tools to AI assistants and agents, implementing
      function calling, integrating with Azure AI Foundry agents,
      and designing agentic AI systems. This is directly building
      AI infrastructure and tooling for AI agents rather than
      supporting AI work done by others.

    automated workflows
  - Ensure security and access control for MCP servers, limiting agent access to authorized
    tools and data
  - Collaborate with product managers and front-end teams to integrate AI capabilities
    into user-facing platforms like Microsoft Copilot and web portals
  - Utilize Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and Cognitive Services to connect AI workflows
    with enterprise systems including Azure Storage, SQL, and Compute Services
  use_cases:
  - AI assistants and agents accessing external capabilities through MCP servers
  - Automated data querying from databases and external APIs via AI agents
  - Workflow automation and business process orchestration powered by AI
