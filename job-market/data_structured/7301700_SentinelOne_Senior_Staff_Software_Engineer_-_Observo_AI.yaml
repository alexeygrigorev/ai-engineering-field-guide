    reasoning: |-
      This is an infrastructure and ML infrastructure role focused
      on building data pipelines and platforms that use ML for
      optimization, not on building, training, or deploying ML
      models directly. The engineer architects data processing
      systems, ML-driven routing engines, and real-time analytics
      platforms that support AI/ML work, but works with Data
      Science teams rather than implementing models themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the architectural design and technical roadmap for scalable, high-performance
    data processing pipelines capable of handling petabyte-scale telemetry data
  - Drive the development and optimization of ML-driven data routing, filtering, and
    transformation engines to reduce customer data volumes by 80%+
  - Architect and implement real-time analytics and anomaly detection systems using
    advanced machine learning techniques and large language models
  - Design cloud-native microservices and APIs that integrate seamlessly with major
    observability platforms
  - Establish robust monitoring, alerting, and observability solutions for distributed
    systems operating at enterprise scale
  - Lead cross-functional technical initiatives, collaborating with Product, Data
    Science, and DevOps teams to translate strategic vision into technical solutions
  use_cases:
  - Process and optimize petabyte-scale telemetry data including logs, metrics, and
    traces for enterprise customers
  - Reduce customer data volumes by 80%+ while preserving critical insights through
    ML-driven data routing and filtering
  - Enable real-time anomaly detection and analytics on observability data using machine
    learning and large language models
  - Integrate seamlessly with major observability platforms like Splunk, Elastic,
    Datadog, and New Relic
  - Improve cost efficiency and operational insights for enterprise data infrastructure
