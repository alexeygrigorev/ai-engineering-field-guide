      This is an AI Engineer role with hands-on responsibility for
      building, deploying, and operating agentic AI frameworks,
      RAG pipelines, and intelligent agents. The role directly
      works with LLM integration, agent orchestration, and
      productionizing AI systems, not just supporting
      infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build and maintain agentic AI framework that interact with Ohme's data
    platform, APIs, and internal tools
  - Implement and operate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines using structured
    and unstructured data sources
  - Build and integrate agent memory, orchestration, and tool-use patterns for real-world
    workflows
  - Develop and deploy AI services using Python or other languages using software
    engineering best practices
  - Define and manage cloud infrastructure using AWS CDK (Python) and infrastructure-as-code
    best practices
  - Collaborate closely with data scientists, data engineers, applied AI analysts
    and product teams to deliver end-to-end solutions
  use_cases:
  - Agentic AI framework for smart-grid platform integration
  - RAG pipelines for structured and unstructured energy/charging data retrieval
  - Intelligent agents that interact with APIs, data services, and users
  - Tool-using agents for real-world EV charging and energy workflows
  - Agent memory and state management for multi-step energy optimization tasks
  - AI services for connecting cars, chargers, energy providers, and consumers
