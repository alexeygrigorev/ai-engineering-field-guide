  - Stay at the forefront of the AI development ecosystem, evaluating emerging tools
    and making informed technology adoption decisions
  - Drive proficiency with AI coding tools and practices across the engineering organization
  - Build platforms that enable developers to offload work to AI and improve AI performance
    on Ramp-specific development tasks
  - Gather developer feedback, identify friction points, and iterate on solutions
    that improve developer velocity
  - Grow AI vendor partnerships and serve as the advocate for Ramp's engineers
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered developer tooling and infrastructure to accelerate engineering productivity
  - Platform for agent-driven engineering enabling engineers to build software faster
  - AI coding tools and automation to offload development work and improve velocity
  - Internal developer platforms integrating AI capabilities into Ramp's engineering
