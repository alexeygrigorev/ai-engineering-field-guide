      deploying LLM-powered systems including prompt engineering,
      agent logic, RAG pipelines, and model evaluation. The

  - Help improve Distillery, Distyl's internal LLM application platform, by building
    reusable components, tools, and workflows
  - Write clean, well-tested, and observable code that meets reliability, performance,
    and security standards
  - Evaluate AI systems across accuracy, latency, cost, and robustness using metrics
    and user feedback

  - Power core operational workflows for Fortune 500 companies across insurance, CPG,
    and non-profits
  - Deliver working AI systems with rapid time to value within a quarter
  - Help companies identify, build, and realize value from their GenAI investments
