      This is a Product Marketing Manager role focused on go-to-
      market strategy, positioning, and marketing content for
      Amplitude's AI analytics platform. While the role requires
      technical fluency with AI product development workflows and
      LLM analytics, it does not involve building, training, fine-
      tuning, or deploying AI models directly. The role exists to
      market and position AI/analytics products that other teams
      build.
  responsibilities:
  - Shape the narrative for product development in the AI era by articulating why
    analytics becomes critical as AI accelerates building speed
  - Develop messaging that resonates with Product Managers while demonstrating technical
    depth to earn credibility with Engineering partners
  - Drive adoption by leading launches for experimentation, feature management, and
    LLM analytics capabilities focused on PM workflows
  - Build enablement programs for sales and customer success teams on experimentation
    culture and AI-readiness
  - Create compelling product stories and case studies with customer evidence showcasing
    how experimentation enables product velocity
  - Position Amplitude's unique value for product teams by differentiating from developer-first
    tools
  - Partner with product teams to shape roadmap based on how modern product teams
    want to work with AI tools
  use_cases:
  - AI model performance testing and measurement for product teams
  - Feature experimentation and A/B testing for AI-powered products
  - LLM analytics to track and evaluate large language model outputs in production
  - Feature flags and gradual rollouts for AI features to test models on small cohorts
  - Data-driven product development enabling PMs to validate hypotheses without engineering
    dependencies
  - Real-time user behavior and business outcome measurement for AI product optimization
