      The role involves building and deploying AI/ML models into
      production workflows, with direct responsibility for
      implementing reliable AI systems, optimizing performance
      against business goals, and managing models from development
      to deployment. The job explicitly mentions working with AI
      techniques including embeddings and LLMs, which requires
      hands-on work with models and algorithms.
  responsibilities:
  - Build, maintain, and improve Python services and pipelines for AI workloads
  - Deploy AI models and algorithms using containerization with Docker and cloud infrastructure
    (AWS)
  - Own projects from implementation to deployment, ensuring stability and performance
  - Run experiments, evaluate results, and interpret performance metrics
  - Follow solid engineering principles to produce clean, well-tested, and production-ready
    code
  - Optimize and measure the performance of models and algorithms against business
    goals
  use_cases:
  - NLP-enabled machine learning for language services
  - Training data transformation for ML models
  - Multilingual content translation and localization
  - Model evaluation using embeddings and LLMs as judges
  - Content annotation and evaluation workflows
