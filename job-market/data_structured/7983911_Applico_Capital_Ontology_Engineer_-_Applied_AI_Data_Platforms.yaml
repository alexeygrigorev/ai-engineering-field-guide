  title: Ontology Engineer - Applied AI & Data Platforms

    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is an Ontology Engineer role focused on designing
      semantic models, knowledge graphs, and data schemas that
      enable AI systems to function. The work involves building
      the infrastructure and data architecture that supports AI
      teams (contextual retrieval, RAG, entity linking) rather
      than directly building, training, or deploying models
      themselves. The role sits at the intersection of data
      architecture and applied AI, providing the foundational
      structure that makes data "ready for automation and AI."
  responsibilities:
  - Design and maintain domain ontologies and semantic schemas for key business entities
  - Map internal data structures to open data standards and taxonomies
  - Build and manage knowledge graph models and associated metadata structures
  - Define and enforce data modeling conventions, relationships, and validation rules
    using RDF, OWL, SHACL, and JSON-LD
  - Partner with data engineers and architects to embed semantic models into pipelines
    and APIs
  - Collaborate with AI teams to support contextual retrieval, entity linking, and
    enrichment using LLMs and embeddings
  - Evaluate and adopt open-source tools for ontology management, graph storage, and
    reasoning
  - Contribute to data governance, lineage, and interoperability practices across
    business domains
  use_cases:
  - B2B distribution industry transformation using AI and modern technologies
  - Enterprise data interoperability across multiple distributors and business systems
  - Unlocking AI-enabled synergies in the $8 trillion B2B distribution market
  - Data automation and AI readiness for products, suppliers, customers, and transactions
  - Contextual retrieval and entity linking for AI-powered enrichment
