      This role involves building LLM-based agents directly,
      including prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and implementing
      tools and mechanisms for agentic systems. The engineer will
      own data science models from identity ML solutions to
      agentic AI solutions, with hands-on production deployment of
      agents.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead end-to-end development of advanced LLM-based agents including prompt engineering,
    fine-tuning, and building specialized tools/functions for agents
  - Establish and implement rigorous evaluation methodologies including LLM-as-a-judge
    and adversarial testing to measure agent performance, reliability, and safety
  - Define long-term data science strategy for agentic AI systems across products
    including model selection and data pipelines for multi-step autonomous behavior
  - Act as thought leader and mentor to teams of Data Scientists, ML Engineers, and
    Software Engineers driving best practices in data infrastructure and MLOps
  - Partner closely with Product Management, Engineering, and Data Science teams to
    translate agent-based product requirements into actionable solutions
  - Own and implement data science models in use within products from Identity machine
    learning solutions to agentic AI solutions
  use_cases:
  - LLM-based agent systems with sophisticated planning and memory mechanisms for
    autonomous and human-in-the-loop workflows
  - Identity machine learning solutions for customer data resolution and matching
  - Agentic AI solutions integrated across LiveRamp's data collaboration platform
    products
  - Multi-step autonomous agent workflows with tools/function calling capabilities
  - Evaluation and safety systems for measuring agent performance, bias, and drift
    in production
