      This role involves building, deploying, and scaling
      Generative AI systems including RAG pipelines, agent
      orchestration, LLM fine-tuning, and vector search
      infrastructure. The engineer is directly implementing model
      capabilities (agents, RAG, prompt orchestration, guardrails)
      rather than just supporting AI workflows for other teams.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement foundational GenAI services including vector search, prompt
    tuning, agent orchestration, document extraction, context/memory services, model/endpoint
    registry, feature/embedding stores, guardrails, and evaluation pipelines
  - Build infrastructure for autonomous and semi-autonomous AI agents with support
    for agent collaboration, reasoning, memory persistence, and continuous context-aware
    execution
  - Build standardized APIs/SDKs for composing, deploying, and monitoring Generative
    AI workloads across enterprise systems
  - Implement RAG at scale with ingestion pipelines, chunking/embedding policies,
    hybrid search, relevance/risk scoring, and feedback loops
  - Build agent orchestration systems for single and multi-agent workflows with planning,
    tool routing, shared memory, and inter-agent communication
  - Implement cloud-native infrastructure for large-scale model training and serving
    using Kubernetes, MLflow, Terraform, and AWS services
  - Embed compliance-by-design controls for HIPAA/CLIA/CAP/FDA/GDPR with PHI/PII handling,
    encryption, access controls, and audit trails
  use_cases:
  - Power internal workflows across R&D, Lab Ops, Clinical Trials, Billing, and Patient/Provider
    engagement using AI/ML platforms
  - Enable workflow automation through multi-agent architectures that can interact
    with internal systems and take action under strict controls
  - Generate automated reports and data synthesis for clinical and research applications
  - Support clinical innovation and patient outcomes through AI-powered decision support
    and engagement tools
  - Provide secure, compliant AI solutions for healthcare diagnostics and genetic
    testing workflows
