    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is directly building AI systems using LLMs,
      embeddings, and retrieval techniques to create an
      intelligence layer for data. The engineer will design and
      implement components for semantic search, code generation,
      and information retrieval - working hands-on with AI models
      rather than just supporting AI infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Shape the future of AI for data engineering by building intelligent systems that
    understand, reason about, and optimize the flow of data across organizations
  - Design and engineer the brain of Astronomer's context layer, crafting components
    that power data modeling, semantic search, retrieval, and code generation
  - Push the boundaries of applied AI by experimenting with LLMs, embeddings, and
    cutting-edge retrieval techniques to create developer tools
  - Turn research into reality by working with R&D and product teams to bring early
    AI concepts to life in the product experience
  - Solve high-impact information retrieval and search challenges at a global scale
    using Astronomer's visibility into data pipelines
  - Influence the technical vision and architecture for the next generation of AI-driven
    data products
  use_cases:
  - Global context layer for data providing intelligence across organizations from
    raw ingestion to production dashboards and AI products
  - AI-powered search and discovery enabling data practitioners to find and understand
    data across their organization
  - LLM-assisted code generation for data and analytics workflows, generating Python
    and SQL code against data platforms
  - Automated root cause analysis for data pipelines using AI to understand and diagnose
    data flow issues
  - Semantic information retrieval for data platforms allowing natural language queries
    over data infrastructure and metadata
