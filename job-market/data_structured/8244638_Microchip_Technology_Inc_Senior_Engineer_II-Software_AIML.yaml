  title: Senior Engineer II-Software AI/ML
  ai_type:
    type: ml-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves developing, implementing, and optimizing
      AI models for edge computing environments using TensorFlow,
      PyTorch, TFLite, and ONNX. While there's mention of cloud-
      based development, the core work is hands-on model
      development and tuning for edge AI hardware platforms, which
      aligns with traditional ML/DL work rather than LLM/agent
      development (ai-first) or supporting infrastructure (ai-
      support).
  responsibilities:
  - Develop AI models for edge computing environments using multiple programming languages
    and frameworks
  - Create and define AI models using TFLite, TensorFlow, ONNX, PyTorch, and C/C++
    based technologies
  - Design and implement AI/ML applications, models, and algorithms optimized for
    edge computing and cloud-based development
  - Develop and tune AI models for efficient execution on hardware platforms
  - Work with software engineering team to implement accelerated AI training software
    platforms
  - Collaborate with applications engineers on data gathering, applying, and evaluating
    for AI models on Edge AI hardware
  use_cases:
  - Edge AI model deployment on hardware platforms
  - AI applications optimized for edge computing environments
  - Resource-constrained device inference
  - Cloud-based AI development and application space
  - Edge-to-cloud integration for AI workloads
