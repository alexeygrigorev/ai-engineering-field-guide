    reasoning: |-
      This role is building infrastructure and platform tooling
      that enables others to work with AI/ML. The engineer is
      designing architecture, feature stores, model registries,
      and vector database patterns, while ensuring models move
      from notebooks to production APIs. They are NOT building,
      training, fine-tuning, or deploying models themselves - they
      are creating the platform and tooling that allows AI/ML
      Engineers and Data Scientists to do that work autonomously.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the evolution of Machine Learning & AI Platform, designing architecture for
    AI Agents and Vector Database patterns
  - Operationalize new Databricks AI features like Liquid Clustering and Agent Evaluation
    into stable platform capabilities
  - Establish GenAI governance guidelines to help teams transition from notebook experiments
    to production-grade LLM applications
  - Design and manage the Feature Store, Model Registry, Vector Search infrastructure,
    and RAG workflows
  - Mentor Staff and Senior engineers on design patterns, code quality, and architectural
    decisions
  - Translate complex ML/AI requirements into robust engineering tickets and infrastructure
    roadmaps
  use_cases:
  - Enabling large-scale ML model deployment from notebooks to production APIs
  - Providing Vector Database infrastructure for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
    workflows
  - Supporting AI Agent development and management through platform tooling
  - Facilitating traditional ML operations with Feature Store and Model Registry
  - Enabling GenAI governance and best practices for LLM application development
