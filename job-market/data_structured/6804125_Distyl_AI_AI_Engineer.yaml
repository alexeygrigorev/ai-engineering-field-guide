  title: AI Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is clearly an ai-first role as engineers are hands-on
      building, deploying, and fine-tuning LLM-powered systems
      including agents, RAG, and prompt orchestration. They work
      directly with models, not just supporting infrastructure or
      data pipelines for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and deploy robust LLM-powered GenAI systems including model evaluation,
    prompt design, and agent/agentic logic
  - Engage directly with customer stakeholders to understand business needs and deliver
    tailored high-impact AI solutions
  - Contribute to Distillery internal LLM platform development with reusable tools,
    infrastructure, and workflows
  - Ensure systems are observable, maintainable, and meet rigorous reliability, performance,
    and security standards
  - Lead evaluation efforts balancing accuracy, latency, explainability, cost, and
    robustness of AI systems
  - Refine development workflows, platform architecture, and deployment practices
    to raise engineering bar
  use_cases:
  - Powering core operational workflows for Fortune 500 companies across insurance,
    CPG, and non-profits
  - Deploying AI agents for long-horizon task execution with tool use and prompt orchestration
  - Implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems for enterprise knowledge
    access
  - Transforming mission-critical business workflows with measurable financial impact
  - Building human-in-the-loop feedback systems with observability and debugging capabilities
