    and access management
  - Identify and implement AI-assisted workflows that remove cognitive or manual load
    from teams
  - Work directly with business teams and leadership to understand operational constraints
    and deliver improvements
  - Ensure improvements are maintainable, clearly owned, and support organizational
    scale

    in business processes
