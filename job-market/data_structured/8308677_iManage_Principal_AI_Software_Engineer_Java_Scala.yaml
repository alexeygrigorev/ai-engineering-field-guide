    Intelligent document management platform for legal
    professionals
position:
  title: Principal AI Software Engineer (Java, Scala)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on AI engineering work including
      designing retrieval systems that bridge traditional search
      with semantic understanding for AI agents, prompt
      engineering, context engineering, and implementing hybrid
      search with vector embeddings. The engineer works directly
      with LLMs in production and takes ideas from research to
      deployment, which aligns with ai-first work on AI systems
      rather than just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Designing and implementing retrieval systems that bridge traditional search with
    modern semantic understanding, making legal documents accessible to AI agents
    at scale
  - Working directly with early adopter customers to understand their workflows, gather
    feedback, and rapidly iterate on solutions that solve their problems
  - Building and optimising production systems that handle thousands of concurrent
    queries while maintaining sub-second latency
  - Developing evaluation frameworks and metrics to continuously improve retrieval
    quality
  - Taking ownership of complex challenges end-to-end, from initial research through
    production deployment
  - Balancing research goals with practical engineering constraints, knowing when
    to leverage AI and when to build traditional solutions
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered document management and retrieval for legal documents
  - Semantic search that bridges traditional keyword search with vector embeddings
    for enhanced document discovery
  - Making legal documents accessible to AI agents at scale for automated workflows
  - Production systems serving millions of user queries with sub-second latency
  - Evaluation and continuous improvement of retrieval quality for legal document
    search
