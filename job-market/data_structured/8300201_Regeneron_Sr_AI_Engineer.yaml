      This role is titled "Senior Data Engineer, Machine Learning"
      and focuses on building backend services, data pipelines,
      and APIs that support AI work. While the job involves LLM
      integration, RAG architectures, and prompt engineering, the
      primary emphasis is on infrastructure (FastAPI, Kubernetes,
      AWS), data pipelines, and enabling ML engineers and data
      scientists rather than directly building, training, or fine-
      tuning models.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and maintain microservices using Python and FastAPI for AI and
    ML workflows
  - Build and optimize data ingestion pipelines for structured and unstructured data
    sources
  - Create secure, high-performance APIs for internal LLM access and integrate external
    LLMs
  - Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflows and manage vector databases
  - Deploy and manage services in AWS EKS Kubernetes clusters, ensuring scalability
    and resilience
  - Ensure backend services meet enterprise-grade performance, security, and compliance
    standards
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise AI solutions and backend services
  - LLM integration for internal access and workflows
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation architectures
  - Vector database management for RAG systems
  - Data ingestion pipelines for AI/ML workflows
