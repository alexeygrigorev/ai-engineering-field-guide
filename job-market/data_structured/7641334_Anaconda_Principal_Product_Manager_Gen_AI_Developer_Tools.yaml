    reasoning: |-
      This is a Product Manager role focused on building developer
      tools, infrastructure, and platforms that support AI
      workflows (MCP servers, APIs, SDKs, integration with AI
      IDEs). The role does not involve hands-on work building,
      training, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models - rather, it
      enables developers who build with AI by creating the tooling
      and integration layers around Anaconda's package management
      platform.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead product strategy and roadmap for Agentic Environment & Package Management
    initiatives, including MCP server development and AI tool integrations
  - Conduct strategic research with enterprise customers, AI tool vendors, and the
    open-source community to identify critical integration points and partnership
    opportunities
  - Drive the development and launch of tools and agents that improve the quality
    of Python vibe-coding
  - Support strategic partnerships with top AI-enabled IDEs (Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf,
    etc.) to ensure Anaconda integration becomes the default choice
  - Collaborate with engineering teams to build robust APIs, SDKs, and developer tools
    that enable seamless AI-to-Anaconda workflows
  - Work closely with enterprise customers in regulated industries to ensure AI infrastructure
    meets security and compliance requirements
  - Partner with marketing and developer relations to drive adoption among Python
    developers globally
  - Measure and optimize key metrics including developer adoption, enterprise package
    downloads, and AI tool integration usage
  use_cases:
  - AI-assisted Python coding and development workflows using tools like Cursor, GitHub
    Copilot, and Claude
  - Agentic environment management and package management for AI development
  - Enterprise-grade AI infrastructure with security and compliance for regulated
    industries (finance, healthcare, government)
  - Integration between AI coding tools and package management platforms via MCP (Model
    Context Protocol)
  - Seamless AI-to-Anaconda workflows enabling developers to build and deploy AI applications
