      This is a hands-on AI engineering role building secure
      infrastructure for agentic systems. The engineer will
      directly implement authentication patterns, build
      orchestration layers, deploy IDE agents, and create MCP
      servers - all core AI/ML systems work rather than general
      support infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Build unified, secure layer connecting AI tools like Copilot Agents, Gemini, Claude,
    and n8n workflows to core platforms through internal MCP servers
  - Fine-tune and deploy IDE agents that accelerate coding across the entire engineering
    organization
  - Create orchestration layers and secure runtime environments for LLM tool-use
  - Design security patterns for different levels of agent autonomy from Advisory
    (read-only) to Autonomous (action-taking) with Verifiable State and Revert mechanisms
  - Implement authentication, authorization, and human-in-the-loop safeguards for
    agentic access while maintaining Zero Trust principles
  - Build enterprise knowledge base to connect disparate data sources for agentic
    reasoning
  - Identify and target Units of Toil with appropriate AI abstractions, serving as
    expert on frontier tools to optimize team workflows
  use_cases:
  - Agentic systems interacting with real-world Bitcoin financial infrastructure and
    cloud platforms
  - IDE agents that accelerate software development workflows for engineering teams
  - Autonomous agents with tiered independence levels for read-only advisory to action-taking
    operations
  - Enterprise knowledge base connecting disparate data sources for agentic reasoning
    across systems
  - Internal MCP servers enabling secure agent interactions with core platform services
