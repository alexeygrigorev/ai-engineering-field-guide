    reasoning: |-
      This role involves building and deploying AI models,
      implementing agentic workflows, and owning the technical
      aspects of model deployment infrastructure. The focus is on
      hands-on engineering of AI systems (Overmind AI engine,
      MLOps, model deployment) rather than just providing
      supporting infrastructure or platforms for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Drive end-to-end technical architecture for Integra and Overmind platforms, making
    decisions on frameworks, technologies, and infrastructure
  - Lead technical design and implementation of complex systems including data pipelines,
    model deployment infrastructure, agentic workflows, and API integrations
  - Establish and champion best practices for software development, code quality,
    testing, and CI/CD while mentoring other engineers
  - Own the technical aspects of deploying, scaling, and maintaining AI models and
    platforms in production environments
  - Collaborate with AI Strategy & Innovation and Solution Architecture teams to translate
    advanced AI research into engineered solutions
  - Lead execution of complex, high-impact engineering projects delivering high-quality
    software with operational autonomy
  use_cases:
  - Overmind AI engine - core AI platform for blockchain enterprise applications
  - Viable Enterprise Operating System (Integra) - internal operating system platform
  - Agentic workflows - AI agent systems for automated task execution
  - Model deployment infrastructure - systems for deploying and scaling machine learning
    models
  - Data pipelines - infrastructure for data ingestion and processing for ML systems
  - API integrations - connecting AI services with enterprise applications
