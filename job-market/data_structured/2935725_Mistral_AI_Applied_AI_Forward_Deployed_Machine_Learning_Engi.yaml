    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      Forward Deployed Engineer role working directly on deploying
      GenAI solutions with hands-on LLM fine-tuning, RAG
      implementation, and agentic systems. The role involves
      building and deploying AI models to production, not just
      supporting them - explicitly mentions "complex fine-tuning",
      "LLM applications", and contributing to inference/fine-
      tuning codebases.
  responsibilities:
  - Deploy production AI solutions with measurable business impact across various
    industries
  - Implement state-of-the-art GenAI applications from consumer products to industrial
    use cases
  - Collaborate with researchers and engineers on complex projects involving LLM fine-tuning
    and advanced applications
  - Contribute to open-source codebases for inference and fine-tuning tasks
  - Engage in pre-sales calls to understand client needs and provide technical guidance
  - Work with product and science teams to improve model capabilities based on customer
    feedback
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise AI transformation and deployment across multiple industries
  - Consumer-facing GenAI product implementations
  - Industrial AI applications and automation
  - Custom LLM fine-tuning for enterprise-specific use cases
  - Advanced RAG systems for enterprise knowledge management
  - Agentic AI systems for autonomous task execution
