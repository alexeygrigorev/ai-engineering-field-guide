      provisioning, IaC, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud platform
      operations.

  - Develop automation-first solutions for cloud data services provisioning, integrating
    IAM, networking, security policies as code, and observability
  - Build and maintain Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD pipelines for cloud

  - Deploy and manage AWS services like EC2, S3, RDS, VPC, DMS, Redis, EMR, EKS for
    multi-tier, auto-scaling, high-availability architectures
  - Implement cloud security best practices, partner compatibility assessments, and
    continuous monitoring for performance and security
  - Enable AI-driven workflows for infrastructure monitoring, optimization, and predictive
    maintenance with orchestration experience
  - Estimate AWS usage costs, implement FinOps best practices, and deliver on cloud
    network administration, security, and optimization
