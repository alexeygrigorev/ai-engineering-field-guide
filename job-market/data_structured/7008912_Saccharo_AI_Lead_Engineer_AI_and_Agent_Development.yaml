      The role involves building, fine-tuning, and deploying open-
      weight LLMs, implementing RAG systems, and training
      collaborative agentic models. This is hands-on work directly
      on AI/ML systems, not just supporting infrastructure or data
      pipelines for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Build & maintain data pipelines for ingestion, cleaning, and embedding of unstructured
    proposal content
  - Prototype, fine-tune, and evaluate open-weight LLMs; implement retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG) for grounded answers
  - Deploy models behind scalable APIs and monitor latency, cost, and drift
  - Embed responsible-AI controls (e.g., privacy, transparency, bias checks)
  - Collaborate cross-functionally with product, sales, and customer SMEs to translate
    user pain points into ML-powered features
  - Mentor team members on best practices; contribute to engineering playbooks and
    code review rituals
  use_cases:
  - Ingest and process unstructured RFP documents to identify must-win opportunities
  - Generate AI-driven strategies and insights for sales proposals
  - Automate RFP response workflows to reduce manual copy-paste work
  - Provide grounded answers and content retrieval using RAG
  - Help proposal managers focus on high-value strategic thinking instead of administrative
    tasks
