      This role is directly building and fine-tuning LLMs through
      Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), preference optimization, and
      deploying agentic LLM systems. The engineer owns the end-to-
      end post-training lifecycle from data curation and training
      through deployment and monitoring, which is core AI model
      development work rather than supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) of large language models in production, shaping
    instruction-following, reasoning quality, tone, and domain-specific behavior
  - Extend SFT pipelines with instruction tuning and preference-based optimization
    using RLHF-style approaches or direct preference optimization
  - Design, curate, and maintain high-quality SFT and preference datasets combining
    human-labeled and synthetic data for marketing use cases
  - Own model evaluation and benchmarking including offline behavioral evals, online
    A/B tests, and continuous regression detection
  - Develop and operate agentic LLM systems enabling multi-step reasoning, tool use,
    workflow orchestration, and decision execution
  - Implement and optimize RAG, memory, and tool-calling strategies with clear understanding
    of when to solve problems via SFT versus prompting
  - Partner with cross-functional teams to integrate fine-tuned models into high-throughput,
    low-latency systems
  - Establish best practices for LLM versioning, experimentation, deployment, rollback,
    governance, and safety
  use_cases:
  - Marketing personalization at individual consumer level across multiple channels
  - Real-time bidding system handling over 100 billion events per day
  - Intelligent ad targeting to deliver the right advertisement to the right user
    at the right time
  - Agentic decision-making systems for marketing optimization
  - Real-time reporting and analytics on terabytes of marketing data
