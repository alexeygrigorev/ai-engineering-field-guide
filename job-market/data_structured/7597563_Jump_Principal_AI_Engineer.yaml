      This is an AI-first role focused on building and deploying
      AI/ML systems including RAG, vector databases, agentic
      workflows, and fine-tuning pipelines. The role requires
      hands-on experience with LLMs, model evaluation frameworks,
      and AI infrastructure, moving beyond enabling AI to directly
      implementing AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect, build, and maintain internal AI platform including model evaluation
    frameworks, experimentation, context management systems, and fine-tuning pipelines
  - Standardize and automate internal tooling including orchestration frameworks for
    AI agents and workflows
  - Design and deploy RAG systems, vector databases, and foundational components for
    production-grade AI systems
  - Define best practices for evaluation and benchmarking of models and agentic workflows
    across quality, reliability, latency, cost, and safety
  - Develop templates and libraries for agentic workflows, memory, and tool use
  - Partner cross-functionally with HR, Finance, and Client Services to design and
    deploy AI automations
  - Lead rapid experimentation initiatives to identify and prototype high-impact internal
    AI use cases
  - Mentor engineers and product teams on effective use of LLMs, model selection,
    and architecture design
  use_cases:
  - Internal AI platform and tools for engineering teams to experiment and deploy
    AI solutions
  - AI-powered workflow automation for non-engineering departments including HR, Finance,
    and Client Services
  - RAG systems and agentic workflows integrated into fan engagement products
  - Model evaluation and benchmarking frameworks for ensuring quality and reliability
    of AI systems
  - Productivity and automation tools that leverage LLMs across organizational functions
