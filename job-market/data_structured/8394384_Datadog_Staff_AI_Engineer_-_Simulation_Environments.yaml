position:
  title: Staff AI Engineer - Simulation Environments
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building simulation infrastructure and
      synthetic data pipelines to support AI agents, not directly
      training, fine-tuning, or deploying models. The position
      emphasizes distributed systems, backend engineering, and
      platform architecture that enables AI research teams to
      train and evaluate agents.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build high-fidelity simulation environments that model complex distributed
    systems with realism and scalability
  - Develop synthetic data generation tools and evaluation pipelines to train and
    assess AI agents across Datadog products
  - Collaborate with AI research and product engineering teams to integrate models
    into simulation and production workflows
  - Define architecture and technical direction for Datadog's emerging simulation
    platform
  - Mentor engineers and contribute to shaping the culture of a new, cross-functional
    team
  use_cases:
  - Safely train and evaluate AI agents in synthetic environments before production
    deployment
  - Create high-fidelity simulations of complex distributed systems for agent learning
    and reasoning
  - Generate synthetic data at scale to train and assess AI agents across Datadog
    products
  - Enable AI agents to learn observability and automation tasks in controlled simulation
    environments
  - Bridge the gap between AI research and production through integrated simulation
