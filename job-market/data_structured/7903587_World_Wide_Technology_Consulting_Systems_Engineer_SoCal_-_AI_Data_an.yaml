      This is a pre-sales consulting role focused on designing
      solution architectures and selling technology services

  - Develop Statements of Work, Proofs of Concept, Bills of Materials, and Level of
    Effort estimates
  - Partner with local Client Executives to build long-term customer relationships
  - Collaborate with ecosystem partners including Snowflake, Databricks, NVIDIA, cloud
    hyperscalers, and field engineering teams
  - Conduct POCs, demos, and ATC-backed workshops for customers
  - Support executive strategy conversations and hands-on technical workshops
  use_cases:
  - AI enablement and deployment architecture design for enterprise clients
  - Data pipeline and big data solution implementations
  - MLOps infrastructure and model lifecycle management
