      The role involves hands-on work building, prototyping, and
      deploying Generative AI systems including RAG architectures,
      agentic systems, and LLM-powered solutions. The developer
      directly implements AI technologies using frameworks like
      LangChain, LlamaIndex, and works with OpenAI/Anthropic APIs,
      not just supporting infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Experiment with Generative AI frameworks and tools including LangChain, LlamaIndex,
    Hugging Face, and OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
  - Build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prototypes using vector stores and
    knowledge graphs
  - Develop and test agentic architectures through the Genie Platform enabling AI
    agents that reason, retrieve and act across systems
  - Explore LLMOps, evaluation tools, and model observability platforms like TruLens
    and LangSmith
  - Deploy solutions on modern cloud and DevOps environments including AWS, Azure,
    and GCP
  - Integrate models with APIs, data sources, and production systems
  - Apply prompt and context engineering techniques for model optimization
  - Collaborate cross-functionally with teams and stakeholders using agile best practices
  use_cases:
  - Building RAG-based knowledge retrieval systems using vector databases and knowledge
    graphs
  - Developing AI agents that can reason, retrieve information, and take actions across
    multiple systems
  - Creating prototype Generative AI solutions for client projects across multiple
    sectors
  - Implementing LLM-powered applications using APIs from OpenAI and Anthropic
  - Deploying cloud-native AI solutions on AWS, Azure, or GCP infrastructure
  - Evaluating and monitoring GenAI systems using LLMOps tools and observability platforms
