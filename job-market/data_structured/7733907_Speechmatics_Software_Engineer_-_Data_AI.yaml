    Speech Intelligence using AI/ML to unlock business value in
    human speech worldwide
position:
  title: Software Engineer - Data & AI
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building data pipelines, web scraping
      infrastructure, and data management systems that power
      speech models - it's clearly working NEAR AI but not ON the
      AI models themselves. The engineer creates the datasets that
      ML Engineers use, handles data infrastructure, and optimizes
      data workflows, which is classic AI-support work enabling ML
      teams rather than direct model development.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and maintain scalable web scraping solutions to extract data from multiple
    sources
  - Design, implement and maintain scalable data pipelines for ingestion, transformation,
    and storage of large datasets for high-performance AI models
  - Ensure data quality and integrity through validation, cleaning, and normalisation
    processes
  - Manage data infrastructure, including databases, and cloud storage solutions
  - Optimise performance of scraping scripts and pipelines for speed, reliability,
    and scalability
  - Monitor and troubleshoot data workflows reliability and efficiency
  - Identify new opportunities to source or generate relevant datasets
  - Collaborate closely with ML Engineers to deliver richer data at bigger scale and
    lower cost to power next-generation models
  use_cases:
  - Powering state-of-the-art speech recognition models through large-scale, high-quality
    datasets
  - Enabling voice AI technology to unlock business value in human speech across global
    industries
  - Supporting cutting-edge speech intelligence projects that integrate into customer
    stacks irrespective of industry
  - Delivering data that shifts the cost/throughput/quality frontier for next-generation
    speech models
  - Extracting useful information from speech for business applications worldwide
