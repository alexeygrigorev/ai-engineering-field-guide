      This is a hands-on role directly building and deploying
      production-grade generative AI systems, including LLM
      integration patterns (RAG, function calling, agents) and
      foundation models. The role requires deep experience with AI
      orchestration frameworks and involves designing AI platforms
      for real clinical applications, not just supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Own the AI foundation that determines how AI shows up across mental healthcare
    at scale
  - Design core AI platforms and set technical standards for safety, reliability,
    and performance
  - Define system architecture and make principal decisions about introducing advanced
    AI into regulated care environments
  - Build production-grade generative AI systems that power patient engagement, provider
    workflows, and clinical operations
  - Design and implement LLM integration patterns including RAG, function calling,
    agents, and memory routing
  - Establish MLOps, data pipelines, evaluation, and observability systems for continuous
    model improvement
  - Act as a technical multiplier for other engineers and unblock complex engineering
    problems
  use_cases:
  - Patient engagement systems powered by generative AI for mental healthcare support
  - Provider workflow optimization using AI to streamline clinical operations and
    reduce administrative burden
  - Clinical decision support frameworks to assist mental health providers in delivering
    evidence-based care
  - Human-in-the-loop AI systems that enhance, not replace, clinical judgment in mental
    health treatment
  - Secure and compliant AI solutions that maintain HIPAA/GDPR standards while improving
    patient outcomes
