    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role is focused on building security infrastructure
      (API gateways, authorization frameworks) that supports AI
      systems rather than building AI models or agents themselves.
      The candidate will architect the MCP Gateway to enable safe
      AI adoption but is not deploying, fine-tuning, or building
      AI/ML systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead architecture of next-generation API security and authorization platforms
    for enterprise
  - Architect and govern the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Gateway as a secure bridge
    for AI agent access
  - Build robust Authorization frameworks and API Governance layers that scale for
    AI agent access patterns
  - Implement Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA) and context-aware policies for safe
    Generative AI adoption
  - Protect critical data sources against unauthorized AI access while enabling automation
  - Extend existing API security controls to the emerging AI ecosystem
  - Integrate security controls into CI/CD pipelines for API and AI gateway deployments
  use_cases:
  - Secure enterprise API access and authorization for human and AI agent users
  - Model Context Protocol (MCP) Gateway for connecting enterprise data to AI agents
  - Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA) for AI agent access control and governance
  - API security and governance platform supporting high-velocity AI agent access
    patterns
  - Context-aware policy enforcement for Generative AI applications
