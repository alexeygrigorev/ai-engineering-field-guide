    reasoning: |-
      This is a Forward Deploy Engineer who builds and deploys
      production AI solutions including RAG pipelines, agent
      systems, and fine-tuned models. The role involves hands-on
      implementation of retrieval-augmented generation, model
      optimization with LoRA/PEFT, and inference serving - all
      core AI/ML engineering work.
  responsibilities:
  - Partner with customer stakeholders to identify high-value AI use cases and define
    delivery plans
  - Build end-to-end prototypes including data connectors, RAG pipelines, prompts,
    tools, and UIs/APIs
  - Implement retrieval-augmented generation with chunking, embeddings, ranking, caching,
    and tool orchestration
  - Productionize AI solutions with CI/CD, infrastructure-as-code, security, and observability
  - Fine-tune and adapt models using LoRA/PEFT, DPO, and distillation; optimize inference
    with quantization, vLLM, and TensorRT-LLM
  - Monitor quality metrics, drift, hallucinations, latency, and costs; set up alerting
    and dashboards
  use_cases:
  - Secure RAG assistant over millions of documents with hybrid search and guardrails
  - High-volume customer support copilot with CRM/ITSM integration and strict response-time
    SLOs
  - Document intake pipeline with PII detection, redaction, and structured extraction
  - Fine-tuned classification and routing models to reduce human triage by 40%+
