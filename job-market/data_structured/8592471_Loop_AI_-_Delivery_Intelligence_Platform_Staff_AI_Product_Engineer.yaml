    reasoning: |-
      The role is a Staff Product Engineer with broad full-stack
      responsibilities. While it mentions "collaborating on AI-
      driven features" and "integrating models," the primary focus
      is on full-stack development (frontend, backend, APIs,
      architecture) rather than directly building, training, or
      deploying AI models. The AI work appears to be
      supporting/integrating AI systems built by others rather
      than hands-on model work.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead design and implementation of scalable frontend architecture using modern
    web technologies
  - Build and maintain backend systems and APIs to power core product functionality
  - Contribute to high-level architecture decisions across the stack and create scalable,
    maintainable systems
  - Partner with product managers, designers, and engineers to define and prioritize
    roadmap features
  - Collaborate on AI-driven features, integrating models or intelligent workflows
    into platform components
  - Help design systems that support data pipelines, model inference, and AI feedback
    loops
  - Mentor and guide team members, championing best practices and high engineering
    standards
  use_cases:
  - Restaurant workflow automation and optimization
  - Cost reduction for restaurant operations
  - Customer experience enhancement through intelligent automation
  - AI agentic workflows with orchestration, tool usage, and multi-step reasoning
  - Data pipeline and model inference systems for restaurant intelligence
