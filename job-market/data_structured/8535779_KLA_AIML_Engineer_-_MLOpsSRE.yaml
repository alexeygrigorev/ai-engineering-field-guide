    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is an MLOps/SRE role focused on building
      infrastructure, platforms, and tooling for ML/LLM systems.
      The role supports data science and engineering teams by
      implementing CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, observability, and
      deployment infrastructure, but does not involve building,
      training, or fine-tuning models directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement reusable MLOps platform capabilities for training, deployment,
    and monitoring of ML/LLM systems
  - Build standardized pipelines for data validation, feature generation, training,
    evaluation, model packaging, and release
  - Deploy models and AI services using containers and orchestration with robust rollout
    strategies
  - Implement end-to-end observability including structured logging, metrics, tracing,
    dashboards, and alerting
  - Implement monitoring for model quality and data health including drift, bias,
    performance degradation, and data pipeline anomalies
  - Integrate security best practices including secrets management, RBAC, network
    controls, and vulnerability scanning
  - Partner with data science and engineering teams to translate business requirements
    into reliable, scalable ML solutions
  - Create developer-friendly documentation, templates, and internal best practices
    for MLOps and reliability standards
  use_cases:
  - Production ML infrastructure for semiconductor manufacturing analytics
  - Automated ML model deployment and serving at scale
  - Model quality monitoring and drift detection
  - Data pipeline observability and anomaly detection
  - Enterprise AI governance and compliance
  - High-throughput inference services for manufacturing systems
