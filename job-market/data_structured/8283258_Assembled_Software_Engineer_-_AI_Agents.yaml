    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is hands-on building autonomous AI agents and
      working directly with LLMs. The engineer will implement RAG
      systems, improve model performance with vector search and
      re-ranking, and build infrastructure for LLM integration -
      all core AI development work.
  responsibilities:
  - Build foundational new features like translation capabilities powered by LLMs
    and intelligent ticket categorization
  - Design and build a workflow builder that simplifies complex workflows for support
    agents
  - Enhance RAG engine using vector search, document re-ranking, and hypothetical
    document embeddings
  - Architect abstractions for integrating various LLM types and implement evaluation
    and logging systems
  - Collaborate with customers including support agents and managers to understand
    needs and improve product interactions
  - Contribute to multiple areas including coding, user research, planning, brainstorming,
    interviewing, and cross-team collaboration
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous AI agents that resolve customer support cases end-to-end
  - AI Copilot for agent assistance to help human agents send faster, more accurate
    replies
  - Translation capabilities powered by LLMs for multilingual support
  - Intelligent categorization of incoming customer support tickets
  - RAG-based knowledge retrieval using past tickets, macros, and document embeddings
  - AI-powered workforce management optimizing both human and AI capacity
