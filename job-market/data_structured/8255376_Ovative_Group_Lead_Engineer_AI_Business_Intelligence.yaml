      This is a hands-on technical role responsible for building
      and deploying a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system
      from scratch. The engineer will directly implement AI
      components including document ingestion, vector databases,
      semantic modeling, and orchestration of model interactions -
      not just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Serve as the technical owner of Ovative's RAG-based AI Analytics Platform, leading
    the system from initial design through production use
  - Partner with Product Management to translate ambiguous business questions into
    clear platform capabilities, framing technical tradeoffs and business outcomes
  - Design and build new platform components including document ingestion and storage
    services, indexing and vector database capabilities, semantic layer abstractions,
    and orchestration logic
  - Lead integrations with enterprise systems including authentication/authorization
    (SSO, entitlements), knowledge sources (Confluence, internal file stores), and
    user interfaces (Slack, EMRge, BI tools)
  - Apply established RAG and AI analytics patterns to prevent hallucinations, enforce
    business logic, and ensure traceability of answers
  - Follow technical standards for AI safety, access control, observability, and cost
    management
  - Break down complex platform initiatives into sequenced work that a small engineering
    team can execute effectively
  - Mentor other engineers by transferring context and patterns as the platform matures
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise analytics platform that provides AI-driven insights and recommendations
    from complex datasets
  - RAG-based system for querying business intelligence data and documentation with
    semantic search capabilities
  - Integration with business tools (Confluence, Slack, EMRge) to surface insights
    through familiar user interfaces
  - Marketing measurement and media optimization through holistic data analysis and
    AI-powered recommendations
