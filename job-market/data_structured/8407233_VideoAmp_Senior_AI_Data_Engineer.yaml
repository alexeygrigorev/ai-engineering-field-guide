      This role involves building and productionizing LLM-powered
      systems and integrating them directly into data pipelines.
      The engineer will own the end-to-end AI lifecycle, combining
      LLMs with ML models for specific business problems like
      network schedules and viewership logs.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and operate AI- and LLM-enabled data pipelines processing billions of linear
    and digital records
  - Build and productionize LLM-driven systems for network schedules, hourly viewership
    logs, and commercial metadata
  - Combine LLMs with rules, heuristics, and ML models to ensure deterministic, auditable
    outcomes
  - Integrate LLMs responsibly into batch and event-driven workflows, balancing accuracy,
    latency, and cost
  - Build human-in-the-loop workflows for high-impact or low-confidence cases
  - Collaborate with Measurement, Identity, Library, and Product teams to translate
    data issues into scalable AI solutions
  - Provide technical leadership through design reviews, mentorship, and architectural
    guidance
  use_cases:
  - Process network-specific schedules and program metadata for linear TV
  - Handle hourly viewership logs that vary by partner, format, and quality
  - Extract and structure commercial and ad spot metadata
  - Enable audience measurement, currency, and identity workflows across linear and
    digital media
  - Detect and explain data quality issues in measurement pipelines
  - Make measurement pipelines adaptive to partner-specific formats
