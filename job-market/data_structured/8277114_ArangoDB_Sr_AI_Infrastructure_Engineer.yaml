    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role is focused on building, maintaining, and
      stabilizing AI infrastructure services rather than building,
      training, or deploying AI models. The responsibilities
      center on infrastructure components like MLflow, Triton,
      Docker, Kubernetes, observability, and CI/CD pipelines that
      enable AI work but don't involve hands-on model development.
  responsibilities:
  - Maintain, develop, and stabilize AI infrastructure services
  - Architect and implement foundational services and shared libraries for AI infrastructure
    ecosystem
  - Debug complex production issues across application, process, network, and memory
    layers
  - Improve observability, profiling, and tracing across distributed microservices
  - Operate and improve systems running on Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm
  - Support CI/CD pipelines (CircleCI), testing, and security-relevant components
  use_cases:
  - Building and scaling AI-powered applications with contextual enterprise data
  - Enabling graph-based Contextual AI with unified graph, vector, document, and key-value
    data
  - Providing System of Context to bridge enterprise data and LLMs
  - Supporting Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG workflows
  - Delivering enterprise AI with unlimited scale and cost efficiency
