    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work with AI systems including
      prompting strategies, reasoning approaches, model
      optimization, and agentic architectures. The engineer
      directly experiments with and implements cutting-edge AI
      techniques, integrates LLM APIs, and deploys models to
      production.
  responsibilities:
  - Drive the identification and prioritization of high-potential AI experiments based
    on new research developments
  - Build and maintain comprehensive experimentation infrastructure for AI-facilitated
    experiments at scale with A/B testing capabilities
  - Drive high-impact product releases powered by AI innovations, translating research
    into shipped features
  - Accelerate engineering adoption of AI capabilities by integrating AI tooling into
    internal workflows
  - Establish a culture of AI expertise and knowledge sharing through research dissemination
    and fast-follow implementation
  use_cases:
  - AI system evaluation and discovery platform using decentralized approaches
  - Scalable AI evaluation infrastructure combining AI evals with A/B testing
  - Agentic architectures and reasoning systems for AI-powered product features
  - Internal AI tooling integration to enhance engineering workflows
  - Context engineering and prompt optimization for improved model performance
