      The role explicitly requires training, fine-tuning, and
      deploying AI/ML models and integrating them into production
      applications. While this is primarily a full-stack position,

  - Integrate backend services using TanStack/React-Query for data fetching and caching
  - Build and manage robust RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express.js
  - Create and optimize databases using PostgreSQL, ensuring data integrity, security,
    and performance
  - Implement authentication, authorization, and secure data handling using OAuth
    and JWT
  - Train, fine-tune, and deploy AI/ML models, integrating them into full-stack applications
  - Prepare and manage datasets for AI model evaluation and production readiness
  - Deploy and monitor AI models in cloud environments using AWS or GCP
  use_cases:
  - Building cutting-edge software solutions for startups and enterprises
  - Developing multilingual interfaces for global audiences using i18next
  - Implementing secure payment flows using Stripe for e-commerce applications
  - Integrating AI-powered features and third-party APIs into production applications
  - Real-time notifications and user feedback systems
  - Full-stack applications with server-side rendering and static site generation
