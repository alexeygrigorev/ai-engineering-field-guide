      This role is directly building and optimizing AI agent
      systems, specifically focusing on context management, RAG
      implementations, and agent memory systems. The engineer is
      implementing the technical foundation for how AI agents
      reason and operate, not just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and implement adaptive context curation pipelines that determine what
    information enters each agent inference step
  - Invent and operationalize memory compaction mechanisms and state management patterns
    for agents across extended teaching workflows
  - Design evaluation pipelines that measure retrieval precision, token relevance,
    and reasoning coherence across sessions
  - Build dynamic runtime data fetching systems for agents to autonomously pull relevant
    curriculum content and educational resources
  - Engineer token-efficient tool APIs and retrieval layers with robust metadata to
    guide agent decision-making
  - Partner with Product, Research, and Education teams to translate educational workflows
    into optimal context configurations
  - Collaborate with ML researchers and platform engineers to co-design architectures
    integrating memory modules and retrieval adapters
  - Guide engineers on context engineering patterns including holistic context management
    and token budget awareness
  use_cases:
  - Lesson planning and curriculum development assistance for teachers
  - Differentiation and personalized learning support for diverse student needs
  - Assessment creation and automated grading workflows
  - Educational content retrieval and knowledge management for classroom scenarios
  - Multi-turn conversational AI assistance with maintained context across teaching
    workflows
  - Real-time access to curriculum standards and educational resources during instruction
