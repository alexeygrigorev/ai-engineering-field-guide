  title: AI Infrastructure Engineer, Core Infrastructure

    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role builds infrastructure and orchestration systems
      that support ML workloads rather than directly working on
      AI/ML models. The engineer focuses on compute allocation,
      scheduling, autoscaling, and platform architecture for ML
      teams, which is infrastructure that enables AI work but is
      not AI development itself.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and maintain fault-tolerant, cost-efficient systems for compute allocation,
    scheduling, and autoscaling across clusters and clouds
  - Build common abstractions and APIs that unify job submission, telemetry, and observability
    across serving and training workloads
  - Develop systems for usage metering, cost attribution, and quota management for
    compute budgets
  - Improve reliability and efficiency of large-scale GPU workloads through scheduling,
    bin-packing, preemption, and resource sharing
  - Partner with ML engineers and API teams to identify bottlenecks and define long-term
    architectural standards
  - Lead projects end-to-end from requirements gathering and design to rollout and
    monitoring in cross-functional environment
  use_cases:
  - Orchestration of ML compute workloads across heterogeneous GPU, CPU, on-prem,
    and cloud environments
  - Large-scale model training and evaluation infrastructure
  - Large-scale inference and experimentation platforms
  - Multi-tenant compute platform for internal ML teams
  - GPU scheduling and resource optimization for ML workloads
