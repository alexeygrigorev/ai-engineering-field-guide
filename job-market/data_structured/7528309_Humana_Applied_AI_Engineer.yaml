    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work with LLMs and generative AI
      technologies, including implementing Retrieval-Augmented
      Generation and generative AI agents. The engineer will
      directly build, deploy, and maintain AI-powered solutions
      working with models, not just supporting infrastructure for
      others.
  responsibilities:
  - Explore and implement generative AI technologies using Large Language Models and
    other generative models to create innovative solutions
  - Build and maintain robust APIs for enabling Retrieval-Augmented Generation and
    generative AI agents within business use cases
  - Design, develop, and maintain robust data pipelines for ingestion, processing,
    and transformation of large datasets
  - Assist the data science team in the development and deployment of traditional
    machine learning models
  - Collaborate with data scientists to understand model requirements and translate
    them into scalable engineering solutions
  - Monitor and maintain performance and reliability of deployed APIs, models, and
    data pipelines
  use_cases:
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation applications for business use cases
  - Generative AI agents for healthcare and insurance operations
  - Large-scale data processing and transformation for ML/AI workflows
  - Traditional machine learning model deployment for business analytics
  - API-driven AI solutions for internal stakeholders
