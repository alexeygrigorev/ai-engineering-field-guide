      This role involves hands-on work with LLMs, including
      applying them directly to build product features,
      integrating with multiple LLM providers, and managing model
      selection and routing. While there's a
      platform/infrastructure component, the engineer is actively
      building and deploying AI solutions rather than just

    features, working closely with product and engineering teams
  - Build and maintain robust APIs and backend systems that enable seamless integration
    of AI-powered features into ClickUp's core platform
  - Develop infrastructure for model serving, monitoring, logging, and automated evaluation
    to ensure high reliability and performance of AI services
  - Integrate with multiple LLM providers and manage model selection, routing, and
    fallback strategies for optimal performance and cost
  - Drive the adoption of best practices in AI privacy, security, and compliance,
    including data anonymization and regulatory adherence
  - Optimize platform performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency, leveraging cloud-native
    technologies and distributed systems
  use_cases:
  - Context-driven AI workspace that unifies tasks, docs, chat, calendar, and enterprise
    search
  - Intelligent features powered by LLMs across ClickUp's productivity platform
  - AI-driven applications integrating search technologies for enhanced user experience
  - Productivity tools that help teams break free from silos and reclaim time
  - Enterprise search capabilities supercharged by AI for improved information retrieval
