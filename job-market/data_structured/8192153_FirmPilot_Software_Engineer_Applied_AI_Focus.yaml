      This role involves hands-on work designing and implementing
      RAG pipelines, developing prompt strategies for multi-step
      agent workflows, and directly integrating LLMs into
      production systems. The engineer works directly ON AI
      systems (RAG, agents, prompt engineering) rather than just
      supporting infrastructure or general SWE for an AI company.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, implement, and evolve RAG pipelines combining structured data, embeddings,
    and LLMs
  - Develop and maintain prompt strategies used across multi-step agent workflows
  - Integrate LLMs into production systems with attention to reliability, cost, and
    latency
  - Orchestrate AI-driven workflows across internal services and third-party APIs
  - Define and improve practices for prompt versioning, evaluation, and iteration
  - Work closely with platform engineers to ensure AI systems are maintainable and
    observable
  use_cases:
  - Automating and scaling real-world business outcomes using AI
  - Production-grade automation using large language models
  - AI-driven workflow orchestration across services and APIs
  - Reliable, cost-effective, and low-latency LLM integration in production
  - Applied AI systems combining structured data with embeddings and LLMs
