      This is a hands-on technical role requiring direct design,
      building, and deployment of ML models including GNNs, LSTMs,
      and LLMs. The role involves owning model architecture from
      feature pipelines to high-performance serving and applying
      advanced techniques like deep learning, NLP, and agentic
      systems to solve risk detection problems.
  responsibilities:
  - Own full technical ownership of core risk domains such as Scams or Account Takeover,
    including designing, building, and leading strategy for all models in the domain
  - Lead system design and architecture for complex risk detection models, from feature
    pipeline design to model selection and high-performance serving
  - Translate ambiguous business needs into clear technical roadmaps, serving as the
    primary technical voice defining implementation approach
  - Act as technical leader and mentor for mid-level and junior engineers through
    code reviews, design docs, and coaching
