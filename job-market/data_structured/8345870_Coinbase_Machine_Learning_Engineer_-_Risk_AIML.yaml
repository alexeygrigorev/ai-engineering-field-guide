  title: Machine Learning Engineer - Risk AI/ML
  ai_type:
    type: ml-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is a hands-on ML engineering role focused on building,
      training, and deploying risk detection models using
      traditional ML techniques (deep learning, GNNs, sequence
      modeling). While LLMs are mentioned as a "nice to have" for
      conversational agents, the core work involves training
      models for fraud detection, scam prevention, and account
      takeover risk—classic ML applications. The role explicitly
      states "focusing 100% on modeling, not infrastructure
      plumbing" which aligns with ml-first classification.
  responsibilities:
  - Own end-to-end development of ML models from ideation to production using centralized
    ML platform
  - Enhance core risk models including Scam Models, Transaction Risk Models, Withdrawal
    Limit Models, and Account Takeover models
  - Build, train, and deploy ML models targeting production timelines under one week
    in response to new threat data
  - Develop production-grade AI/ML models and pipelines enabling real-time predictions
    using automated CI/CD and feature store
  - Apply modern ML methodologies including deep learning, NLP, Graph Neural Networks,
    sequence modeling, and LLMs to solve crypto-native challenges
  - Build adaptive context-aware risk systems that determine appropriate friction
    (quizzes, LLM agents, human review) for different user types
  - Collaborate with Risk Operations, Platform Engineering, and Product teams to close
    feedback loop and convert threats into automated defenses
  use_cases:
  - Fraud prevention and detection for cryptocurrency transactions and accounts
  - Account takeover protection for millions of Coinbase users
  - Scam detection models to protect customers from fraudulent schemes
  - Real-time risk scoring for transfers, withdrawals, and transaction limits
  - Adaptive security systems balancing fraud prevention with user experience
  - Future products like instant guest checkout and Coinbase Cards
