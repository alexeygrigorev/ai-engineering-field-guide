  name: Traversal
  stage: Seed
  focus: AI-powered site reliability and incident management
position:
  title: AI Engineer - AI Platform
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves building agent infrastructure,
      orchestration layers, and evaluation systems for AI agents,
      including multi-agent orchestration and toolkits. The work
      directly impacts AI system performance through building,
      evaluating, and deploying agentic architectures, not just
      supporting others who work on AI.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build agent frameworks, orchestration layers, and developer tooling
    for Traversal's AI agents
  - Architect scalable distributed systems to support real-time workloads over petabytes
    of heterogeneous telemetry data
  - Build live evaluation pipelines, automated scoring systems, and benchmarks to
    measure and drive AI performance
  - Integrate evaluation systems into the developer lifecycle to create a fast research-to-production
    loop
  - Surface evaluation signals and benchmarks to customers as a core product capability
  - Partner with research scientists to prototype and productionize agentic architectures
  - Own observability, latency, and reliability for agents in production
  - Evolve and scale the agent and evaluation platform as the backbone of Traversal's
    AI systems
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered root cause analysis for production incidents
  - Automated alert triage and incident remediation
  - Chat interface for infrastructure and telemetry data interaction
  - Prevention of complex production incidents through proactive AI analysis
  - Evaluation and benchmarking of AI agent performance in incident management
  - Real-time analysis of petabytes of telemetry data for operational insights
