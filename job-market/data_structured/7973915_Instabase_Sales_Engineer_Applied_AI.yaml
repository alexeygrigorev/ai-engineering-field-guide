    reasoning: |-
      This is a Sales Engineer role that demonstrates and
      configures AI solutions using Instabase's no-code platform
      rather than building, training, or deploying models
      directly. The role focuses on applying existing AI tools
      (prompt engineering, agentic workflows, RAG) through drag-
      and-drop interfaces, not hands-on model development or
      engineering.
  responsibilities:
  - Partner with Account Executives to uncover customer pains and translate them into
    AI automation designs using Instabase's platform
  - Design and configure Proofs of Concept (POCs) using drag-and-drop workflow builders
    and AI toolsets to demonstrate real-time data processing
  - Educate customers on prompt engineering best practices, agentic workflows, and
    AI governance without discussing low-level model weights
  - Provide primary feedback to Product Management on user interface and agent capabilities
    to refine the no-code tools
  use_cases:
  - Processing and extracting structured insights from unstructured data sources like
    documents, emails, and chats
  - Automating workflows for invoices, medical records, and financial statements to
    structure messy datasets
  - Building AI-powered solutions for large enterprises to solve previously unsolvable
    unstructured data problems
  - Enabling organizations to deploy AI workforces and intelligent automation without
    coding
