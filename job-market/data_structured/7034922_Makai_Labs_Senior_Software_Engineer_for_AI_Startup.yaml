      This is a backend software engineer role at an AI company
      that focuses on Flask, Python, and microservices
      architecture. The role involves building general software
      infrastructure and applications, not directly building,
      training, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models. While
      supporting client discovery processes, the work is enabling
      technology for an AI product rather than hands-on AI/ML
      development.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop new features using Flask for backend applications
  - Optimize applications for maximum speed and scalability
  - Ensure the technical feasibility of UI/UX designs
  - Collaborate with frontend developers and web designers to improve usability
  - Write robust, clean, and documented code
  - Maintain and enhance existing applications
  - Conduct performance tests and ensure responsiveness and stability across all platforms
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise automation through pre-built components and modules
  - Human-machine teaming interface for operational and strategic challenges
  - Workflow documentation and process diagramming from client discovery
  - Client workflow analysis and process mapping
  - Solutions that adapt to people rather than requiring people to adapt to software
