    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work building, deploying, and
      scaling AI solutions using LLMs, GenAI approaches, and deep
      learning. The engineer directly works on RAG pipelines,
      vector databases, model deployment, and productionizing AI
      solutions - all core AI/ML development activities rather
      than supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and deploy enterprise-ready AI solutions using LLMs, GenAI approaches, and
    deep learning capabilities
  - Scale out AI solutions through performance optimization, deployment automation,
    and testing
  - Rapidly prototype and iterate on AI applications using Azure, AWS, and off-the-shelf
    tools
  - Develop APIs and lightweight UIs using Dash, Flask and others to deliver AI tools
    to end users
  - Implement XOps engineering for AI including building, extending, and optimizing
    pipelines to productionize AI solutions
  - Stay current on emerging AI technologies including vector databases, RAG pipelines,
    and productivity AI platforms
  - Partner with AI Solutions Architect to ensure scalable, secure, and compliant
    system design
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise AI productivity solutions and productivity tools
  - RAG-based knowledge retrieval and question answering systems
  - LLM-powered applications for clinical and pharmaceutical use cases
  - Deep learning solutions for precision medicine workflows
  - Scalable AI platforms for regulated healthcare environments
