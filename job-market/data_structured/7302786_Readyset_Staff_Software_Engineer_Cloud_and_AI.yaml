    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is hands-on building AI-native infrastructure
      including retrieval pipelines, memory systems, agent
      orchestration, and LLM integration. The engineer will work
      directly on embedding, reranking, and agent systems, not
      just supporting tools for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and own critical services, developing robust, scalable, and simple-to-operate
    production systems
  - Lead high-impact architectural decisions balancing speed with engineering for
    3–4 9s availability
  - Work across the stack from distributed cloud infrastructure to AI-driven features
    like retrieval, memory, and agent orchestration
  - Collaborate with leadership and product teams to translate ambitious ideas into
    reality quickly
  - Act as a technical leader by mentoring engineers, driving engineering culture,
    and shaping development practices
  - Contribute to Readyset's engineering strategy and vision beyond individual projects
  use_cases:
  - Building AI-native cloud infrastructure powering data-intensive products
  - Ensuring data freshness for AI systems to maintain user trust and prevent stale
    results
  - Designing structured retrievable memory systems for reliable long-term agent behavior
  - Optimizing AI system costs through batching, caching, and smart model routing
    for re-embedding, reranker passes, and LLM calls
  - Deploying production-grade AI systems that are responsive, reliable, and affordable
    at enterprise scale
