  - Build, ship, and iterate on AI-powered features end to end
  - Design and deploy machine learning models that solve real problems
  - Work closely with product and engineering to turn ideas into working software
  - Integrate models into production systems including APIs, services, and workflows
  - Experiment with new tools, models, and approaches and keep what works
  - Improve performance, reliability, and scalability as we grow
  use_cases:
  - Replace slow, manual processes with intelligent systems
  - Build AI systems that think, adapt, and improve over time
  - Solve real-world problems with machine learning models
