    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building ML inference runtimes and
      platform infrastructure that enables ML teams to deploy and
      operate models, rather than building, training, or fine-
      tuning models directly. The engineer works on the serving
      layer, optimization, and operationalization of ML systems to
      support other teams who work on AI/ML.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect, build, and maintain ML inference runtimes for multi-model serving,
    autoscaling, and GPU/TPU utilization
  - Optimize inference pipelines and platform services for performance, reliability,
    and scalability
  - Lead deployment, operationalization, and maintenance of ML workloads in collaboration
    with ML and data science teams
  - Shape and maintain core platform services, including authentication, security,
    and notifications
  - Define scalable system architectures and guide cross-team design alignment
  - Develop benchmarking, validation, and monitoring tools to measure and maintain
    system performance
  use_cases:
  - Serving machine learning models at scale for a global streaming platform
  - Enabling multi-model inference runtimes with GPU/TPU acceleration
  - Providing platform infrastructure for authentication, security, and notification
    services
  - Deploying and operationalizing ML workloads for production environments
  - Supporting intelligent features and experiences for anime streaming users
