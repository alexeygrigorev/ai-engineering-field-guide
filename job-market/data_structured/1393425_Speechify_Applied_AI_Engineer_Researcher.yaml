      The role focuses on building text-to-speech and image
      generation models using deep learning frameworks. The core
      work involves developing TTS systems and NLP/CV models,
      which aligns with traditional ML engineering rather than
      building LLM/agent applications or supporting AI
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Research and implement state-of-the-art techniques in NLP, TTS, or CV with focus
    on image generation
  - Build and develop human-sounding AI speech models
  - Deploy NLP or TTS models to production at large scale
  - Manage engineers and grow the research & development team
  use_cases:
  - Text-to-speech conversion for various content types (PDFs, books, articles, websites)
  - Generating human-like AI speech voices
  - Image generation for content
  - Accessibility tools for reading and learning
