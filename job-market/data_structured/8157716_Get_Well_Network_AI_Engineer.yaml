  title: AI Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      Role involves hands-on work with LLMs including training,
      fine-tuning, and deploying unimodal and multimodal models.
      The engineer directly builds, optimizes, and deploys AI
      systems rather than just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Fine-tune and evaluate LLMs for real-world healthcare use cases using PEFT and
    LoRA techniques
  - Build multimodal AI systems integrating text, structured medical data, and images
    for clinical applications
  - Optimize models for accuracy, latency, and resource efficiency in production environments
  - Implement speech-to-text and text-to-speech models into conversational interfaces
    and voice assistants
  - Process and curate large-scale healthcare datasets with HIPAA and GDPR compliance
    controls
  - Evaluate model bias, drift, explainability, and reliability using benchmarks and
    human-in-the-loop validation
  use_cases:
  - Precision care delivery and patient engagement optimization
  - Clinical voice assistants and conversational AI interfaces for healthcare
  - Multimodal AI analysis integrating medical images, text, and structured data
  - Healthcare operational efficiency through AI-driven automation
  - Real-time patient care orchestration using AI-native intelligence
