    Golang, Python, Java, or similar technologies
  - Architect and deploy highly distributed systems using microservices ensuring scalability,
    resilience, and seamless integration
  - Integrate AI-driven decision-making into backend systems and deployment pipelines
    for automated monitoring and remediation
  - Optimize applications for maximum speed and scalability while ensuring system
    reliability through monitoring and observability tools
  use_cases:
  - Cybersecurity threat detection and fraud prevention using AI and machine learning
  - AI-assisted monitoring and anomaly detection for proactive issue identification
  - Automated remediation processes through intelligent operational workflows
  - AI-driven decision-making integration into backend systems and deployment pipelines
  - LLM-based agent workflows for autonomous operational processes
  - Cybersecurity analytics products protecting against cyber criminals and fraudsters
