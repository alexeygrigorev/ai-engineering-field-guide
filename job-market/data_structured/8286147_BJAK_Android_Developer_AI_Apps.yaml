      This role focuses on building Android applications that
      consume AI features via backend APIs rather than building,
      training, or deploying models. While it involves TensorFlow
      Lite for on-device inference, the primary work is mobile app
      development for AI-powered applications, making it AI-
      support rather than ai-first.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and maintain production Android apps using Kotlin
  - Integrate AI-powered features including chat, vision, voice, and recommendations
    via backend APIs
  - Design UX patterns for AI interactions including streaming responses, retries,
    and partial results
  - Optimize performance, memory usage, and responsiveness for AI-heavy application
    flows
  - Implement analytics, logging, and feedback capture to support AI evaluation and
    iteration
  - Collaborate with backend and ML engineers on API contracts and system behavior
  - Ensure app stability, security, and scalability in production environments
  use_cases:
  - Proactive AI system integrated across daily conversations, tools, and workflows
  - AI-powered chat interfaces with streaming response capabilities
  - Vision and speech AI features for mobile applications
  - Recommendation systems integrated into mobile user experiences
  - On-device AI inference using TensorFlow Lite for mobile performance
