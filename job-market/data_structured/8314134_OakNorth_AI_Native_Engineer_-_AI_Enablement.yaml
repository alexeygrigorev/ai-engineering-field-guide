    reusable patterns
  - Create agents for log inspection, bug detection, performance monitoring, and automated
    pull request fixes
  - Integrate AI capabilities into CI/CD pipelines, observability, and developer tooling
  - Partner with product and engineering teams to enable safe and effective AI adoption
  - Balance rapid experimentation and prototyping with production-quality delivery
  use_cases:
  - AI-assisted code generation, refactoring, and review to accelerate development
    workflows
  - Automated documentation generation and maintenance using AI
  - AI-powered test generation and quality validation
  - Agents that inspect logs and metrics to identify bugs, risks, and performance
    issues
  - AI-assisted review of design documents and architectural decisions
