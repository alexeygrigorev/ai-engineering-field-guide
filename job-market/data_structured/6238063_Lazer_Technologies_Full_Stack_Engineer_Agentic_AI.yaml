position:
  title: Full Stack Engineer, Agentic AI
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is an ai-first role because the engineer works directly
      on AI systems: hosting, tuning, and managing LLM services,
      creating agentic workflows and MCP servers, building AI-
      powered features like chatbots and information extraction,
      and fine-tuning LLMs. The role requires hands-on
      implementation of prompt engineering and structured
      experimentation workflows, and involves applying LLMOps best
      practices for testing, monitoring, and reliability.
  responsibilities:
  - Engage with clients to understand their problems, needs, goals, and technical
    environments
  - Architect, build, and ship full stack applications that leverage AI and data capabilities
  - Apply best practices in MLOps or LLMOps, including testing, monitoring, and reliability
  - Design and build scalable data pipelines and data lakes as needed
  - Communicate tradeoffs and risks transparently, supporting client decision-making
  - Collaborate with other engineers and cross-functional teams to deliver impactful
    results
  - Stay current with the latest AI trends, technologies, and tooling to bring innovation
    to projects
  use_cases:
  - Information extraction from documents using AI-powered features
  - Chatbot implementations leveraging agentic workflows and LLMs
  - Document construction and generation using generative AI
  - Search functionality enhanced with AI capabilities
  - Data normalization using LLM-based processing
  - Image or video generation using generative AI models
