      This role involves hands-on work directly with LLMs
      including prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, deployment,
      and integration into enterprise applications. The Principal
      Engineer will implement AI solutions using RAG, vector
      databases, and embeddings rather than just supporting
      infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement complex, scalable, and secure applications using Java, Python,
    and other high-level languages
  - Develop and refine prompt engineering strategies for LLM-based applications and
    integrate Large Language Models into products
  - Perform model fine-tuning and deployment while optimizing system performance and
    troubleshooting critical issues
  - Prototype and evaluate new AI tools and methodologies including vector databases,
    embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
  - Provide architectural guidance and ensure adherence to best practices across systems
  - Advocate for automation, testing, and continuous integration practices while ensuring
    compliance with security and regulatory standards
  use_cases:
  - LLM-powered applications for financial services leveraging prompt engineering
    and model fine-tuning
  - Enterprise AI integration with vector databases and retrieval-augmented generation
    (RAG) for enhanced information retrieval
  - AI-driven products and workflows for financial markets infrastructure and data
