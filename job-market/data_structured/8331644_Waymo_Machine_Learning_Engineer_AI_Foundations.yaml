    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves building and training large-scale ML
      models for autonomous driving systems, applying cutting-edge
      approaches including deep learning, reinforcement learning,
      imitation learning, and generative models. The engineer
      directly works on model development, deployment, and real-
      time inference on vehicles.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, train, and evaluate large-scale ML models used throughout Waymo's systems,
    both onboard autonomous vehicles and offboard in simulation
  - Frame open-ended real-world problems as well-defined ML problems and develop cutting-edge
    ML approaches including deep learning, reinforcement learning, and imitation learning
  - Scale ML solutions to Google-sized data pipelines and streamline them to run in
    real-time on vehicles
  - Collaborate with ML infrastructure, data science, and systems engineering teams
    as well as research teams including Waymo Research, Google Brain, and DeepMind
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous vehicle navigation and control in real-world driving conditions
  - Simulation-based training and evaluation of autonomous driving systems
  - Reinforcement learning for optimizing driving behaviors and decision-making
  - Learning from demonstration to capture expert driving patterns
  - Generative modeling for scenario synthesis and data augmentation
  - Robust evaluation of ML systems under diverse driving conditions
