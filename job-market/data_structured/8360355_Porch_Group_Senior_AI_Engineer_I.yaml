      The role involves hands-on work with Computer Vision and NLP
      techniques (BERT, ViT), evaluating and integrating
      foundation models and vision-language models, and deploying
      RAG approaches. The engineer owns the full ML lifecycle from
      research to production, directly building and deploying
      models to extract property attributes from unstructured
      data.
  responsibilities:
  - Own the full machine learning lifecycle from research to production, leveraging
    Computer Vision and NLP techniques to extract insights from unstructured data
  - Evaluate and integrate modern AI and foundation model capabilities including vision-language
    models, embeddings, and retrieval-augmented approaches into production systems
  - Partner with product, operations, and engineering to translate business problems
    into high-impact machine learning or AI opportunities
  - Design experiments to quantify the business impact of machine learning models
  - Write robust, production-grade Python code to productionalize feature engineering,
    model training, and deployment
  - Utilize MLOps stack to drive feature engineering, model training, and data analysis
  use_cases:
  - Extract property attributes from text and image data sources
  - Process unstructured home and consumer data using Computer Vision and NLP
  - Leverage vision-language models for property analysis and insights extraction
  - Apply retrieval-augmented generation for enhanced data processing
