  title: AI Platform Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role is focused on building and managing AI/ML
      infrastructure platforms rather than directly building,
      training, or fine-tuning models. The engineer creates the
      environment (Kubernetes, GPU orchestration, MLOps pipelines)
      that enables data scientists to do the actual AI work.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and manage Kubernetes clusters tailored for AI/ML workloads
  - Implement Run:ai and operators for GPU resource orchestration and workload scheduling
  - Develop Python-based automation scripts and ML pipelines; automate infrastructure
    with Terraform and Ansible
  - Create and manage Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation and collaboration
  - Integrate and optimize NVIDIA Enterprise Suite components including CUDA, NeMo,
    Triton, and TensorRT
  - Establish MLOps best practices for model lifecycle management, CI/CD, and monitoring
    using MLflow and Kubeflow
  - Collaborate with data scientists and platform engineers to ensure efficient resource
    utilization and scalability
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise AI/ML infrastructure platform enabling scalable model training and
    deployment
  - GPU-accelerated computing workloads with orchestration and scheduling
  - Hybrid cloud environments for running ML workloads
  - Collaborative ML experimentation environments for data science teams
  - Automated MLOps pipelines for model lifecycle management
