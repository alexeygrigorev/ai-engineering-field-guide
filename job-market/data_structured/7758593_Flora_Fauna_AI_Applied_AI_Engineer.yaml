      This role is hands-on building agentic systems that
      orchestrate text, image, and video models. The engineer will
      design, implement, and scale multi-modal AI workflows and
      tool-using agents, which is direct work on AI systems rather
      than supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and build agentic systems powering FLORA's intelligent canvas
  - Design and implement multi-modal creative workflows combining text, image, and
    video models
  - Build orchestration systems that handle model APIs, retries, fallbacks, and edge
    cases
  - Implement memory and retrieval systems using vector DBs and embeddings for context
    management
  - Develop evaluation frameworks with automated checks and human-in-the-loop scoring
    to ensure reliability
  - Collaborate across product, infrastructure, and design teams to create intuitive
    agentic features
  - Work full-stack across frontend, backend, and infrastructure to integrate AI into
    user-facing products
  use_cases:
  - Creative professionals orchestrate text, image, and video models on an infinite
    canvas
  - Multi-modal agentic workflows that let creatives speak ideas into existence
  - Tool-using agents with memory for seamless creative content generation
  - Reliable and trustworthy AI systems for professional creative industries including
    design and entertainment
