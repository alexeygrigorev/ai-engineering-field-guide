  - Implement AI performance metrics supporting data-driven prioritization of iterative
    improvements
  - Translate AI prototypes into production-ready code under guidance
  - Participate in agile development processes including planning, code reviews, and
    team ceremonies
  - Actively learn new tools, frameworks, and best practices for AI development
