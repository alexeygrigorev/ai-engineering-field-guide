  title: AI Research Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on building of AI systems including
      agent architectures, RAG implementation, automated prompt
      optimization, fine-tuning LLMs, and deploying multi-agent
      systems. The engineer directly builds, tests, and optimizes
      AI models and agentic systems rather than supporting
      infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and implement complex agent behaviors using multi-agent hierarchies,
    multi-trajectory inference, and RL environments
  - Build and deploy automated optimization pipelines for systematically improving
    agent performance
  - Design and implement evaluation frameworks including LLM-as-a-judge systems and
    domain-specific metrics
  - Translate research papers on RAG techniques and cognitive architectures into production-ready
    code
  - Diagnose and fix agent hallucinations through context engineering and fine-tuning
    with regression testing
  - Design communication protocols for hierarchical agent systems to enable effective
    task delegation
  use_cases:
  - Multi-agent collaboration systems where manager agents delegate tasks to specialized
    worker agents
  - Tree-of-thought reasoning and complex cognitive architectures for open-ended problem
    solving
  - RAG-enhanced agents with reliable information retrieval and reduced hallucination
  - Automated prompt optimization using frameworks like DSPy for systematic performance
    improvement
  - Rigorous evaluation systems using LLM-as-a-judge frameworks to ensure agent reliability
    and safety
