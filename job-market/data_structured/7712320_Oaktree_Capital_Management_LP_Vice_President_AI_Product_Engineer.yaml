      This is hands-on work building, deploying, and optimizing
      LLM-powered applications, RAG pipelines, and agents. The
      role involves direct model implementation with LangChain,
      OpenAI SDK, embeddings, vector databases, fine-tuning, and
      full AI lifecycle management from prototype to production.
  responsibilities:
  - Prototype LLM-powered tools, copilots, and retrieval-based workflows using APIs,
    embeddings, and orchestration frameworks
  - Build full-stack AI features with robust infrastructure, including retrieval logic,
    prompt pipelines, caching, evaluation, and observability
  - Own the full AI lifecycle from data preparation and experimentation to deployment
    and monitoring
  - Rapidly evaluate new models and frameworks to test what works and discard what
    doesn't
  - Monitor and improve system performance across accuracy, latency, hallucination,
