      This role involves building and maintaining distributed
      model management systems for AI inference workloads,
      including deploying LLM inference pipelines at scale. The
      engineer will work directly on inference-serving frameworks,
      GPU inference performance tuning, and optimizing inference
      performance for deep learning models, which is hands-on work
      with AI systems rather than just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and maintain distributed model management systems, including Rust-based
    runtime components, for large-scale AI inference workloads
  - Implement inference scheduling and deployment solutions on Kubernetes and Slurm,
    driving advances in scaling, orchestration, and resource management
  - Collaborate with infrastructure engineers and researchers to develop scalable
    APIs, services, and end-to-end inference workflows
  - Create monitoring, benchmarking, automation, and documentation processes to ensure
    low-latency, robust, and production-ready inference systems on GPU clusters
  use_cases:
  - Large-scale AI inference workloads on GPU clusters
  - LLM inference pipelines and deep learning model deployment
  - Distributed inference scheduling and orchestration across Kubernetes and Slurm
  - Low-latency production inference systems for AI applications
  - GPU-accelerated deep learning inference for NLP, image classification, and speech
