      This is a Quality Engineering role that focuses on testing
      and evaluating AI systems, not building or deploying them.
      The role designs test frameworks, evaluation metrics, and
      quality processes for Generative AI features but does not
      involve training, fine-tuning, or building models directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and execute comprehensive test plans for backend services, APIs, and microservices
    architectures
  - Develop automated testing frameworks using tools like Pytest, Playwright, and
    unittest
  - Build end-to-end test suites that validate the integration between backend systems,
    AI agents, databases, and services
  - Design and implement automated evaluation frameworks for Generative AI features
    including LLM/SLM model testing and behavioral assessment
  - Develop quality metrics and evaluation methodologies for LLM-based applications
    assessing accuracy, consistency, and reliability
  - Establish observability and monitoring requirements including structured logging,
    metrics collection, and tracing for AI agent behavior
  - Implement performance testing, load testing, and reliability testing for production
    backend services and AI inference pipelines
  - Mentor junior quality engineers and champion quality standards for both traditional
    backend systems and AI applications
  use_cases:
  - Agentic applications powered by Generative AI features
  - LLM/SLM model testing and prompt/output validation
  - Multi-turn conversations and tool orchestration in agentic workflows
  - RAG systems for enterprise integration
  - AI inference pipelines for production workloads
  - Quality assessment of non-deterministic AI systems
