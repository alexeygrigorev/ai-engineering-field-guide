    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work with AI/ML systems including
      fine-tuning LLMs, building transformer-based architectures,
      developing computer vision solutions, and deploying models
      using MLOps practices. This is a direct build/deploy role
      rather than supporting infrastructure or general software
      engineering.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the end-to-end lifecycle of AI-powered solutions encompassing computer vision,
    NLP, and predictive modeling
  - Drive development of innovative use cases including image enhancement, document
    intelligence, entity extraction, and automated data validation
  - Apply advanced deep learning techniques, transformer architectures, and foundation
    model fine-tuning to build scalable solutions
  - Build and maintain robust CI/CD pipelines for model training, deployment, and
    rigorous testing
  - Implement comprehensive automation for model monitoring, retraining workflows,
    and ensure end-to-end traceability
  - Lead research, development, and PoC efforts for domain-specific language models
    and fine-tune LLMs for unstructured data extraction
  - Provide mentorship and guidance to machine learning engineers and software developers
  - Collaborate with cross-functional stakeholders to define product vision and contribute
    to engineering roadmap
  use_cases:
  - Image enhancement and optical character recognition (OCR)
  - Document intelligence and entity extraction
  - Automated data validation
  - Deepfake detection and biometric verification
  - Text summarization, semantic search, and question-answering systems
  - Financial crime detection and regulatory compliance in fintech/regtech domains
