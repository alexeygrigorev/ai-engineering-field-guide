      This is a Staff AI Engineer role that involves hands-on
      implementation of GraphRAG systems, knowledge graphs,
      retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, and embedding
      strategies. The engineer directly builds and deploys AI
      infrastructure that enables agents to reason over
      educational content, including fine-tuning embedding models
      and optimizing retrieval systems for LLM consumption.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and implement graph-based knowledge systems using Neo4j, Neptune, or
    similar to represent educational content relationships, standards alignments,
    and curriculum coherence
  - Build GraphRAG systems combining knowledge graph traversal with vector similarity
    for contextually connected educational material retrieval
  - Design and implement sophisticated RAG pipelines including hybrid search, multi-stage
    retrieval, reranking strategies, and query understanding
  - Operationalize embedding pipelines for educational content, including selecting
    and fine-tuning embedding models and implementing chunking strategies
  - Build robust content ingestion systems processing structured and unstructured
    educational content with NLP pipelines for entity extraction and semantic parsing
  - Invent and operationalize memory compaction mechanisms and session state management
    for maintaining agent coherence across extended teaching workflows
  - Partner with Product, Research, and Educators to translate domain expertise into
    technical architecture for knowledge graphs and retrieval systems
  - Mentor engineers on knowledge graph design, RAG architecture patterns, embedding
    strategies, and retrieval optimization
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered educational agents that can reason over structured knowledge to assist
    teachers with curriculum planning and lesson design
  - Intelligent retrieval systems that surface relevant educational standards, lesson
    plans, and teaching materials based on contextual queries
  - Knowledge graph-driven curriculum navigation that helps teachers understand prerequisite
    relationships and learning progressions
  - Memory-aware AI agents that maintain coherent understanding across extended teaching
    workflows while managing token budgets
  - Educational content processing and enrichment systems that extract pedagogical
    metadata from unstructured documents
  - Semantic search over millions of educational resources enabling precise content
    discovery for diverse teaching scenarios
