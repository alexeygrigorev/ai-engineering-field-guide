      This is a hands-on build-and-ship role focused on designing
      and deploying AI systems including agent-based workflows
      using LangGraph, LLM chains for document understanding, and
      predictive models. The role directly works with models,
      prompt engineering, and LLM workflows - not just supporting
      infrastructure or data pipelines.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and deploy AI workflows that turn raw maintenance documents into structured,
    validated data
  - Build agent-based automation workflows using LangGraph for validation, transformation,
    and human-in-loop approval
  - Develop lightweight predictive models based on time-series or log patterns for
    early fault prediction
  - Implement NLP and LLM chains to extract meaning from technical documents, pilot
    logs, and work orders
  - Build AI systems with clear traceability, fallbacks, and execution paths that
    earn trust from ops teams and regulators
  - Own AI systems end-to-end as technical owner, improving speed, quality, and safety
    in production
  use_cases:
  - Document understanding and extraction from aviation maintenance PDFs and technical
    documents
  - Automated agent-based workflows for data validation, transformation, and approval
    with human oversight
  - Predictive fault detection and early risk identification from time-series log
    and usage data
  - NLP-powered summarization and checklist generation from regulatory documents and
    work orders
  - Intelligent data pipeline transforming raw maintenance records into structured,
    validated aviation data
