  - Build and maintain API integrations that connect disparate tools and systems,
    creating seamless data flows and automated workflows
  - Implement modern orchestration platforms to create sophisticated multi-step automations
    spanning multiple systems and departments
  - Measure and report on the impact of automation initiatives, tracking metrics like
    time saved, error reduction, and team productivity improvements
  - Train teams and evangelize how to use automation systems to self-serve frequent
    issues
