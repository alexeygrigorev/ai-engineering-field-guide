      The role is building user-facing applications, interfaces,
      and workflows that sit on top of AI systems, not building or
      deploying the AI/ML models themselves. The engineer works at
      the product-engineering boundary, creating interfaces for
      knowledge capture, feedback, and evaluation that enable
      humans to interact with AI systems built by others (Forward
      Deployed AI Engineers).
  responsibilities:
  - Own the design and implementation of user-facing applications that sit directly
    on top of AI systems
  - Build interfaces and workflows for knowledge capture, system configuration, evaluation,
    and feedback
  - Ensure human interactions with AI systems produce high-quality signal that measurably
    improves system behavior over time
  - Partner with AI Strategists to understand customer goals and translate them into
    executable product designs
  - Work across the full stack including front end, back end, and data to deliver
    cohesive product experiences
  - Iterate quickly in production using real user behavior and system outcomes to
    refine product experiences
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise workflow automation powered by GenAI
  - Knowledge capture and management systems
  - AI system evaluation and feedback loops
  - Human-AI collaboration interfaces
  - Domain knowledge encoding for AI systems
  - Configuration and management of AI-powered applications
