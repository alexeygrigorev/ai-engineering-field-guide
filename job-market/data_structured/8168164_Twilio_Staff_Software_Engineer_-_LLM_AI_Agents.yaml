      While the role mentions experience with agents and LLMs, the
      primary focus is building distributed systems and identity
      management infrastructure. The engineer is building platform
      capabilities and security systems that enable AI agent
      authentication, rather than building, training, or deploying
      AI models directly.

  - Build and own product capabilities for Stytch's agentic identity platform on Twilio
  - Design, implement, and maintain scalable, reliable distributed services optimizing
    for security, latency, and developer experience
  - Partner with Product and Engineering leadership to set direction, translate customer
    needs into technical plans, and deliver high-impact roadmap features
  - Collaborate across Twilio and Stytch teams to align on architecture, integrate
    platform capabilities, and unblock cross-team initiatives
  - Own the end-to-end lifecycle of new services from initial design and prototyping
    through to production deployment and operational readiness
  - Mentor other engineers on the team, fostering a culture of innovation, ownership,
    and continuous learning
  use_cases:
  - Agentic and non-human identity authentication for AI systems
  - Secure identity verification and authorization for AI developers
  - Developer-first identity platform for AI agent applications
  - Authentication and access management for emerging AI use cases
  - Identity solutions protecting AI-powered customer experiences
