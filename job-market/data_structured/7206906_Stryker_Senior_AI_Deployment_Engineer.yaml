      This is a forward deployment engineer role that directly
      deploys, optimizes, and operationalizes AI/ML models
      including GenAI features, computer vision, and multi-modal
      AI systems. The role involves hands-on work with LLMs,
      multi-agentic frameworks, and model optimization techniques
      like quantization and TensorRT for real-time inference on
      edge devices.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and deploy AI-powered software on cloud and edge devices including iPhone,
    iPad, Vision Pro, Android, and NVidia devices
  - Optimize AI/ML models and pipelines for real-time inference on edge devices to
    meet latency and performance requirements
  - Build containerized AI services using Docker and orchestrate deployments with
    Kubernetes
  - Deploy and maintain real-time microservices for AI applications including GenAI
    applications
  - Work with MLOps and AI security teams to support continuous integration, testing,
    and monitoring of AI models
  - Design deployment evaluation frameworks, develop unit tests, and perform software
    verification/validation testing in compliance with regulatory requirements
  use_cases:
  - Surgical robotics and navigation systems using computer vision and AI
  - Image-guided surgery augmented with real-time AI inference on edge devices
  - Mixed reality (XR) applications integrating computer vision and multi-modal AI
  - Clinical decision intelligence and outcome assessment for treatment selection
  - Operating room safety and efficiency monitoring through AI-powered analysis
