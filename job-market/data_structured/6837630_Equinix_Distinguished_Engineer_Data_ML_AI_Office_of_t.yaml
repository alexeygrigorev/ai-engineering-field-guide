      This is a Distinguished Engineer role focused on technology
      architecture and strategy for data lifecycle management, ML
      infrastructure, and AI platforms. The responsibilities
      emphasize data infrastructure, MLOps, data governance, and

    investments and design decisions for data lifecycle management
  - Serve as a visible technology thought leader articulating Equinix's technology
    vision, strategy and architecture
