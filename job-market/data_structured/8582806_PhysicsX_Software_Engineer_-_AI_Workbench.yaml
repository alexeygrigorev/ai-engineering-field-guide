    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building data platforms, microservices,
      APIs, and data pipelines that support the ML lifecycle, not
      building or training the AI models themselves. The engineer
      is architecting the infrastructure and data strategy that
      enables data scientists to work with Deep Physics Models,
      which makes this a supporting role rather than hands-on
      AI/ML development.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build scalable microservices, APIs, and data pipelines for high-dimensional
    simulation data across the ML lifecycle
  - Build and maintain automated data ingestion and processing pipelines that power
    active learning loops
  - Implement and integrate data infrastructure components including Data Warehouses,
    Data Lakes, and storage solutions for simulation and deep learning workloads
  - Build internal tools that enable BI dashboards and scientific data visualizations
  - Own features end-to-end from implementation through testing, deployment, and maintenance
  - Contribute to reliability standards, performance monitoring, and quality of service
    metrics
  - Participate in CI/CD pipeline maintenance, automated testing, and observability
    practices
  - Contribute to Technical Decision Records and team discussions on tooling and architectural
    trade-offs
  use_cases:
  - High-fidelity multi-physics simulation through AI inference
  - Engineering and manufacturing optimization and automation
  - Deep Physics Models for aerospace, defense, materials, energy, semiconductors,
    and automotive
  - Active learning loops for continuous model improvement
  - Scientific data visualization for complex simulation results
  - Large-scale simulation data storage and analytics
