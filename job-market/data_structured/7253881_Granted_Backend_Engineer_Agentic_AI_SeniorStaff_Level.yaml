position:
  title: Backend Engineer, Agentic AI (Senior/Staff Level)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is an AI-first role because the engineer will directly
      build agentic AI workflows, including prompt orchestration,
      agent frameworks, and model evaluation loops. The role
      involves creating and optimizing AI pipelines and automated
      agents that handle complex healthcare case flows, which is
      hands-on work with AI systems rather than just supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build scalable systems and APIs that power agentic workflows from case
    activation through resolution
  - Push the frontier of AI-driven engineering, working on prompt orchestration, agent
    frameworks, and model evaluation loops
  - Collaborate closely with Product, Engineering, and domain experts to translate
    complex healthcare processes into reliable automations
  - Architect systems for scale and reliability, ensuring human escalation pathways
    are transparent and seamless
  - Play a key role in shaping the pod's technical strategy, and mentor others as
    the team grows
  - Create and optimize AI pipelines to identify, categorize, and resolve errors in
    medical billing and insurance claims
  - Build automated agents and backend services that handle complex case flows with
    minimal human intervention
  use_cases:
  - Automating the identification, categorization, and resolution of errors in medical
    billing and insurance claims
  - Building agentic workflows that navigate complex healthcare case work with minimal
    human intervention
  - Integrating domain-specific healthcare knowledge into AI models and decision engines
    to improve accuracy
  - Developing real-world AI performance measurement and improvement tooling for healthcare
    automation
  - Fighting claim denials, correcting billing errors, and negotiating bills through
    AI-driven automation
