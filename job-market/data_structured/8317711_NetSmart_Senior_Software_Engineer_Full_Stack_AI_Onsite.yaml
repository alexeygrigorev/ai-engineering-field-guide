    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves designing, developing, and deploying
      generative AI, machine learning models, and AI systems. The
      engineer works directly with ML frameworks (TensorFlow,
      PyTorch), conducts experiments, iterates on models, and is
      responsible for model optimization and deployment.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and optimize machine learning models for production environments
  - Build scalable AI systems, including data pipelines, model training, and deployment
    frameworks
  - Work with deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) and traditional ML libraries
    (Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate AI solutions into existing
    products and services
  - Optimize models for performance, scalability, and efficiency in cloud or on-prem
    environments
  - Conduct experiments, analyze performance, and iterate on models to enhance accuracy
    and efficiency
  - Mentor junior engineers and contribute to the AI/ML technical strategy
  use_cases:
  - Transform data-driven insights into real-world applications
  - Deploy machine learning models into production systems
  - Integrate AI solutions into existing products and services
  - Implement NLP techniques using deep learning architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
  - Build and optimize data preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines
