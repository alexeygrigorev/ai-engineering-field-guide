      This is a platform engineering role focused on building data
      infrastructure, ingestion pipelines, and storage systems
      that enable AI-powered experiences at HubSpot. The role
      emphasizes distributed systems, data processing, and
      platform architecture rather than building, training, or

    processing, storage, sync, reliability, and intelligence surfaces
  - Design and evolve large-scale, fault-tolerant distributed systems processing billions
    of events per day
  - Define and drive reusable platform patterns across ingestion, processing, quality,
    sync, and observability layers
  - Ship high-impact software end-to-end as a hands-on contributor with deep technical
    engagement
  - Align platform architecture with HubSpot's CRM, AI/ML, and extensibility goals
    to enable product evolution
  - Provide technical mentorship and leadership through design reviews, incident postmortems,
    and architectural decisions
  - Partner with product and engineering leadership to define strategy and execute
    for product-line-wide outcomes
  - Elevate HubSpot's brand externally and help attract senior talent while sharing
    knowledge across the company
  use_cases:
  - Mining, curating, and reconciling facts about customers and their business processes
    to power AI experiences
  - Processing billions of events including calls, chats, emails, and unstructured
    documents to maintain up-to-date customer insights
  - Building an ecosystem of ingestion pipelines, storage layers, synchronization
    systems, and AI/ML data infrastructure
  - Providing a context layer that serves as the foundation for AI-powered features
    across HubSpot's platform
