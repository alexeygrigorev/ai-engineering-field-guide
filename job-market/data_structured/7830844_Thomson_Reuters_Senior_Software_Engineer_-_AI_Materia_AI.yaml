    reasoning: |-
      This is a Senior Software Engineer role focused on building
      backend infrastructure, APIs, and distributed systems that
      support AI workflows rather than directly building,
      training, or fine-tuning AI models. The role involves
      connecting backend services to LLM providers and
      implementing orchestration logic, but the primary work is
      backend architecture, microservices, and platform
      engineering to enable AI capabilities.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement backend services using Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL for
    AI-native products
  - Build distributed systems and APIs supporting real-time AI interactions, agents,
    and orchestration engines
  - Integrate backend services with LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropic, implementing
    orchestration logic and request routing
  - Productionize AI components with robust error handling, guardrails, and observability
  - Optimize system performance across concurrency, caching, throughput, and large-scale
    document processing
  - Lead architecture discussions, code reviews, and champion engineering best practices
    for testing and resiliency
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered tax and accounting professional assistance
  - Real-time AI interactions and agent orchestration for document processing
  - Large-scale content analysis and retrieval for tax/accounting workflows
  - High-traffic API serving for intelligent production-scale features
