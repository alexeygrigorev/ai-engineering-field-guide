  title: Senior Software Engineer - AI Products
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      Role involves architecting and scaling AI/ML systems,
      deploying cutting-edge model capabilities including LLM-
      driven workflows, and building production ML products. The
      engineer directly builds AI systems (domain-specific AI
      peer-programmer, ingestion engine) rather than just
      supporting infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and scale advanced AI and ML systems that power hx's next generation
    of products, solving problems where no off-the-shelf solution exists
  - Lead the design and deployment of cutting-edge model capabilities, from LLM-driven
    workflows to domain-specific ML pipelines optimised for messy, high-value real-world
    data
  - Drive foundational decisions across data, modelling, and production infrastructure
    to ensure performance, robustness, and long-term scalability of the AI platform
  - Rapidly prototype novel ideas, validate them in live environments, and evolve
    successful experiments into production-grade systems used by customers at scale
  - Advance hx's broader AI strategy through shaping technical direction, embedding
    best practices, and raising the bar for how we build, test, and ship ML-powered
    features
  - Act as a technical multiplier by mentoring engineers, cultivating deep ML craftsmanship,
    and fostering a culture anchored in curiosity, speed, and scientific rigor
  use_cases:
  - Domain-specific AI peer-programmer embedded in a custom IDE to help actuaries
    and underwriters code, model risk, and make billion-dollar decisions
  - Powerful ingestion engine that transforms unstructured insurance documents into
    structured insights
  - Agentic workflows that reinvent how the insurance industry operates and makes
    decisions
  - AI-powered platform for pricing and underwriting decisions in the insurance industry
