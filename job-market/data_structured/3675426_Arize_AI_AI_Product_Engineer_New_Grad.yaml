      This is an AI Product Engineer role at Arize AI, which is an
      AI observability and evaluation platform company. The role
      involves building tools and infrastructure to enable other
      AI engineers to monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize their AI
      systems - this is working NEAR AI but NOT building,
      training, or deploying models directly. The work focuses on
      developing APIs, evaluation infrastructure, databases, and
      systems that support AI development rather than creating AI
      models themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Drive AI product innovation by understanding how engineering teams develop AI
    and LLM-powered applications
  - Build clean APIs that instrument applications for observability
  - Create interactive playgrounds for prompt engineering and agent development
  - Scale real-time evaluation infrastructure to handle millions of annotations per
    second
  - Compute model evaluation metrics across billions of data points
  - Create AI Agents that help customers troubleshoot their own applications
  - Implement advanced dimensionality reduction techniques
  - Build systems on top of a custom OLAP database
  use_cases:
  - Monitoring and observing AI systems in production to ensure performance and reliability
  - Troubleshooting AI applications to identify and resolve issues
  - Evaluating model performance across billions of data points at scale
  - Enabling prompt engineering and AI agent development through interactive tools
  - Providing real-time evaluation infrastructure for AI applications
  - Helping enterprises like Booking.com, Uber, Siemens, and PepsiCo deliver reliable
    AI systems
