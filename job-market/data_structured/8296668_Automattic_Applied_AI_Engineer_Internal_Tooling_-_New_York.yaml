    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building internal tooling, maintaining
      a self-hosted AI interface (LibreChat), and creating
      integrations that help teams use AI better. While it works
      with AI tools and LLM APIs, the primary work is on the
      infrastructure/platform layer rather than building,
      training, or fine-tuning models - the role is enabling
      others to use AI rather than directly working ON AI models.
  responsibilities:
  - Own and maintain Automattic's LibreChat deployment including extensions and customization
    on a TypeScript/Node.js stack
  - Contribute upstream to the LibreChat open source project to add features for Automattic's
    needs
  - Build lightweight internal tools and automations that integrate AI capabilities
    into existing Automattic systems
  - Collaborate with DevOps on hosting infrastructure, scaling, reliability, and continuous
    improvement of services
  - Create agent skills, custom workflows, and productivity multipliers while experimenting
    with emerging AI tools
  - Document tools and run workshops to help engineers adopt AI tooling effectively
  use_cases:
  - Self-hosted AI chat interface for internal team productivity and collaboration
  - Internal AI-powered developer tools and automations to enhance workflow efficiency
  - AI capabilities integrated into existing company systems for productivity improvements
  - Custom agent skills and workflows tailored to specific organizational needs
  - Open source AI interface maintained and improved for broader community use
