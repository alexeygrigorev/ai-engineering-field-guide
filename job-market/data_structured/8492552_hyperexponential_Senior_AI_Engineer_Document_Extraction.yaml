  focus: AI-powered insurance pricing and underwriting platform
position:
  title: Senior AI Engineer (Document Extraction)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work building and deploying LLM-
      based document extraction systems, including designing
      evaluation frameworks, productionizing models, and directly
      integrating with customers. The engineer takes end-to-end
      ownership from experimentation through production rollout,
      working directly on AI systems rather than just supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and deliver high-accuracy document extraction pipelines that automate key
    data capture across specialty insurance lines
  - Build and productionise data cleansing and manipulation capabilities within the
    ingestion system to improve downstream pricing inputs
  - Define and enforce evaluation-driven development practices, creating robust evaluation
    sets and benchmarks for model improvements
  - Improve evaluation infrastructure for complex ingestion scenarios to enable faster
    iteration cycles and performance visibility
  - Partner directly with customers during go-live to diagnose integration bottlenecks
    and resolve production issues
  - Lead technical deep-dives and brainstorming sessions to unblock complex extraction
    challenges and raise experimentation standards
  use_cases:
  - Automated extraction of structured data from messy insurance-specific documents
  - Data cleansing and transformation for pricing and underwriting workflows
  - Document understanding for specialty insurance lines of business
  - Production-grade ingestion systems that enable insurers to automate workflows
    with confidence
  - Evaluation-driven AI systems for high-stakes insurance decision-making
