    reasoning: |-
      This is an "AI Enabler" role focused on multiplying
      engineering productivity through GenAI tools usage, coaching
      teams, and building internal developer-facing tools. The
      role does not involve building, training, or deploying AI
      models - instead it works near AI by integrating LLM APIs
      and enabling AI-first practices across the organization.
  responsibilities:
  - Join one of our builders' teams to build great products loved by our customers
  - 'Apply an AI-first mindset to every phase of you-build-it-you-run-it: from design
    and coding to testing, deployment and operations'
  - Work hands-on in real product codebases using GenAI tools to accelerate development,
    improve quality and simplify existing systems
  - Build and evolve AI-powered internal tools and workflows (assistants for coding,
    reviews, documentation, testing) that engineers across AutoScout24 can rely on
    every day
  - 'Act as a multiplier and culture driver: coach teams on effective GenAI usage,
    share patterns and anti-patterns, and help establish AI-first ways of working
    across our engineering organization'
  - 'Experiment, measure and improve: run small, data-informed experiments with teams,
    learn what works in our context, and turn successful approaches into repeatable
    standards and playbooks'
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered coding assistants to accelerate development and improve code quality
  - AI tools for code reviews, automated documentation generation, and testing workflows
  - Internal developer productivity tools leveraging LLMs for code generation, refactoring,
    and debugging
  - AI-first development practices integrated into the full software lifecycle
  - Scalable GenAI adoption patterns and guardrails for enterprise engineering teams
