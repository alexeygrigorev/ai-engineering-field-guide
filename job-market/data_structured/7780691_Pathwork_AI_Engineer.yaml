    design teams
  - Optimize accuracy, latency, and robustness through fine-tuning, evaluation frameworks,
    and data iteration
  - Build infrastructure and tools for debugging, observability, and agent testing
    to support company growth
  - Hire, mentor, and collaborate with engineers while taking ownership of technical
    and product strategy
