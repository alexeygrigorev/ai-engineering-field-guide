      The role involves hands-on work building and deploying AI
      systems including LLM inference, agent workflows, RAG
      pipelines, and fine-tuning LLMs in production. This goes
      beyond enabling AI work - the developer is directly
      responsible for integrating generative AI and agentic
      systems, designing RAG pipelines, and deploying models to
      production environments.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and optimize cloud-native backend services and infrastructure for
    AI applications on AWS or Azure
  - Develop infrastructure as code using Terraform, CloudFormation, or ARM templates
    to automate cloud deployments
  - Implement CI/CD pipelines for AI model deployment and automated testing
  - Build scalable APIs and microservices to serve AI features including LLM inference
    and agent workflows
  - Integrate generative AI and agentic systems using LangChain, CrewAI, and AutoGen
    into production applications
  - Design and optimize RAG pipelines with vector databases for latency and cost efficiency
  - Fine-tune LLMs using LoRA and PEFT or leverage cloud AI services for custom use
    cases
  - Collaborate cross-functionally with teams to translate business needs into scalable
    AI solutions
  use_cases:
  - LLM inference and agent workflows for production applications
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines for knowledge retrieval and context-aware
    responses
  - Agentic AI systems for automated workflow execution
  - Custom LLM fine-tuning for domain-specific applications
  - AI-powered backend services integrated with full-stack applications
  - Scalable microservices for AI feature delivery with security and cost optimization
