      This role involves hands-on work building and deploying AI
      systems including Transformer-based architectures, fine-
      tuning LLMs, implementing RAG pipelines, and building
      intelligent agents. The engineer directly develops,
      optimizes, and integrates AI solutions rather than providing
      supporting infrastructure or general software engineering.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and optimize Transformer-based architectures including GPT, LLaMA,
    Mistral, and Claude
  - Fine-tune large language models for domain-specific applications
  - Implement advanced prompt engineering strategies and RAG pipelines for enhanced
    contextual performance
  - Build intelligent agents using frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, CrewAI,
    and AutoGen
  - Apply reinforcement learning techniques including Q-learning, policy gradients,
    and RLlib
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate AI solutions into scalable
    products
  - Ensure best practices in data engineering and contribute to architectural decisions
  - Mentor junior team members and support senior team members in identifying data
    science opportunities
  use_cases:
  - Domain-specific language model applications
  - Context-aware AI systems using RAG
  - Intelligent agent-based solutions
  - Reinforcement learning-powered systems
  - Scalable AI product integration
  - Data science opportunity identification
