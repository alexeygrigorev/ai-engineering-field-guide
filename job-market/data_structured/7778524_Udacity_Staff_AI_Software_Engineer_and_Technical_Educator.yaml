      This role involves building production agents and multi-
      agent architectures, designing orchestration patterns,
      implementing tool/function calling, RAG systems, and
      evaluation frameworks. The engineer works directly on AI/ML
      systems - creating agentic applications rather than
      supporting infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design multi-agent architectures and orchestration patterns for content creation,
    review, and publishing
  - Build production agents and tools with CLIs/APIs in Python and Go to power content
    creation and interactive learning
  - Orchestrate stateful agents, event-driven pipelines, and tool/function calling
    systems
  - Implement automated evaluations, rubrics, safety guardrails, and human-in-the-loop
    review with quality metrics
  - Present on camera as course instructor, teaching complex technical concepts and
    walking through demos
  - Create learning experiences including scripts, demos, and hands-on projects that
    engage learners
  use_cases:
  - Agentic course creation using multi-agent systems to generate educational content
  - Interactive learning experiences powered by AI agents for student engagement
  - Automated content review and publishing pipelines with quality evaluation
  - RAG-based systems for content retrieval and knowledge enhancement in learning
    materials
  - Educational content generation with human-in-the-loop quality control and safety
    guardrails
