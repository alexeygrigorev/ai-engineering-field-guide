      This role involves hands-on building, deploying, and fine-
      tuning of GenAI and LLM-based systems including RAG
      architectures, prompt engineering, and LLM-powered
      applications. The engineer owns the end-to-end lifecycle
      from model deployment to monitoring, which qualifies as

  - Evaluate new AI technologies, frameworks, and vendors to inform build vs. buy
    decisions and technical direction
  - Own end-to-end lifecycle of AI solutions from data ingestion and feature development
    to model deployment, monitoring, and iteration
  - Integrate AI capabilities into existing GTM platforms and workflows such as Salesforce,
    internal tools, and analytics platforms
  - Establish best practices for AI engineering including model evaluation, observability,
    performance optimization, and reliability
  - Partner with cross-functional teams to translate business requirements into scalable
    technical designs
  - Collaborate with Data, GTM Systems, Security, and Legal teams to ensure solutions
    meet data quality, privacy, security, and compliance standards
