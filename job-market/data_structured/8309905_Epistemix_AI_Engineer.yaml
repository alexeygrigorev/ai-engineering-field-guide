position:
  title: AI Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves direct hands-on work with LLMs, prompt
      optimization, LLM evaluation, and fine-tuning AI behavior.
      The engineer is responsible for building and deploying AI-
      driven applications and AI-generated agent-based models,
      which is core AI/ML development work rather than supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Craft clean, testable, and maintainable code to enable AI-generated agent-based
    models
  - Own the software from requirements development through deployment and maintenance
    for AI systems
  - Design, build, test, and deploy scalable system architecture for AI-generated
    models
  - Own the engineering solution and collaborate with internal teams to ensure alignment
    with company strategy
  use_cases:
  - Making modeling and simulation accessible to non-data scientists through AI-driven
    applications
  - Enabling decision makers to generate agent-based models that address critical
    business questions
  - Helping data scientists build agent-based models more quickly using AI generation
  - Forecasting outcomes and managing risk through behavior modeling
  - Scenario planning through advanced data science and simulation for healthcare,
    insurance, and government sectors
