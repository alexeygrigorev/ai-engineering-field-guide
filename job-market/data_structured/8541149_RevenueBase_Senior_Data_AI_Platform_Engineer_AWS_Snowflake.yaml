position:
  title: Senior Data & AI Platform Engineer (AWS, Snowflake, Vector Search)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on implementation of vector
      embeddings, LLM API integration, semantic search systems,
      and RAG workflows. The engineer builds, deploys, and
      optimizes production AI systems including embedding
      generation pipelines and similarity-based retrieval - direct
      work on AI/ML systems rather than just supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build data-driven tools operating on large datasets stored in S3 and
    Snowflake
  - Implement embedding generation pipelines using LLM APIs like OpenAI and store
    in vector databases like Pinecone
  - Develop enrichment workflows using LLM APIs to generate derived columns and write
    results back to Snowflake
  - Build reusable internal services and SDKs for embedding generation, prompt orchestration,
    and data augmentation
  - Optimize performance and cost across AWS infrastructure for AI-powered systems
  - Ensure reliability, observability, and maintainability of AI-powered pipelines
    and services
  use_cases:
  - Semantic search and similarity-based retrieval on B2B data
  - AI-powered data enrichment using LLMs to generate new insights from structured
    data
  - Enterprise data platform enabling autonomous AI agents to access trustworthy B2B
    data
  - Internal tools and frameworks for LLM-based data transformation and validation
  - Query abstraction layer making AI-enhanced analytics accessible to non-engineering
