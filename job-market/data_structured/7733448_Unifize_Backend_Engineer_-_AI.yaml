    the larger Unifize system
  - Contribute to design decisions, including service boundaries, API structure, and

  - Quality management system integration with AI capabilities
  - CAPA management and deviation resolution
  - Product launch processes with AI assistance
  - Audit preparation and compliance management with traceability
