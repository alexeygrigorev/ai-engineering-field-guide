      This role involves hands-on building, designing, and
      deploying agentic AI systems using LangGraph, AutoGen,
      CrewAI, and other agent frameworks. The engineer directly
      works on multi-agent architectures, RAG patterns, tool
      calling, and LLM system productionization—not just
      supporting infrastructure for AI work.
  responsibilities:
  - Design multi-agent architectures with robust state management, memory, and routing
  - Implement leading agentic frameworks and build modular reusable components
  - Integrate enterprise tools and data sources via function calling and event-driven
    flows
  - Implement RAG patterns with vector stores and structured knowledge sources
  - Define SLIs/SLOs, implement tracing/metrics, and create evaluation harnesses
  - Enforce safety and governance policies with role/tenant isolation and data minimization
  - Collaborate with enterprise clients to translate business processes into agentic
    designs
  use_cases:
  - RFP assistance through automated agent workflows
  - Incident Root Cause Analysis (RCA) drafting using agentic systems
  - Knowledge operations automation for enterprise workflows
  - Secure enterprise tool integration and data orchestration
  - Business process automation with multi-agent systems
  - Retrieval-augmented generation for enterprise knowledge bases
