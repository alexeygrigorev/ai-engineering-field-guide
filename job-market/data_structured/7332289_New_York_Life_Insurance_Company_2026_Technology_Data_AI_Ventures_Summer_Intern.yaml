    scale
  use_cases:
  - Risk classification and predictive modeling for insurance applications
  - Generative AI Q&A tools for agents and financial advisors to streamline workflows
  - Model deployment patterns and infrastructure for production AI systems
  - Monitoring and reliability frameworks for deployed machine learning models
  - Evaluation frameworks for assessing Generative AI tool performance
