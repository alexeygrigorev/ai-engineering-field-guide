      This is an AI-first role focused on building AI-driven
      capabilities including agents, intelligent assistants, and
      generative AI features. The role requires hands-on work with
      LLMs, prompt engineering, LLMOps, and deploying AI solutions
      to production for customer-facing products.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and ship AI-driven capabilities including agents, intelligent
    assistants, context-aware prediction, and generative AI
  - Engineer high-performing AI workflows leveraging LLMs, prompt engineering, and
    generative techniques for reliability and scalability
  - Execute end-to-end AI projects from conceptualization and prototyping to production
    code
  - Experiment and iterate on AI capabilities while staying ahead of emerging AI tools,
    frameworks, and techniques
  - Champion best practices in AI system development including evaluations, LLMOps,
    CI/CD, observability, and ethical AI
  - Measure and optimize AI performance, establishing benchmarks for user engagement,
    model accuracy, latency, error rate, and drift
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered intelligent assistants that help users create and transform content
    on the canvas
  - Context-aware prediction features that anticipate user needs
  - Generative AI capabilities that enhance content creation and collaboration
  - AI-driven workflows that transform how users interact with complex information
    on the canvas
