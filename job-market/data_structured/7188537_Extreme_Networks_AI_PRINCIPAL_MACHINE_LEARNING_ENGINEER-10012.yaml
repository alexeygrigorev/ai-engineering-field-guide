      This role involves hands-on building and deploying
      Generative AI solutions including RAG, AI Agents, and LLM
      fine-tuning at scale. The responsibilities explicitly
      include architecting production-grade ML platforms and
      frameworks for next-generation real-time ML and Generative
      AI systems, directly working on AI/ML systems rather than
      supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Serve as a thought leader and forward thinker, setting the technical vision and
    driving innovation across products and platforms
  - Own and guide the full software development lifecycle at scale, including architecture,
    design, testing, deployment, and operations
  - Architect and deliver high-performance, production-grade ML platforms and frameworks,
    enabling next-generation real-time ML and Generative AI systems
  - Partner with senior engineers, scientists, and cross-functional leaders to accelerate
    experimentation, validation, and model integration
  - Shape long-term strategy by designing and launching strategic ML solutions that
    deliver company-wide impact
  - Lead technical discussions, define best practices, and ensure engineering rigor
    through design and code reviews
  use_cases:
  - AI-driven network management and monitoring
  - Real-time anomaly detection for network operations
  - Intelligent multi-agent systems that perceive, learn, and act on network data
    in real time
  - Knowledge base management and retrieval for network troubleshooting
  - Generative AI-powered network assistance and automation
