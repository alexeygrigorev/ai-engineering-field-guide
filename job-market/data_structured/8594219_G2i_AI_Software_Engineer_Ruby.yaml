      This role directly works ON AI/ML systems through RLHF
      (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) for large
      language models. The engineer ranks, edits, and provides
      feedback to tune LLM behavior for code generation, which is
      hands-on model training work, not just support
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Compare and rank multiple code snippets, explaining which is best and why
  - Repair and refactor AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and style
  - Inject feedback including ratings, edits, and test results into the RLHF pipeline
  - Maintain smooth operation of the RLHF feedback pipeline
  - Generate reward signals from expert feedback to guide model training
  - Help LLMs learn to propose, critique, and improve code like production engineers
  use_cases:
  - Training large language models to write production-grade code across multiple
    programming languages
  - Improving AI-generated code through human feedback and reinforcement learning
  - Automated code evaluation and ranking using expert engineering judgment
  - Converting human code review feedback into RL reward signals
  - Developing AI models that can self-critique and improve generated code
