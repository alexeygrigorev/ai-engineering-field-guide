    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves designing and deploying AI agents that
      power PermitFlow's platform, with direct ownership of the
      full lifecycle from model development to orchestration and
      productionization. The engineer builds multi-step AI/ML
      systems, optimizes inference pipelines, and implements
      agentic workflows to automate permitting processes end-to-
      end.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and deploy AI agents that automate permitting workflows end-to-end
  - Orchestrate multiple models and tools to create reliable, multi-step AI systems
  - Build internal tools and infrastructure that power and monitor these agents
  - Design and implement backend and frontend services, APIs, and data pipelines with
    integrated AI functionality
  - Contribute to system architecture and core platform design
  - Design and maintain evaluations and benchmarks to measure agent accuracy, reliability,
    and cost-effectiveness
  - Optimize inference pipelines and backend systems for speed, scalability, and cost
  use_cases:
  - Automating construction permitting workflows from application to approval
  - Navigating licensing and inspections for construction companies
  - Accelerating housing, clean-energy, and infrastructure development
  - Reducing compliance time and de-risking construction projects
  - Understanding what can be built, where, and how for regulatory compliance
