      This role is directly building a multi-agent AI system that
      orchestrates foundational models to perform complex legal
      work. The hands-on work includes architecting agent
      frameworks, implementing RAG systems, building validation
      loops, and deploying production agentic AI applications.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and build the agentic harness - a production-grade software system that
    orchestrates foundational models to perform complex, real-world work
  - Design the core framework for coordinating multiple specialized agents on long-running
    tasks, including building robust API tool libraries and implementing sophisticated
    error recovery
  - Architect high-fidelity memory systems with advanced RAG capabilities for reasoning
    over thousands of pages of unstructured, domain-specific documents
  - Build reliability and validation frameworks including multi-agent validation loops,
    confidence scoring, and human-in-the-loop escalation paths
  - Develop specialized AI agents for medical record intelligence, demand package
    generation, and other legal workflows
  - Ensure compliance with regulated industry requirements including HIPAA and SOC
    2 standards
  use_cases:
  - 'Medical record intelligence: ingesting unstructured medical records, building
    structured timelines, and performing causation analysis to distinguish pre-existing
    conditions from accident-related injuries'
  - 'Demand package generation: coordinating researcher, drafter, and validator agents
    to gather case law, write persuasive legal arguments, and ensure citation accuracy'
  - Personal injury pre-litigation back office automation
  - High-fidelity retrieval and reasoning over legal and medical documents
  - Multi-agent validation for high-stakes legal decisions requiring 99.9%+ accuracy
