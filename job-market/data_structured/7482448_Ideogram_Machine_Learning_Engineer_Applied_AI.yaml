    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves directly working on generative media
      models, fine-tuning and deploying them for production, and
      building ML systems. The engineer will handle text-to-image,
      image-to-text, and multimodal models, which is hands-on
      AI/ML model work, not just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Bridge research and product by turning frontier generative models into production
    features across app and API
  - Fine-tune and deploy models for creative use cases including text-to-image, image-to-text,
    image enhancement and editing
  - Build rigorous evaluations, datasets, and benchmarks while running error analyses
    and debugging numerical stability
  - Partner with research, engineering, infra, and product teams to ship reliable
    and scalable ML systems
  - Lead 0 to 1 projects that shape Applied AI practices and establish success metrics
    for quality, latency, and cost
  - Contribute to safety, monitoring, and reliability of ML systems while delivering
    features that create value for users
  use_cases:
  - Text-to-image generation for graphic design and creative workflows
  - Image-to-text and multimodal model applications for design assistance
  - Image enhancement and editing tools powered by generative models
  - AI-native creative workflows that multiply human creativity
  - First-party app and API products delivering generative media capabilities
  - Design tools that help creatives with ideogram, canvas, and character creation
