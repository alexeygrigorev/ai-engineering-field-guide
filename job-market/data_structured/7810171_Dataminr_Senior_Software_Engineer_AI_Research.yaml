    Real-time event detection and AI-powered intelligence
    platform for early risk and threat discovery
position:
  title: Senior Software Engineer, AI Research
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work with LLMs including
      training, building, adapting, optimizing, and deploying
      models in production. The engineer works directly on Agentic
      AI applications and implements state-of-the-art methods in
      Generative AI, going beyond infrastructure or support to
      actively develop and deploy AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Train, build, adapt, optimize, and deploy state-of-the-art LLMs in Predictive
    AI, Generative AI, and Agentic AI applications
  - Deploy Agents and LLMs that improve performance across multimodal data (text,
    images, videos, audio, sensor data) at very large scale
  - Own the technical design and implementation of robust API services, libraries,
    and container strategies that define and support the end-to-end LLMOps lifecycle
  - Optimize DL/LLM training and inference performance for speed and cost on specialized
    hardware
  - Drive the full lifecycle of complex AI problems from research and literature review
    to data exploration, implementation of novel in-house methods, and productization
  use_cases:
  - ReGenAI automatically regenerates real-time Live Event Briefs as events unfold
  - Intel Agents autonomously generate critical context for clients on real-time events,
    threats, and risks
  - Multimodal event detection from images, video, sensor data, audio, and text in
    over 150 languages
  - Early signal detection of emerging risks, events, and threats before they unfold
    for organizations
  - Real-time analysis of billions of public data inputs spanning multiple modalities
