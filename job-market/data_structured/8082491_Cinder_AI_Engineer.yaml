      Role involves hands-on work with LLMs including data
      preparation, fine-tuning, evaluation, and production
      deployment at scale. Direct implementation of RAG
      architectures, embedding models, and agent frameworks for
      production systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Own the complete lifecycle of large language model implementation from data preparation
    and fine-tuning through rigorous evaluation and production deployment
  - Develop automated evaluation frameworks that continuously assess model accuracy,
    identify edge cases, and quantify improvements across iterations
  - Work directly with product managers and engineers to integrate AI as a core product
    capability
  - Shape AI roadmap by staying current with industry developments, evaluating emerging
    techniques, and making pragmatic adoption decisions
  - Design and implement low-latency, high-throughput, cloud-based AI/ML systems capable
    of handling thousands of requests per second
  - Build foundational infrastructure including model serving, monitoring, deployment
    pipelines, and automated testing frameworks that enables rapid experimentation
    while maintaining production reliability
  use_cases:
  - Real-time content integrity and safety detection to prevent online abuse
  - AI-powered moderation of user interactions at the product frontend
  - Protecting online platforms from harmful content and malicious behavior
  - Integration with major AI companies like OpenAI, Midjourney, and ElevenLabs for
    content safety
  - Enterprise-grade trust and safety solutions for high-volume digital products
