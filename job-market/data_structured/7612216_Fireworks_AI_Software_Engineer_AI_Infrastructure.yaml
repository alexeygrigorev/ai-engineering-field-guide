      This is an AI Infrastructure role focused on building
      backend systems, CI/CD pipelines, control planes, and model
      serving infrastructure that powers the AI platform. The
      engineer supports distributed training and inference through
      infrastructure development but does not directly build,
      train, fine-tune, or deploy AI models themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Contribute to the design and development of scalable backend infrastructure that
    supports distributed training, inference, and data pipelines
  - Build and maintain core backend services such as LLM CI/CD pipeline, control plane,
    and model serving systems
  - Support performance optimization, cost efficiency, and reliability improvements
    across compute, storage, and networking layers
  - Building frameworks and safeguards to ensure Fireworks AI has the best model quality
    in the industry
  - Collaborate with performance, training, and product teams to translate research
    and product needs into infrastructure solutions
  - Participate in code reviews, technical discussions, and continuous integration
    and deployment processes
  use_cases:
  - High-speed LLM inference platform delivering the fastest and most scalable inference
    in the industry
  - Function calling capabilities for generative AI applications
  - Multimodal model serving across vision and language modalities
  - Distributed training infrastructure for large-scale model development
  - Enterprise-grade generative AI platform with reliability and quality safeguards
