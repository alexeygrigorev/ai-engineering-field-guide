    reasoning: |-
      The role is titled "AI Model Serving" and focuses on
      infrastructure, scaling, and deploying models rather than
      building, training, or fine-tuning them. While preferred
      experience includes deploying NLP/TTS models, the core
      responsibilities are backend development, Kubernetes
      orchestration, and ensuring high availability for AI systems
      - which is supporting AI work rather than working directly
      on AI models.
  responsibilities:
  - Deploy and optimize text-to-speech models with low latency and cost efficiency
  - Build state-of-the-art voice cloning infrastructure and systems
  - Ensure infrastructure scales efficiently for AI model serving workloads
  - Construct resilient end-to-end backend systems for AI product flows
  - Deploy high availability applications on Kubernetes for production workloads
  - Optimize cloud infrastructure on GCP with knowledge of AWS and Azure
  use_cases:
  - Text-to-speech conversion for PDFs, books, docs, and web content
  - Voice cloning to create personalized audio experiences
  - Low-latency audio generation for real-time reading assistance
  - Accessibility support for users with dyslexia, ADD, and learning differences
  - Multi-platform audio delivery across iOS, Android, web, and desktop applications
