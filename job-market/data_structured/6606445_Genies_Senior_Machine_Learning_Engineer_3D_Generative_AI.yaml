  title: 'Senior Machine Learning Engineer: 3D Generative AI'
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is hands-on building, training, fine-tuning, and
      deploying generative AI models for 3D asset creation. The
      engineer will directly work with ML/DL frameworks (PyTorch,
      TensorFlow), train large-scale models, and implement white
      paper concepts for user-facing creative technologies.
  responsibilities:
  - Collaborate with R&D and Application teams to integrate AI/ML solutions into avatar
    creation ecosystem using 3D computer vision and computer graphics
  - Design, train, fine-tune, optimize, and deploy ML models and technical frameworks
    for production
  - Apply computer graphics pipelines and computational geometry to synthesize 3D
    meshes, images, and motion
  - Implement white paper concepts to develop user-facing creative technologies
  - Manage ML framework resources including dataset management, cloud computing, experiment
    tracking, and model deployment
  - Partner with Product and Creative teams to refine AI/ML-powered creation tools
    and interfaces
  use_cases:
  - Generate high-quality 3D assets for avatar creation including meshes, images,
    and motion
  - AI-generated fashion items and props for digital avatars
  - Neural radiance fields (NeRF) and Gaussian splatting for novel view synthesis
    and scene representation
  - 3D multimodal training for computer vision and graphics applications
  - Game-ready AI companions with customizable appearance and behavior
  - Volumetric differentiable rendering for animation and gaming content
