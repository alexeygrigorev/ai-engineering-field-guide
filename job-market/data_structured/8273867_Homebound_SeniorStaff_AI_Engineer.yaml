      This role involves hands-on work building and deploying LLM-
      powered applications, with direct experience requirements in
      prompt engineering, RAG, eval frameworks, and agentic
      workflows. The engineer will design scalable AI systems for
      production and shape the vision for how LLMs integrate into
      products, which is core AI development work rather than
      supporting infrastructure.

    and evolve with the business
  - Deliver high-quality, production-grade code daily while ensuring observability,
    maintainability, and reliability
  - Raise the bar across engineering by teaching AI best practices, reviewing designs,
    and guiding engineers through complex technical challenges
  - Stay abreast of the rapidly evolving AI landscape, bringing forward cutting-edge
    ideas while focusing investment where it creates clear business impact
  use_cases:
  - Developing LLM-powered applications to improve efficiency and quality across the
    homebuilding process
  - Building AI systems that capture and utilize granular data at every stage of homebuilding
  - Creating vertical AI solutions for residential construction industry workflows
  - Implementing AI-driven tools for homeowners to select, personalize, and purchase
    homes online
