      The role is hands-on building AI systems - specifically
      designing and implementing an Auto-Moderation Service using
      LLMs, RAG, and autonomous agent architectures. The engineer
      will work directly with models, embeddings, agent frameworks
      (CrewAI, LangGraph), and LLMOps tools to deploy intelligent
      agents into the platform's core architecture.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement the Auto-Moderation Service to scale safely from dozens to
    thousands of creators
  - Build and deploy intelligent agents and automated decision-making into the platform's
    core architecture
  - Apply NLP, LLMs, embeddings, and RAG to solve practical business problems around
    content moderation
  - Implement LLMOps and EVALs frameworks for rigorous model selection, quality assurance,
    and performance monitoring
  - Design autonomous agent architectures with memory, safety guardrails, and task
    performance
  - Create process automation solutions using workflow tools (Temporal.io, n8n) and
    custom scripting
  - Integrate AI services with modern web architectures including REST/GraphQL APIs
    and microservices
  use_cases:
  - Automated content moderation at scale for creator platform
  - Brand safety enforcement through AI-driven content review
  - Creator workflow automation and optimization using LLMs
  - Self-directing autonomous agent systems for content management
  - Intelligent decision-making embedded in platform architecture
