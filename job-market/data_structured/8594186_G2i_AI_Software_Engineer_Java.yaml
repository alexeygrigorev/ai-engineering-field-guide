      This role focuses on RLHF data annotation and code
      evaluation for training LLMs, rather than building or
      deploying AI models. The work involves ranking, refactoring,
      and providing feedback on AI-generated code to feed into the
      training pipeline, which is human-in-the-loop data
      preparation for AI development rather than direct AI system
      engineering.
  responsibilities:
  - Compare and rank multiple code snippets to determine the best approach
  - Repair and refactor AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and style
  - Provide detailed feedback including ratings, edits, and test results for the RLHF
    pipeline
  - Maintain the RLHF feedback pipeline and ensure smooth operation
  use_cases:
  - Training large language models to write production-grade code
  - Improving LLM code generation through human feedback and reinforcement learning
  - Developing models that can propose, critique, and improve code automatically
