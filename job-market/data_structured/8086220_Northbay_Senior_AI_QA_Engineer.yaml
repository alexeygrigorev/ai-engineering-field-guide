      This is a QA/Quality Assurance role focused on testing and
      validating AI/ML systems rather than building, training, or
      deploying them. The role involves testing data pipelines,
      validating model outputs, and ensuring quality of AI systems
      through automation frameworks, which is support work for AI
      engineers building the models.
  responsibilities:
  - Define and execute test planning, test strategy, and test cases for AI/ML and
    data-driven applications
  - Develop and maintain automated test frameworks using Selenium and Pytest
  - Perform API testing for RESTful services and validate data pipelines, ETL workflows,
    and ML model outputs
  - Conduct end-to-end testing across AI/ML lifecycle including data ingestion, training,
    inference, and deployment
  - Integrate automated test suites into CI/CD pipelines and perform regression, integration,
    system, and performance testing
  - Collaborate with Data Engineers, ML Engineers, and DevOps teams to ensure high-quality,
    scalable AI solutions
  use_cases:
  - AI/ML pipeline validation across data ingestion, training, inference, and deployment
    stages
  - Data pipeline and ETL workflow quality assurance
  - ML model output validation including accuracy, drift, and bias testing
  - API testing for AI/ML RESTful services
  - End-to-end testing of data-driven and AI-powered applications
