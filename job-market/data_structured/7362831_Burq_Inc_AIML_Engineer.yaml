      This is an ML-first role focused on designing, training,
      deploying, and optimizing machine learning models using
      TensorFlow and AWS SageMaker. The role involves hands-on
      model engineering work with MLOps practices, not just
      support infrastructure or LLM-specific development.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, train, and deploy machine learning models using AWS-native tools including
    SageMaker, Lambda, Step Functions, and S3
  - Collaborate with data engineers to build and maintain robust data pipelines for
    feature ingestion, ETL, and model training
  - Fine-tune and optimize models for scalability, accuracy, and production readiness
  - Implement MLOps best practices including CI/CD pipelines, model versioning, monitoring,
    and automated retraining workflows
  - Monitor model performance, detect drift, and implement automated alerts and corrective
    actions
  - Work with cross-functional teams to integrate AI capabilities into user-facing
    features
  use_cases:
  - AI/ML-powered automation for logistics and delivery operations
  - Turnkey delivery solution with intelligent features
  - Logistics optimization through machine learning models
  - Production ML systems for delivery platform scale
