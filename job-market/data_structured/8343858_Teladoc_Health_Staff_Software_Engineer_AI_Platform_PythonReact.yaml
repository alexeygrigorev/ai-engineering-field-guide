  title: Staff Software Engineer, AI Platform (Python/React)

    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a platform engineering role focused on building
      APIs, services, and infrastructure using Python/FastAPI and
      React. While the bonus qualifications mention exposure to
      AI/ML APIs and data pipelines, the core responsibilities
      involve building platform infrastructure and general
      software engineering - not directly building, training, or
      deploying models. The role supports AI/ML applications
      rather than working on the AI systems themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead technical design for platform features and services, breaking ambiguous requirements
    into clear, incremental designs and stories for your team and adjacent partners
  - Implement backend services in Python/FastAPI and React frontends end-to-end, owning
    a continuous stream of stories from idea to production
  - Define and use clear API contracts and data flows between services and UIs, creating
    patterns and templates others can follow
  - Champion high-quality engineering practices, including code reviews, documentation,
    and maintainable, testable designs
  - Develop and improve automated testing (unit, integration, end-to-end) and integrate
    these into everyday development and CI
  - Own the operational lifecycle of the features and services you build, including
    monitoring, observability, on-call participation, and incident follow-up
  use_cases:
  - Building platform infrastructure and APIs to support virtual healthcare applications
  - Creating developer platform capabilities that serve multiple product teams at
    Teladoc Health
  - Enabling integration with AI/ML systems and data-intensive applications through
    platform services
  - Supporting secure, scalable web services for virtual care delivery systems
  - Providing observability and operational support for healthcare platform services
