      The role involves building and deploying multi-agent AI
      ecosystems, LLMs, and agentic AI systems directly.
      Responsibilities include architecting AI agents, designing
      ML models for revenue optimization, and developing real-time
      inference systems, which is hands-on AI/ML work rather than
      supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect complex multi-agent AI ecosystems with advanced orchestration and intelligent
    workflow automation
  - Lead development of AI agents for revenue optimization, predictive analytics,
    and real-time decision-making systems
  - Design state-of-the-art ML models for audience segmentation, yield optimization,
    and predictive targeting using first-party data
  - Build advanced NLP and conversational AI systems for automated sales intelligence
    and customer insights
  - Develop real-time ML inference systems handling millions of requests per second
    with low-latency requirements
  - Provide technical guidance and mentorship to junior AI engineers and cross-functional
    team members
  - Integrate AI systems with existing infrastructure including BigQuery, ad serving
    platforms, and real-time data pipelines
