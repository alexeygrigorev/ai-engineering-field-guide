    AI capabilities to business teams
  - Translate model outputs into business workflows, integrating with existing platforms
    and use cases
  - Collaborate with data engineers and data scientists to transition solutions from
    analytical environments into production
  - Develop Python and SQL logic to support automation, orchestration, and system
    integration where low-code tools are insufficient
  - Conduct application performance testing and troubleshooting efforts to enhance
    reliability and ensure compliance standards
  use_cases:
  - Generative AI (LLM-based) applications for business workflows
  - Agentic AI solutions deployed through user interfaces
  - NLP-driven capabilities integrated into operational processes
  - AI model outputs translated into actionable business workflows
  - Healthcare industry applications using AI technologies
  - Rapid prototyping and deployment of AI-powered business applications
