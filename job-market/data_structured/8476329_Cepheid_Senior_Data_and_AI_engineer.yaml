    reasoning: |-
      The role is focused on building data pipelines, data lakes,
      and data platforms that support AI/ML workloads. The primary
      responsibilities involve data engineering tasks (pipeline
      development, data architecture, data lakes) to enable data
      scientists and ML teams, rather than directly building,
      training, or deploying AI models themselves. While the role
      supports agentic AI applications, the hands-on work is on
      the data infrastructure side, not the model development
      side.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and maintain robust, scalable, and efficient data pipelines to
    ingest, transform, and serve data for AI/ML and analytics workloads
  - Architect and maintain scalable, secure, and low-latency data pipelines and systems
    to support agentic AI applications
  - Collaborate with data scientists and engineering teams to translate business requirements
    into technical data solutions
  - Develop and manage data architecture, data lakes, and data warehouses supporting
    Service AI use cases
  - Optimize data storage, compute, and retrieval strategies for structured and unstructured
    data including logs, text, images, and telemetry
  - Support MLOps workflows by enabling model deployment, monitoring, and versioning
    pipelines
  use_cases:
  - Ticket analytics for service operations
  - Customer interaction insights and analysis
  - Predictive maintenance for equipment
  - Resource planning optimization
  - Equipment failure prediction
  - Service AI applications for technical support
