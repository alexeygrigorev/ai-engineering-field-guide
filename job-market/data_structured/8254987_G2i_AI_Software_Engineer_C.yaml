  focus: LLM code evaluation and training
position:
  title: AI Software Engineer (C++)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves providing human feedback (ranking,
      editing, critiquing code) for LLM training pipelines, not
      building, deploying, or fine-tuning models. While it's
      directly contributing to AI development, it's providing the
      feedback signal rather than implementing the AI/ML systems
      themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Compare and rank multiple code snippets, explaining which is best and why
  - Repair and refactor AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and style
  - Inject feedback including ratings, edits, and test results into the RLHF pipeline
  - Maintain smooth operation of the RLHF feedback loop
  use_cases:
  - Training large language models to write production-grade code across multiple
    programming languages
  - Using human expert feedback to generate reward signals for reinforcement learning
  - Improving AI code generation through expert ranking, editing, and justification
