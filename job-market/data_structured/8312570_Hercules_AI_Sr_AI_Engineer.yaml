    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work building, training, fine-
      tuning, and deploying LLMs/agents through post-training,
      distillation, and reinforcement learning. The engineer
      directly shapes models served in products and owns the
      entire process from data training to production
      implementation.
  responsibilities:
  - Create training environments for synthetic data generation and high-quality reward
    signals for off- and on-policy learning
  - Design and train agentic models that autonomously interact with complex structured
    and unstructured environments and navigate multimodal inputs
  - Utilize SFT, distillation, RL, or combinations to optimize model behaviors for
    interpretability and cost efficiency
  - Own benchmarking pipelines by assembling high-quality datasets and measuring impact
    of different training parameters and methodologies
  - Architect scalable inference strategies to maximize compute efficiency and maintain
    stable, reliable production solutions
  - Collaborate with engineering team to design AI-product intersections including
    interfaces, inference tracking, checkpointing, data persistence, and caching
  use_cases:
  - Automate validation and verification of data across millions of high-volume, rules-based
    transactions in finance and operations
  - Improve billing accuracy, reduce costs, and accelerate cash flow for enterprises
    through automated data processing
  - Deploy industry-specific solutions for staffing, insurance, government, and financial
    services sectors
  - Build agentic models that autonomously navigate complex environments, write and
    prototype code, and process multimodal inputs
