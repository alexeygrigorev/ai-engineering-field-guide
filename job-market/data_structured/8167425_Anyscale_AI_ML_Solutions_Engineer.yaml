    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a Solutions Engineer role focused on implementing
      Ray/Anyscale platform infrastructure for customers. While
      the work involves AI/ML workloads, the role is primarily
      about enabling distributed computing infrastructure, MLOps
      pipelines, and platform integration rather than directly
      building, training, or fine-tuning models. The engineer
      implements and scales workloads ON Anyscale's infrastructure
      but doesn't work directly ON the AI models themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Implement production AI/ML workloads using Ray and Anyscale including distributed
    training, scalable inference, and data preprocessing
  - Work hands-on with customer codebases to refactor existing workloads for distributed
    execution on Ray
  - Advise customers on ML system architecture, resource management, scaling strategies,
    and performance tuning
  - Partner with customer MLE and MLOps teams to integrate Ray into existing platforms
    and workflows with CI/CD and monitoring support
  - Enable customer teams through working sessions, design reviews, training delivery,
    and hands-on guidance
  - Contribute field feedback to product and engineering teams and develop reference
    architectures and best practices
  use_cases:
  - Distributed model training across multi-node and multi-GPU environments
  - Scalable model inference and serving for production ML workloads
  - Data preprocessing and feature pipelines at scale
  - ML workflow orchestration and operational best practices
  - MLOps platform integration including CI/CD, monitoring, and retraining pipelines
