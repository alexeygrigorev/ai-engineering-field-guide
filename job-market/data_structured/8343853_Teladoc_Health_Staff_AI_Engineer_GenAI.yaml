position:
  title: Staff AI Engineer, GenAI
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work building, deploying, and
      operationalizing GenAI/LLM systems including RAG, vector
      search, agentic AI, and model serving. The engineer will
      work directly on model integration, prompt engineering, and
      production-grade LLM pipelines rather than just supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Operationalize GenAI and LLM applications, leveraging RAG, vector search, prompt
    engineering, agentic AI, and Model Context Protocol
  - Lead the design, development, and deployment of production-grade LLM and ML pipelines,
    including data transformation, feature engineering, training, tuning, and serving
  - Architect scalable data and AI workflows on Snowflake, Databricks, and Azure ML,
    integrating AI models with modern data lakehouse platforms
  - Build and maintain API-based AI services using FastAPI and Flask, enabling secure,
    performant, and reliable model access at scale
  - Define and implement CI/CD pipelines for GenAI and ML services using GitHub Actions,
    Azure DevOps, MLFlow, and container orchestration
  - Develop and enforce MLOps/LLMOps best practices including experiment tracking,
    model versioning, observability, and governance
  - Partner with cross-functional teams to integrate AI services into products, ensuring
    security, compliance, and resilience in regulated healthcare environments
  - Troubleshoot production AI systems, analyzing inference latency, drift, and performance
    issues, and implementing preventive solutions
  use_cases:
  - Virtual care and telehealth applications enhanced with generative AI capabilities
  - Healthcare data analysis and insights through large-scale data processing on Snowflake
    and Databricks
  - AI-powered clinical decision support and information retrieval using RAG and vector
    search
  - Secure and compliant AI services deployed in regulated healthcare environments
  - Agentic AI systems for automating healthcare workflows and improving patient care
