      The role involves hands-on work building LLM-based
      applications, developing prompts and chains, working with
      RAG pipelines, and fine-tuning LLMs. This is directly
      working ON AI systems rather than just supporting
      infrastructure or data pipelines.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build AI-powered applications to analyze, summarize, and generate insights
    from survey data
  - Contribute to technical design and architecture decisions for AI/ML systems
  - Develop and optimize prompts and chains
  - Build applications to simplify analytics and improve the efficiency of data processing
  - Contribute to model evaluation and performance tracking using both qualitative
    and quantitative metrics
  - Work with structured and unstructured data and handle complex data problems
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams including data analysts, product managers,
    UI designers, and software developers
  - Stay up to date with recent developments in AI and machine learning including
    LLMs, fine tuning, and RAG pipelines
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered analysis and summarization of survey data to generate market research
    insights
  - Natural language processing applications for topic modeling, text classification,
    and summarization of opinion data
  - Building tools to handle complex data problems including missing data, fraud detection,
    and measurement error in surveys
  - Processing massive datasets from surveys, voter databases, census microdata, and
    behavioral tracking sources
  - Generating insights from diverse opinion data to support local, national, and
    international communities
