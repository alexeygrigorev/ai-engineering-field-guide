    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work with LLMs including fine-
      tuning, optimizing, and deploying large language models. The
      engineer will work directly on AI/ML systems building LLM
      evaluation frameworks, model deployment pipelines, and
      inference infrastructure, not just supporting other teams.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop, fine-tune, and optimize large language models for domain-specific health
    applications using proprietary and open-source models
  - Design and maintain automated pipelines for model training, fine-tuning, evaluation,
    and deployment across diverse AI workloads
  - Build and enhance LLM evaluation frameworks (AI Judges) for measuring model safety,
    medical accuracy, and performance
  - Implement CI/CD practices for ML/AI engineering workflows including experiment
    tracking, model versioning, and automated testing
  - Orchestrate deployment of models, AI agents, and inference endpoints with automated
    testing and rollback capabilities
  - Implement comprehensive monitoring for model performance, drift detection, AI
    safety metrics, and responsible AI compliance
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered digital health applications for female health and wellness tracking
  - LLM-based health assistants providing medically accurate information to users
  - Personalized health insights and recommendations powered by fine-tuned language
    models
  - AI-driven user profiling and health data analysis for improved outcomes
  - Responsible AI systems with safety monitoring and medical accuracy evaluation
