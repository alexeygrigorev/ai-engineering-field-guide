      This role is building autonomous AI agents with multi-step
      reasoning, planning, memory, and tool execution
      capabilities. The engineer is directly implementing RAG
      pipelines, integrating LLMs, and developing agent systems -
      core AI engineering work rather than supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Build automated evaluation pipelines for agent reliability, accuracy, and safety
  - Implement multi-step reasoning, planning, and tool-execution loops for AI agents
  - Develop state and memory systems for agent context and knowledge retention
  - Optimize RAG pipelines and retrieval infrastructure
  - Integrate LLMs with APIs, tools, databases, and external systems
  - Implement guardrails, validation layers, retry logic, and failure-handling mechanisms
  - Architect scalable, fault-tolerant backend systems with observability and logging
  - Deploy and maintain services using Docker, CI/CD, and cloud environments
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous AI agents for commercial workflows
  - Multi-step reasoning and planning systems
  - RAG-powered knowledge retrieval for business processes
  - Tool-using AI agents integrated with enterprise systems
  - AI-driven workflow automation in pharmaceutical commercial operations
  - Agent-based decision support and task execution
