    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role is building backend infrastructure, APIs, and
      observability platforms for AI/ML systems - it's an enabler
      role that supports AI engineers rather than directly
      building, training, or deploying models. The engineer is
      creating tools, databases, and monitoring systems that OTHER
      teams use to work with AI/LLMs.
  responsibilities:
  - Write maintainable, scalable, and performant backend code primarily in Go, Java,
    and Python, with opportunities to work in TypeScript
  - Build high-volume and highly available analytics systems
  - Design and build APIs specific to customers' Machine Learning and LLM workflows
  - Prototype, optimize, and maintain scalable backend services that power the Arize
    core platform
  - Extend and contribute back to open source OLAP databases and distributed message
    queue frameworks
  - Develop and integrate collection tools for robust monitoring of ML and LLM pipelines
  - Research and implement cutting-edge visualization & dimensionality reduction algorithms
    in a distributed environment
  - Collaborate with product, design, and customer engineering teams to enhance and
    expand product offerings
  use_cases:
  - Monitoring and observability for AI/LLM systems and agents
  - Model evaluation metrics computation across billions of data points
  - Real-time evaluation infrastructure handling millions of annotations per second
  - Prompt engineering and agent development playgrounds
  - Instrumentation APIs for ML and LLM-powered applications
  - Dimensionality reduction and visualization for ML model insights
