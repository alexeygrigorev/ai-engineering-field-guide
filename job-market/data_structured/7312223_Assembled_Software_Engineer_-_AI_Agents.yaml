position:
  title: Software Engineer - AI Agents
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves directly building and deploying AI
      agents, implementing RAG systems with vector search and re-
      ranking, and working extensively with LLMs for translation,
      categorization, and workflow automation. The engineer will
      develop LLM infrastructure, model evaluation systems, and
      enhance model performance using advanced retrieval
      techniques, which is hands-on AI/ML system development
      rather than support infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Build foundational new features including translation capabilities powered by
    LLMs, intelligent ticket categorization, and intuitive workflow builder interfaces
  - Improve LLM model results by enhancing the RAG engine with vector search, document
    re-ranking, and hypothetical document embeddings
  - Develop LLM infrastructure with abstractions for integrating various LLM types,
    evaluation systems, and logging interfaces
  - Engage with customers including support agents and managers to understand needs
    and gather product feedback
  - Wear multiple hats across coding, user research, planning, brainstorming, interviewing,
    and cross-team collaboration
  - Shape team culture with a startup mentality focused on product quality and taking
    initiative
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous AI agents that handle customer support cases end-to-end
  - AI Copilot that assists human agents with faster, more accurate replies
  - AI-powered workforce management that optimizes human and AI capacity
  - Translation capabilities for multilingual customer support
  - Intelligent categorization and routing of incoming support tickets
  - Workflow automation that distills complex processes into simple interfaces for
    support agents
