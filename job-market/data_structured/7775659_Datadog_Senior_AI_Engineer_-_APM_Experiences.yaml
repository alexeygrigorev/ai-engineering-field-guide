  title: Senior AI Engineer - APM Experiences
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role requires building and deploying LLM- and agent-
      based features directly. The engineer will develop agentic
      workflows, tools, retrieval strategies, guardrails, and
      manage prompts/evals - all hands-on AI/ML system work, not
      just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and ship LLM/agentic workflows that analyze traces, metrics, logs, and
    telemetry to generate diagnoses and guided fixes
  - Prototype quickly, define success metrics and evals, run experiments, and productionize
    AI features for scale and reliability
  - Build robust agent systems with tools, retrieval and planning strategies, guardrails,
    and human-in-the-loop paths
  - Integrate AI capabilities with Datadog's APM platform surfaces like Trace Explorer,
    Service Catalog, monitors, and workflows
  - Write performant backend code and own services in production for high-throughput,
    low-latency data systems
  use_cases:
  - Debug and investigate application performance issues down to root cause using
    AI developer assistants and autonomous agents
  - Proactively recommend performance and reliability optimizations to prevent incidents
  - Automatically create intelligent monitors and SLOs for important business flows
    and critical paths
  - Analyze telemetry data (traces, metrics, logs) to generate performance diagnoses
    and explanations
