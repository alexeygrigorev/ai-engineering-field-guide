  title: Staff AI API Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a backend API engineer role that builds and
      maintains APIs which integrate AI functionality, but does
      not involve building, training, fine-tuning, or deploying
      AI/ML models directly. The role focuses on Python-based API
      development, database architecture, distributed systems, and
      backend infrastructure that supports AI products, making it
      ai-support (working near AI, not on AI).
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and maintain high-performance Python-based backend APIs supporting generative
    and agentic AI products
  - Design and implement scalable, secure, and reliable backend architectures using
    asyncio, FastAPI, gRPC, Kafka, and GraphQL
  - Ensure robust data management with relational and NoSQL databases, Redis caching,
    streaming, and efficient data handling
  - Implement and manage secure zero-trust authentication and authorization schemes
    for public and internal APIs
  - Collaborate with frontend engineers, AI researchers, product managers, and DevOps
    teams to deliver cohesive product experiences
  - Optimize backend services for scalability, reliability, and performance in high-availability
    environments
  use_cases:
  - Generative AI products for cybersecurity threat detection and response
  - Agentic AI systems that automate security operations
  - API-driven access to AI-powered security analysis and threat intelligence
  - Real-time security data processing and analysis through streaming APIs
  - Secure integration of third-party AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini,
    Meta LLaMA) into cybersecurity workflows
