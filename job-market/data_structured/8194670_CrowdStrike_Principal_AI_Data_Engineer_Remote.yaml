  - Ensure availability, performance, scalability, and resiliency of data, analytics,
    and AI platforms
  - Define and implement operational standards including support models, SLAs, escalation
    paths, and incident lifecycle processes
  - Serve as a technical leader and mentor, setting engineering best practices and
    raising the bar across teams
  - Collaborate with data engineering, AI/ML, cloud, security, product, and business
    stakeholders
  use_cases:
  - Conversational AI assistants integrated with Slack and enterprise systems for
    data access
