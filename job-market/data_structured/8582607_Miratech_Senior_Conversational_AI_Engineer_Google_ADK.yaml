    management, and robust error handling to optimize conversational experiences
  - Integrate conversational agents with enterprise platforms (CRM systems, contact
    centers, databases) while ensuring observability through logging, monitoring,
    and performance optimization
  - Provide technical leadership through architecture reviews, mentorship, best-practice
    enforcement, and cross-functional collaboration with product, DevOps, and business
    stakeholders
