    using APIs and scripting from concept to production
  - Leverage low-code and no-code platforms to rapidly prototype and test AI-enabled
    tools with internal stakeholders
  - Act as an AI mentor and coach to raise AI literacy and confidence across CX teams
  - Partner with Governance and Security teams to ensure all AI solutions align with
    policies and standards

  - Automating manual workflows in Customer Experience operations
  - Expanding team capacity through AI-powered tools and workflow integrations
  - Improving accuracy and efficiency in Technical Support and CX processes
