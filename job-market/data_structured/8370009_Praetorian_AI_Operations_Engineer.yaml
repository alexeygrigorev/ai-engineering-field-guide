    Red Teams
  - Architect and automate Identity Access Management (IAM) stacks including Okta
    and SSO
  - Integrate core SaaS stack tools (Salesforce, HubSpot, Linear, Notion) through
    API automation
  - Support HPC and specialized networking environments for penetration testing
  use_cases:
  - Self-service automation replacing manual support tickets with agentic resolution
  - AI-driven CLI and IDE integration (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) into engineering
    workflows
  - Automated SaaS integrations across business tools through API orchestration
