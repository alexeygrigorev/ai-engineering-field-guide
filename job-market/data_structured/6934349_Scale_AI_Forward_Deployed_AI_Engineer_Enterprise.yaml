      This is a Forward Deployed AI Engineer who builds, deploys,
      and optimizes AI agents and LLM-based solutions for
      enterprise customers. The role involves hands-on development
      of multi-agent systems, RAG implementations, prompt
      engineering, and fine-tuning pipelines - directly working ON
      AI models and agents rather than just supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Partner directly with enterprise customers to understand their technical infrastructure,
    data pipelines, and business requirements
  - Design and implement custom integrations between Scale AI's platform and customer
    data environments
  - Develop production-grade AI agents tailored to customer use cases across various
    domains
  - Architect multi-agent systems that orchestrate between different models, tools,
    and data sources
  - Implement RAG systems and fine-tuning pipelines for customer-specific domains
  - Create and maintain prompt engineering strategies, libraries, and best practices
  - Build evaluation frameworks to measure agent performance and iterate toward business
    objectives
  - Serve as the primary technical point of contact for strategic enterprise accounts
  use_cases:
  - Deep research agents for due diligence that perform multi-agent fact-checking
    and process complex unstructured data
  - Churn prediction models with personalized offer curation integrated into copilot
    systems for call centers
  - Voice agents with avatars for gathering unstructured health information in healthcare
    settings
  - Customer support automation using AI agents to handle routine inquiries and workflow
    automation
  - Data analysis and content generation agents tailored to specific enterprise domains
  - Human-in-the-loop workflows for continuous agent improvement and feedback collection
