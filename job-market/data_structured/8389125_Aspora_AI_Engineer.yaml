      This is an AI Engineer role working directly on building,
      deploying, and scaling LLM-powered systems. The
      responsibilities include owning the serving/runtime layer
      for LLMs, integrating agent capabilities and tool calling,
      and designing retrieval systems - all hands-on work with AI
      models and infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Own the serving and runtime layer for all LLM-powered features, ensuring low latency,
    high reliability, and cost efficiency in production
  - Integrate LLM and agent capabilities into real product workflows, including tool
    calling, routing, guardrails, and safe failure modes
  - Build reliable, observable AI workflows across product, ops, and data systems
    with strong foundations in retries, idempotency, fallbacks, and human-in-the-loop
    patterns
  - Design and operate retrieval and knowledge systems end-to-end, from ingestion
    and indexing to retrieval and response composition
  - Automate and harden operational processes, turning manual workflows into scalable,
    measurable pipelines
  - Instrument and monitor AI systems in production, tracking quality regressions,
    drift, prompt failures, and retrieval issues with logs, metrics, and traces
  use_cases:
  - Internal automation tools and workflows
  - LLLM-powered product features with agent capabilities
  - Tool calling, routing, and guardrails for AI workflows
  - Retrieval and knowledge systems for financial information
  - Operational process automation for banking operations
  - Financial workflow automation with human-in-the-loop patterns
