    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves direct hands-on work building AI agent
      systems, including prompt engineering, fine-tuning LLMs,
      synthetic data pipelines, and model evaluation frameworks.
      The engineer will architect agentic AI systems and implement
      techniques for long-context handling and structured outputs,
      which is core AI/ML development work.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect synthetic data pipelines to strengthen model performance on edge cases
  - Lead development of complex evaluation datasets and automated data verification
    systems
  - Build monitoring and optimization systems for continuous production feedback loops
  - Research and implement novel approaches for long-context handling, cascading error
    reduction, and structured outputs
  - Advance prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and control techniques for greater reliability
  - Drive the design and evaluation of production-grade, agentic AI systems at scale
  - Mentor junior engineers and set engineering standards for AI pipelines
  - Partner with product and leadership to shape technical strategy and roadmap
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered survey programming and data processing automation
  - AI agents for market research project management
  - Synthetic data generation for model training and edge case handling
  - Automated evaluation and monitoring of AI system outputs
  - Domain-specific AI copilots for research workflows
  - DSL (Domain Specific Language) processing and structured output generation
