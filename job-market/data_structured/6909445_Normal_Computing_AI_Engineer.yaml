      The role involves hands-on work building LLM-powered
      solutions, implementing multi-agent systems for agentic code
      generation, fine-tuning language models, and using
      reinforcement learning for production systems. This is core
      AI/ML development work, not supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead end-to-end AI development from initial concept through production deployment
    and iteration
  - Design and implement LLM-powered solutions that extract meaning from complex technical
    specifications
  - Handle multi-modal complexity and explore multi-agent and RL approaches for agentic
    code generation and tool-use
  - Design strategies to manage latency, output variance, and graceful error handling
    at scale
  - Collaborate with product and engineering teams to embed AI capabilities seamlessly
    into our platform
  - Guide junior engineers and establish best practices for AI development
  use_cases:
  - Convert large technical documents like chip design specifications into code
  - Extract meaning from complex technical specifications using LLMs
  - Agentic code generation and tool-use for hardware design
  - Document understanding for semiconductor industry applications
