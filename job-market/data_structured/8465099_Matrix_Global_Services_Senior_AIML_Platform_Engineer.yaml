      This role involves hands-on work building and deploying LLM-
      based applications including RAG pipelines, prompt
      engineering, fine-tuning, and multi-agent workflows. The
      engineer directly works with generative AI models and
      implements production-grade AI solutions, not just
      supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and implement end-to-end generative AI solutions using cloud AI ecosystems
    such as Azure AI and Google Vertex AI
  - Lead development of production-grade LLM applications, including RAG pipelines,
    prompt engineering, fine-tuning, LLM grounding, and multi-agent workflows
  - Implement and maintain AI security controls, such as prompt-injection defenses,
    adversarial attack mitigation, data-poisoning detection, and prompt-shielding
    mechanisms
  - Design and maintain scalable MLOps and AIOps pipelines, ensuring automated retraining,
    model versioning, observability, and explainability
  - Translate strategic objectives into actionable AI/ML Proof-of-Concepts and production
    systems demonstrating ROI through iterative development
  - Shape technical strategy for expanding AI/ML capabilities across hybrid cloud
    environments, assessing emerging technologies such as small language models and
    agentic AI
  - Provide mentorship and technical leadership to platform engineers and data scientists
    on advanced ML, LLMOps, and responsible AI methodologies
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise generative AI applications using RAG and LLM grounding
  - Multi-agent workflow systems for business process automation
  - AI security and safety guardrails for enterprise deployment
  - Real-time inference and low-latency edge AI applications
  - Multi-modal content generation including computer vision and advanced NLP
