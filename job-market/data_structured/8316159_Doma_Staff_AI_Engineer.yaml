      This is clearly an AI-first role focused on building,
      deploying, and fine-tuning LLM-based systems for production
      use. The engineer will directly work on developing LLM-
      driven products, fine-tuning models like GPT/Claude/LLaMA,
      and implementing generative AI solutions that integrate with
      knowledge bases and APIs.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build and deploy scalable LLM-based solutions targeting improved operational
    efficiency that integrate external knowledge bases and APIs
  - Own the reliability and ongoing performance of LLM-powered applications, ensuring
    traceability, observability, and regulatory compliance
  - Fine-tune and adapt large language models (e.g., GPT, Claude, LLaMA) to domain-specific
    tasks in real estate and insurance
  - Collaborate with domain experts, data teams, and product managers to research
    and align on AI solutions that satisfy business needs and regulatory constraints
  use_cases:
  - Transform insurance and real estate decision-making processes using generative
    AI
  - Enhance operational efficiency in property and title workflows through LLM-powered
    automation
  - Improve risk assessment and underwriting accuracy for insurance decisions
  - Provide operations intelligence across property, title, and real estate sectors
