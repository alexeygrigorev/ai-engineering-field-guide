      This is a hands-on technical leadership role building
      agentic AI systems from the ground up. The role involves
      directly designing and implementing multi-agent
      architectures, fine-tuning LLMs, building agent evaluation
      pipelines, and owning production AI infrastructure - all
      core ai-first activities working directly on AI systems
      rather than supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead technical evaluation and adoption of cutting-edge agentic AI platforms including
    Anthropic, LangChain/LangGraph, and AWS Bedrock
  - Architect, prototype, and productionize multi-agent AI systems for Agentic SOC
    use cases including detection, triage, investigation, and response workflows
  - Own the design of core agent architecture components including planning, execution,
    tool orchestration, memory, context engineering, and long-running agent workflows
  - Lead AI agent evaluation systems including offline and online evaluation pipelines,
    golden datasets, synthetic data generation, and continuous quality monitoring
  - Drive LLM fine-tuning and alignment efforts to improve domain-specific reasoning,
    accuracy, and reliability for security and observability use cases
  - Design scalable LLMOps and AI agent infrastructure including inference routing,
    latency optimization, cost control, and production observability
  - Partner with product, security, and data platform teams to deliver end-to-end
    AI agent capabilities from prototype to customer-facing production systems
  - Lead technical direction and mentorship for AI engineers working on agentic AI
    and LLM systems
  use_cases:
  - Agentic Security Operations Center (SOC) for automated security incident detection,
    triage, investigation, and response
  - Real-time reasoning over large-scale machine log data to drive security operations
  - Multi-agent systems for security workflows including threat detection and incident
    response
  - LLM-powered analysis of security and observability data with domain-specific fine-tuning
  - Automated investigation and triage workflows using agent-based reasoning
