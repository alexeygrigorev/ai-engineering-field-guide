    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is directly building an enterprise agentic AI
      platform with hands-on implementation of RAG systems, agent
      orchestration engines, LLM integrations, and prompt
      optimization. The engineer will develop core AI services
      including vector database integrations, MCP connectors, and
      evaluation frameworks, which are core AI/ML engineering
      tasks rather than support functions.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement the core architecture of the Enterprise AI Platform including
    low-code interfaces, modular components, and secure infrastructure
  - Build the agent orchestration runtime with task queues, state management, inter-agent
    communication, and long-running workflow capabilities
  - Develop unified low-code and pro-code interfaces for agent workflow composition
    with shared runtime infrastructure
  - Implement AI services including RAG pipelines, vector database integrations, prompt
    optimization, and evaluation guardrails
  - Integrate Model Context Protocols (MCPs) and build enterprise system connectors
    for secure agent operations
  - Establish DevOps pipelines, observability tools, and governance frameworks including
    RBAC, audit logging, and compliance monitoring
  - Architect evaluation-first framework with automated monitoring, hallucination
    detection, bias detection, and performance metrics
  use_cases:
  - Agentic AI automation platform for enterprise workflow orchestration and task
    execution across multiple business domains
  - Low-code citizen developer platform enabling business users and analysts to prototype
    and deploy AI-powered workflows
  - Intelligent document processing including unstructured data extraction, summarization,
    classification, and information retrieval
  - Enterprise system integration connecting AI agents to core business systems for
    automated real-world actions and decision support
  - Healthcare and diagnostics automation with regulatory compliance (HIPAA, SOC2,
    GDPR) for genetic testing and patient data workflows
