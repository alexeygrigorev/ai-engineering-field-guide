      This role involves hands-on building of AI systems including
      Agentic workflows, RAG architectures, and LLM
      implementations to create an enterprise intelligence engine.
      The role directly works with LLMs, agents, and model
      orchestration rather than just supporting AI infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop a unified intelligence layer that ingests signals from disparate sources
    and processes them into actionable outputs
  - Build robust integrations and webhooks to push AI-generated insights directly
    into workflow tools like Salesforce
  - Architect agentic workflows where LLMs are granted permission to perform tasks
    autonomously
  - Implement advanced RAG to ground AI outputs in company documentation, historical
    data, and strategic context
  - Ensure rigorous evaluation and guardrails for non-deterministic models to prevent
    hallucinations in critical business workflows
  - Collaborate with Analytics Engineers to ensure underlying data pipelines support
    real-time AI applications
  - Maintain security and privacy standards ensuring AI agents respect data access
    permissions across departments
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise intelligence automation connecting product telemetry, CRM, call transcripts,
    and marketing data
  - Automated churn risk alerting by pushing AI insights into Salesforce and other
    business tools
  - Agentic workflows that autonomously execute tasks across business systems
  - Knowledge retrieval using RAG grounded in company documentation and historical
    data
  - Real-time lead qualification and customer support automation
  - Cross-functional data synthesis for strategic business intelligence
