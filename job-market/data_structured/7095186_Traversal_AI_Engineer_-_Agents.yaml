    AI Site Reliability Engineer for enterprise - AI agents for
    observability and incident troubleshooting
position:
  title: AI Engineer - Agents
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work with LLMs and AI agents
      including designing multi-step reasoning workflows, prompt
      engineering, function calling, agentic orchestration, and
      deploying frontier LLMs in production. The engineer will
      directly build, optimize, and deploy AI systems rather than
      just supporting infrastructure or data pipelines for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build multi-step reasoning workflows that use LLMs and other components
    to analyze large-scale observability data
  - Develop tooling for prompt engineering, function calling, and agentic orchestration
    that optimizes latency, reliability, and performance
  - Integrate AI components into a robust, scalable production environment with low
    latency and high uptime requirements
  - Prototype and test new LLMs, prompting strategies, and fine-tuning approaches
    to improve the quality and coverage of agentic responses
  - Work closely with backend, infra, and product teams to ensure AI agents are well-integrated
    into the broader system
  - Build evaluation and monitoring tools for agent performance and reliability across
    production workloads
  use_cases:
  - Troubleshoot, remediate, and prevent complex production incidents in enterprise
    environments
  - Analyze large-scale observability data including logs, metrics, and traces
  - Automate incident debugging and resolution through intelligent agent workflows
  - Provide AI-powered site reliability engineering capabilities
  - Enable engineers to focus on creative work by reducing firefighting
  - Scale agentic architectures across distributed systems and environments
