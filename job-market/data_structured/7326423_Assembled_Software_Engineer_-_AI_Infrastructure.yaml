  title: Software Engineer - AI Infrastructure
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role is building infrastructure and platforms that
      power LLM-based agents, not building or fine-tuning models
      themselves. The engineer works on inference routing, storage
      systems, observability, and developer tools that enable AI
      work, which aligns with ai-support classification.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and operate core infrastructure powering the AI agent platform for customer
    support at scale
  - Manage agent service reliability and scaling including inference strategies, model
    provider integrations, and dynamic traffic routing
  - Develop prompt and embedding storage systems with fast-access storage and indexing
    layers for real-time AI interactions
  - Implement privacy and security systems including intrusion detection, audit logging,
    and LLM usage policy enforcement
  - Operate observability and usage analytics systems tracking token usage, latency,
    cost, and quality signals
  - Explore and build AI-powered developer tools including internal chat agents and
    intelligent automation for deployment and debugging
  use_cases:
  - AI Agents that automate customer support workflows across email, chat, and voice
    channels
  - AI Copilot providing real-time assistance to human support agents
  - AI-powered workforce management optimizing both human and AI capacity
  - Dynamic routing of LLM requests for performance and cost efficiency
  - Semantic search across support content using embeddings and vector databases
  - Enterprise-grade AI systems with strict privacy, security, and compliance guardrails
