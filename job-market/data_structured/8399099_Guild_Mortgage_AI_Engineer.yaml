      teams.
  responsibilities:
  - Source relevant data from various channels including databases, online sources,
    and internal systems for training AI models
  - Process raw data through cleaning, normalizing, and segmenting to prepare it for
    machine learning use
  - Create machine learning models using appropriate algorithms to solve business
    problems and enhance application capabilities
  - Rigorously test AI models to ensure accuracy, reliability, and robustness against
    predefined metrics
  - Integrate AI models into existing software applications using API calls or embedded
    code
  - Continuously optimize AI systems for better speed, efficiency, and accuracy to
    meet performance standards
  - Utilize cloud computing platforms for efficient AI model development, testing,
    and deployment
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate AI solutions into business
    processes
  use_cases:
  - Enhancing user interface and user experience of applications to make them more
    intuitive and responsive
  - Solving specific business problems in mortgage banking and home financing through
    AI-driven solutions
  - Improving application capabilities by integrating machine learning models trained
    on relevant datasets
  - Automating data processing and analysis to support lending operations and decision-making
  - Providing insights and reports to management through AI system performance analysis
  - Integrating AI into various business processes to align with organizational objectives
