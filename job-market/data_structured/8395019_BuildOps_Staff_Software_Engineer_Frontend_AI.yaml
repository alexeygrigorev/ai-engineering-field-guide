    reasoning: |-
      This is a Staff Frontend Engineer role focused on building
      UI/UX interfaces for AI-powered features ("OpsAI"), not
      building, training, or deploying AI/ML models themselves.
      The engineer works on frontend architecture, interaction
      patterns, and user experience to present AI capabilities
      from backend/ML teams, which is enabling AI work rather than
      directly working on AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Define and evolve front-end architecture for AI-driven product experiences across
    multiple modules and experiences
  - Establish cohesive interaction model for AI as an operating layer across the platform
  - Build novel AI interfaces including guardrails, safe-action patterns, and UX for
    AI quality signals
  - Own key UI technical decisions including state management, data loading patterns,
    performance budgets, accessibility, and observability
  - Partner with Design to create human-in-the-loop interaction patterns and collaborate
    with backend/ML teams on API contracts
  - Define and instrument UX and product metrics tied to AI success including time
    saved, reduced errors, and adoption rates
  use_cases:
  - System of Action software that actively drives decisions and automates workflows
    for commercial contractors
  - AI-powered operational workflows including service department management and project
    management
  - Semi-autonomous workflows with human-in-the-loop decision making and oversight
  - Real-time workflow orchestration and automation using AI to drive operational
    efficiency
  - Auditability and transparency features for automated actions with history, attribution,
    and rollback capabilities
