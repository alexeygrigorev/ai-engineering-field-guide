      This is a governance role that designs guardrails, policies,
      and infrastructure for AI systems but does not involve
      building, training, fine-tuning, or deploying models. The
      role works at the intersection of cloud engineering, MLOps,
      and data governance to enable AI adoption across the
      organization without hands-on model development.

    teams
  - Build monitoring and reporting frameworks for AI models and tools emphasizing
    cost tracking and AI FinOps principles
  - Develop and manage ML/AI Ops pipelines including CI/CD for model deployment and
    version control using GitHub Actions or Jenkins
  - Design and implement AI infrastructure as code through Terraform or AWS CloudFormation
    for consistent environment management
  - Support multi-cloud AI workloads across AWS SageMaker, GCP Vertex AI, Azure ML,
    Snowflake Cortex, and Databricks
  - Build AI consumption metrics dashboards with guardrails using tools like Llamaguard,
    LangGraph, and LangChain
  - Enable RBAC on AI models across tools/LLMs enforcing IAM policies for secure access
  - Implement technical guardrails including fairness constraints, bias detection,
    and transparency measures in AI tools and models

  - AI model governance and compliance for media and entertainment platforms
  - Deploying AI systems across streaming, broadcast, film studios, and theme parks
  - Enforcing data privacy and security guardrails for AI agents and models
  - Managing multi-cloud AI workloads with cost optimization and usage tracking
