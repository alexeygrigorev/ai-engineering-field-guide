    production environments
  - Improve model accuracy, scalability, latency, and operational performance through
    disciplined optimization
  - Design reusable AI components, services, and frameworks that accelerate development
    and reduce rework
  - Implement and refine MLOps workflows to streamline experimentation, testing, and
    deployment
  - Experiment with GenAI and LLM frameworks such as LangChain, Semantic Kernel, and
    Azure OpenAI
