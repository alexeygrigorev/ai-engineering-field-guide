    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work with AI/ML systems including
      designing, building, and maintaining AI architectures,
      deploying LLMs and RAG systems, and implementing multi-
      agentic workflows using frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen,
      and CrewAI. This is direct model and agent development work,
      not just infrastructure or support.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and maintain scalable AI architectures and pipelines supporting
    predictive modelling and Generative AI applications
  - Operationalise Large Language Models (GPT, Llama, Mistral) and NLP workflows for
    production environments
  - Design and orchestrate autonomous multi-agent workflows using frameworks like
    LangChain, AutoGen, or CrewAI
  - Ensure model deployments are supported by robust data storage, vector databases,
    and cloud infrastructure
  - Act as a practitioner and mentor for AI-assisted coding tools and agentic coding
    workflows
  - Provide technical consulting on AI product development, helping clients understand
    ML versus agentic AI distinctions
  - Stay updated with modern AI stack trends including synthetic data generation and
    Explainable AI
  use_cases:
  - Generative AI applications for advanced analysis in regulated environments
  - Multi-agent systems that reason, plan, and execute tasks across multiple tools
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures for semantic search and knowledge
    retrieval
  - AI-assisted development workflows to accelerate engineering velocity
  - Predictive modelling solutions for business requirements
  - Operational NLP workflows using BERT and topic modelling for production environments
