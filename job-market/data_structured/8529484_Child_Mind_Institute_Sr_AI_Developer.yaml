      The role involves hands-on work building, training,
      evaluating, and deploying large language models and agentic
      AI systems. The candidate will design and implement NLP
      solutions, refine LLMs for clinical contexts, and develop
      automated evaluation frameworks - all direct work on AI
      models themselves rather than supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop machine learning models with focus on NLP and LLMs for mental health applications
  - Develop and improve LLMs and agentic AI systems for generating synthetic multi-turn
    conversation data
  - Build automated evaluation systems for assessing model performance and safety
  - Collaborate with clinical experts to translate therapeutic expectations into quantifiable
    AI evaluation criteria
  - Conduct evaluation of AI systems using expert-annotated benchmarks and perform
    longitudinal analysis
  - Ensure data quality, security, and compliance with privacy regulations for sensitive
    clinical data
  - Contribute to scalable, well-documented code for web applications and analytic
    pipelines
  use_cases:
  - Mental health assessment and support tools
  - Synthetic multi-turn conversation generation for clinical training
  - Automated clinical evaluation frameworks for AI safety and effectiveness
  - Longitudinal analysis of AI model behavior in healthcare contexts
  - Privacy-compliant handling of sensitive clinical data
