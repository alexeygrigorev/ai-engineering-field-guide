position:
  title: AI Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      Role involves hands-on work building, training, and
      deploying AI models including LLMs, RAG systems, and agentic
      frameworks. The engineer will develop explainable AI
      systems, implement LLM-based solutions using frameworks like
      LangChain and LlamaIndex, and work directly with PyTorch and
      Google's Model Garden. This is active model development and
      deployment, not just infrastructure support.
  responsibilities:
  - Collaborate with AI and MLOps teams to create, train, and test models focusing
    on scientific accuracy and domain relevance
  - Lead agile teams of engineers, product managers, and SMEs to execute on engineering
    excellence
  - Build transparent and explainable AI systems for life sciences applications where
    trustworthiness is paramount
  - Design and build robust pipelines using cloud infrastructure for ingesting structured
    and unstructured data
  - Develop domain-specific AI solutions that address medical and scientific language
    complexity while maintaining regulatory compliance
  - Advocate for AI best practices internally across tools and services, and externally
    for product team integration
  use_cases:
  - Processing complex structured and unstructured data from diverse life sciences
    sources
  - Delivering insights to medical professionals that they can trust and act upon
  - Addressing medical and scientific language complexity with high precision in healthcare
    applications
  - Accelerating patient access to life-saving treatments through improved decision-making
  - Empowering top Pharma companies, scientists, and researchers with AI-powered natural
    language understanding
