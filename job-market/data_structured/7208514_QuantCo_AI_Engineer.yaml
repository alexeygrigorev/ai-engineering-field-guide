      Role involves building, deploying, and implementing AI
      systems directly, including LLM-based components like RAG,
      and may include forward-deployed engineering. This is hands-
      on work with models, not just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, test, and deploy AI systems embedded at scale in enterprise settings
  - Lead the design of data and inference pipelines for production-ready AI applications
  - Orchestrate the integration of LLM-based components including retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG)
  - Develop custom tooling for efficient experimentation and evaluation of LLM applications
    and agentic workflows
  - Balance engineering constraints with business priorities throughout product development
    lifecycle
  - Collaborate with data scientists to solve problems in inference optimization,
    scalable systems design, and human-computer interaction
  use_cases:
  - Algorithmic pricing optimization for large organizations
  - Data-driven claims management systems
  - High-dimensional forecasting systems
  - Decision support systems that improve human decision quality
  - Enterprise AI applications that unlock operational efficiencies
  - Core business process transformation using advanced AI/ML solutions
