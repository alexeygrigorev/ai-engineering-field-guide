    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      The job title includes "AI Lead Engineer" but the
      description focuses entirely on general software engineering
      practices: development lifecycle, code reusability,
      security, testing, and mentoring. There is no mention of
      building, training, fine-tuning, or deploying AI/ML models,
      suggesting this is a general SWE role at an AI-related
      company (dentsu/Merkle) rather than hands-on AI development.
  responsibilities:
  - Participates in the entire software development cycle including requirements analysis,
    design, development, unit testing and documentation
  - Ensures long-term code reusability and stability of software solutions
  - Proactively identifies security and usability issues and formulates strategies
    to resolve them
  - Takes ownership for delivery of complex application features and resolves key
    technical issues
  - Mentors new software engineers and participates in knowledge sharing and training
    delivery
  - Integrates new technologies and follows company release processes
