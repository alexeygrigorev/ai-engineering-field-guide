    reasoning: |-
      This is a Solutions Engineer role that requires hands-on
      experience training, fine-tuning, evaluating, and deploying
      deep learning and LLM-based systems. The role involves
      architecting RAG pipelines, multi-agent systems, LLM fine-
      tuning workflows, and building working prototypes that
      demonstrate real customer value, which aligns with building
      and deploying AI/ML systems rather than just supporting AI
      work.
  responsibilities:
  - Build proof of value engagements and partner with Account Executives to drive
    discovery, solution design, and technical evaluations
  - Lead technical conversations with ML engineers and researchers to architect scalable
    solutions across the CoreWeave and Weights & Biases ecosystem
  - Design and deliver demos and prototypes showcasing experiment tracking, distributed
    training, agentic workflows, fine-tuning, evaluation, and inference at scale
  - Architect modern ML and GenAI systems including distributed training, RAG pipelines,
    multi-agent systems, and LLM fine-tuning workflows
  - Translate business objectives into measurable technical outcomes such as model
    quality improvements, cost reductions, and performance gains
  - Serve as a trusted technical advisor influencing architectural decisions and best
    practices across MLOps, LLMOps, and platform engineering
  - Partner with Product and Engineering to relay customer feedback and shape roadmap
    priorities
  use_cases:
  - Distributed training of deep learning models at scale
  - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines for enterprise applications
  - Multi-agent systems with tool-using capabilities
  - LLM fine-tuning and evaluation workflows
  - Experiment tracking and model optimization
  - Inference serving and optimization at scale
