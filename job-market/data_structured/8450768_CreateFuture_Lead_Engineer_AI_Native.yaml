  title: Lead Engineer (AI Native)

    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role is about using AI tools as a force multiplier for
      software engineering and consulting - not building,
      training, or deploying AI models. The role focuses on
      applying AI to improve software delivery practices,
      observability, and documentation while working as a
      consultant helping clients with AI-native transformation.
      The engineer uses AI tools extensively but the core work is
      software architecture and delivery, not model development.
  responsibilities:
  - Work closely with client teams to understand their context, constraints, and goals,
    turning ambiguous problems into clear, workable approaches
  - Design and build software across different parts of a system, making pragmatic
    decisions that balance speed, quality, and long-term maintainability
  - Use AI tools extensively throughout the delivery lifecycle to support research,
    context exploration, architecture, implementation, testing, and documentation
  - Help clients make deliberate AI-focused technology and tooling choices that avoid
    unnecessary lock-in and allow delivery approaches to evolve
  - Share learning with both client teams and colleagues to improve delivery practices
    and deliver external thought leadership at conferences and meetups
  use_cases:
  - AI-native transformation of client teams and ways of working
  - Software development acceleration using AI tools across the delivery lifecycle
  - AI-assisted research, context exploration, and architecture design
  - AI-powered testing, verification, and build automation
  - Technology and tooling selection to avoid vendor lock-in in AI implementations
