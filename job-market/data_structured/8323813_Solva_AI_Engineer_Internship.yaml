      Role directly involves building AI systems using LLMs, fine-
      tuning, RAG, and agent workflows. Hands-on work with model
      experimentation, evaluation, and deployment for claims
      decision support.
  responsibilities:
  - Work on AI systems behind claims decision support and reasoning
  - Develop agent workflows, evaluation pipelines, retrieval logic and prompt strategies
  - Experiment with LLMs, fine-tuning, RAG, embeddings and model selection
  - Stress test outputs and build robust engineering systems
  - Ship fast, iterate with customers and solve messy problems
  - Build internal tools, dashboards and analysis frameworks
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered claims decision support for insurers
  - Automated reasoning and evaluation of insurance claims
  - Retrieval-based systems for insurance data analysis
  - Agent-based workflows for claims processing
  - Fine-tuned LLMs for insurance domain decisions
