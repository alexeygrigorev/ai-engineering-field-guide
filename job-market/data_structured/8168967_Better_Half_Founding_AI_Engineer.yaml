  title: Founding AI Engineer

    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is an AI-first role focused on building an
      orchestration engine for LLMs that translates relational
      intelligence decisions into natural conversation. The
      engineer will work directly on prompt engineering,
      constrained generation, multi-model LLM orchestration, and
      transformer-based emotion analysis - all hands-on AI/ML
      system building work.
  responsibilities:
  - Build affect analysis pipeline with real-time emotion detection and multi-modal
    sentiment analysis
  - Develop memory systems for storing and retrieving relational context across sessions
  - Engineer prompt systems and constrained generation that translates decisions into
    natural conversation
  - Implement multi-model LLM orchestration with latency optimization and fallback
    strategies
  - Design and deploy cloud infrastructure on AWS/GCP with PostgreSQL and vector stores
  - Build evaluation harnesses that measure relational outcomes through tracing and
    feedback loops
  use_cases:
  - High-stakes relational AI for mental health, consumer social, robotics, defense,
    and education
  - Trustworthy AI systems that optimize for user thriving rather than engagement
  - Real-time conversation systems that provide appropriate pushback, softening, or
    repair interventions
  - Multi-modal emotion detection and escalation tracking in conversation contexts
  - Long-term modeling of user growth trajectories and relational capacity across
    sessions
