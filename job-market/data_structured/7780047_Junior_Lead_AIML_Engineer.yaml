    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is an AI/ML engineering role that involves directly
      building LLM-powered systems including prompt optimization,
      agentic entity deduplication, knowledge graphs with agentic
      infrastructure, and search ranking algorithms. The hands-on
      work with LLMs, prompt engineering, and agent deployment
      qualifies this as ai-first, not just supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Build LLM-powered systems including prompt optimization and agentic infrastructure
  - Develop search ranking algorithms integrating user interaction signals with semantic
    and text search
  - Create agentic entity deduplication systems for investment research data
  - Build and maintain knowledge graphs from unstructured interview data using agents
  - Conduct NLP research synthesis and prove business value for investment research
    use cases
  - Contribute to product decisions, direction, and engineering culture as an early
    ML hire
  use_cases:
  - Investment research process automation for private equity and consulting firms
  - Semantic search and ranking across unstructured text and interview data
  - Entity resolution and deduplication from speech-to-text output in investment research
  - Knowledge graph construction from unstructured interview data for research sprints
  - LLM-powered prompt systems that continuously refine outputs using production signals
  - Investment research benchmarking and evaluation using LLM outputs
