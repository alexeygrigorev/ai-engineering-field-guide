      This role involves hands-on work building and deploying LLM
      applications - prompt engineering, fine-tuning models,
      implementing RAG workflows, and building AI microservices.
      The engineer is directly working ON AI systems (LLMs, vector
      databases, model serving) rather than supporting others who
      do.
  responsibilities:
  - Craft, iterate, and optimize prompts for LLM APIs and build multi-step chains
    using LangChain or LlamaIndex
  - Implement retrieval-augmented workflows with document ingestion, embedding indexing,
    and similarity search
  - Create interactive AI demos and proofs-of-concept using Streamlit, Gradio, or
    Next.js
  - Develop and maintain AI microservices using Docker, Kubernetes, and FastAPI for
    model serving
  - Implement CI/CD pipelines, experiment tracking, and model monitoring for production
    workflows
  - Participate in code reviews, architectural discussions, and sprint planning to
    deliver features end-to-end
  use_cases:
  - LLM-powered automation and orchestration for trading platform workflows
  - Retrieval-augmented generation for document search and information access
  - Rapid prototyping of AI applications for stakeholder validation
  - AI microservices integration into existing trading platform infrastructure
