    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work building and deploying
      agentic Voice AI systems using LLMs and Generative AI
      technologies. The Principal Engineer will design, research,
      and train LLM applications, integrate OpenAI/ChatGPT APIs,
      implement agentic orchestration strategies, and fine-tune
      models using LoRA/QLoRA. This is direct work ON AI systems,
      not just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Provide directional leadership in the voice ordering system's agentic system design,
    architecture, and orchestration strategies
  - Work directly with executive leadership to solve and roadmap business critical
    implementations into the voice application
  - Build and maintain enterprise-grade Python based systems that integrate LLM and
    Generative AI frameworks to support end-to-end AI product pipeline
  - Design CI/CD pipelines for orchestrated LLM driven agentic services and manage
    deployments across cloud environments
  - Own custom model testing, monitoring, and maintenance to ensure reliability throughout
    the full ML model life cycle
  - Design prototypes and POCs that demonstrate feasibility, validate approach, and
    support product direction
  - Research, design, and train LLM applications aimed at solving real operational
    challenges inside restaurant environments
  - Provide technical guidance on adopting and integrating LLM capabilities with internal
    teams and external partners
  use_cases:
  - Real-time drive-thru automation for restaurants
  - Voice ordering systems for food service
  - Agentic AI systems for customer service interactions
  - LLM-powered conversational interfaces for high-volume environments
  - Production AI solutions achieving 80%+ accuracy at scale
