  title: Senior Enterprise AI Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves building and deploying AI assistants,
      agents, and AI-powered applications directly, implementing
      RAG systems, agent orchestration, and production inference
      services. The engineer will work on fine-tuning models,
      evaluation frameworks, and MLOps pipelines for the model
      lifecycle, which is hands-on work with AI/ML systems rather
      than just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement AI-powered solutions including assistants, agents, and applications
    that solve business problems across enterprise functions
  - Build platform capabilities for modern AI workloads including retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG), agent orchestration, evaluation, and production inference services
  - Implement scalable services that support low-latency, high-throughput AI applications
    while meeting reliability, security, and cost objectives
  - Develop reusable patterns, libraries, and best practices that enable teams to
    safely and efficiently build on the Enterprise AI Platform
  - Support rapid experimentation (POCs), evaluate emerging AI tools/frameworks, and
    help evolve platform architecture to incorporate successful innovations into production
  - Contribute to MLOps pipelines including training, fine-tuning, versioning, deployment,
    monitoring, and drift detection to streamline the model lifecycle
  - Help define and implement automated testing strategies for AI solutions including
    quality, safety, regression, hallucination checks, latency, and robustness
  use_cases:
  - AI assistants and agents for internal business operations across Sales, Marketing,
    Finance, HR, Legal, Customer Support, and IT
  - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for enterprise knowledge access and
    decision support
  - Agentic workflows for automating business processes and increasing productivity
  - AI-powered applications for customer support and enterprise productivity enhancement
