    reasoning: |-
      This is a Platform Engineer role focused on building cloud-
      native infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and developer
      tooling that powers AI/ML systems rather than directly
      building, training, or deploying models. The role builds the
      platform and infrastructure that enables AI/ML engineers to
      work on Agentic workloads and generative AI agents.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and maintain cloud-native platforms that power Agentic AI workloads and
    orchestration systems
  - Design and implement scalable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective production
    infrastructure using Kubernetes, Vercel, AWS, GCP, and AI platforms
  - Develop Go command-line tools and services that streamline and empower developer
    workflows from local development to production deployment
  - Build and maintain golden path reference implementations for automated build,
    test, and deploy workflows using GitHub Actions, Playwright, and Snyk
  - Design and implement comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting solutions
    using DataDog and LLM observability tools
  - Establish platform security best practices using multi-cloud strategies and open-source
    CNCF solutions
  - Collaborate with AI/ML engineers, frontend developers, product managers, and SREs
    to build robust services and developer experiences
  - Establish, measure, and continuously improve DORA metrics to optimize product
    delivery velocity and quality
  use_cases:
  - Generative AI agents for tax, accounting, and audit professionals
  - AI-driven orchestration systems powering CoCounsel for Tax and Accounting
  - AI native products for accounting professionals that automate and enhance workflows
  - Agent-based architectures using LLMs and AI APIs from providers like OpenAI and
    Anthropic
  - Search-based AI systems leveraging vector databases and embeddings
  - Production infrastructure supporting secure, performant, and reliable AI-driven
    solutions
