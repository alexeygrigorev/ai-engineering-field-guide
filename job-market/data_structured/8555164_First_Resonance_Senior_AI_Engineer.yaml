    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work building AI/ML systems
      including RAG pipelines, generative procedure creation,
      anomaly detection, and recommendations. The engineer
      directly designs and implements AI features using LLMs and
      connects models to data sources via MCP, which is direct AI
      system development.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the design, implementation, and optimization of production-ready AI systems
    within the ION Factory OS
  - Ship customer-facing features including AI-driven functionality such as generative
    procedure creation, anomaly detection, and recommendations
  - Design and implement AI features using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines
    to deliver context-aware insights
  - Leverage Model Context Protocol (MCP) and frameworks to connect AI models with
    data sources and external tools
  - Architect and maintain scalable software systems including AI/ML pipelines and
    broader product infrastructure
  - Partner with data engineering to process and transform structured and unstructured
    manufacturing data
  use_cases:
  - Generative procedure creation for manufacturing workflows
  - Anomaly detection in manufacturing processes
  - Context-aware recommendations using RAG
  - Manufacturing workflow acceleration for hardware builders
  - Data processing and insights for eVTOLs, rockets, robots, and autonomous vehicles
