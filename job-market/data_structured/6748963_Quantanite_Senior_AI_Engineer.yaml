      This role involves hands-on work building, deploying, and
      fine-tuning LLMs and agentic systems using frameworks like
      LangChain, LlamaIndex, and OpenAI SDK. The responsibilities
      explicitly include building RAG pipelines, implementing
      multi-agent workflows, and deploying AI solutions to
      production, which are core AI engineering tasks.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and deploy agentic systems and multi-agent workflows using frameworks like
    LangChain, LlamaIndex, and OpenAI SDK
  - Develop RAG pipelines using embeddings and vector databases such as FAISS, Pinecone,
    Weaviate, and Qdrant
  - Fine-tune and optimize LLMs including GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemini
    using techniques like LoRA/QLoRA and quantization
  - Ensure solutions are secure and compliant with guardrails, safe API usage, and
    PII protection
  - Implement agent monitoring and evaluation with tools like LangSmith or AgentOps
    to track and improve performance
  - Deliver real-world enterprise use cases including AI copilots, workflow orchestration,
    and intelligent search systems
  - Mentor junior AI Engineers by reviewing work, sharing best practices, and supporting
    their growth
  - Collaborate with product, data, and DevOps teams to bring AI solutions to production
    at scale
  use_cases:
  - AI copilots for enterprise productivity and task assistance
  - Enterprise search solutions for intelligent information retrieval
  - Summarization engines for document and content processing
  - Intelligent automation tools for workflow optimization
  - Workflow orchestration for business process automation
  - Research copilots for knowledge discovery and analysis
