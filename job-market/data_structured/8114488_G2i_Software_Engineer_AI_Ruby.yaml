  title: Software Engineer, AI (Ruby)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves generating training data and feedback for
      RLHF pipelines rather than building, training, or deploying
      models directly. The engineer reviews and critiques AI-
      generated code to create reward signals, but does not work
      on model architecture, training, or inference systems. This
      is human feedback work that supports AI development without
      being hands-on AI engineering.
  responsibilities:
  - Compare and rank multiple code snippets, explaining which implementation is best
    and why
  - Repair and refactor AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and style
  - Inject feedback including ratings, edits, and test results into the RLHF pipeline
  - Provide detailed code reviews to spot logic errors, performance issues, and security
    vulnerabilities
  - Generate expert-level feedback that serves as reward signals for reinforcement
    learning model tuning
  - Maintain smooth operation of the RLHF pipeline through consistent, high-quality
    human evaluations
  use_cases:
  - Training large language models to write production-grade Ruby code
  - Using human feedback to improve code generation quality through RLHF
  - Developing models that can propose, critique, and improve code like expert engineers
  - Converting expert code reviews into reward signals for reinforcement learning
  - Teaching LLMs to avoid common logic errors, performance traps, and security issues
