      This is a QA Engineer role focused on testing and validating
      AI/ML systems rather than building or deploying them. The
      candidate designs test cases, creates automation frameworks,
      and validates the work of ML engineers - this is
      enabling/testing work, not hands-on model development.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and execute manual and automated test cases for backend APIs, frontend
    interfaces, and end-to-end AI workflows
  - Conduct exploratory testing of new generative AI features and user interactions
  - Build automation scripts for AI/ML pipelines using pytest, unittest, or custom
    frameworks
  - Validate RAG pipelines including embedding accuracy, retrieval quality, and model
    response evaluation
  - Test AI agents and orchestration flows ensuring correctness in multi-step reasoning
    and tool invocations
  - Perform performance and scalability testing for ML inference endpoints monitoring
    latency and throughput
  - Integrate and maintain automated test suites within CI/CD pipelines
  - Collaborate with ML engineers, data scientists, and developers to reproduce issues
    and validate fixes
  use_cases:
  - Legal operations and workflow automation
  - Risk and compliance management
  - Document summarization and retrieval
  - Enterprise search using RAG pipelines
  - Multi-step AI agent reasoning and tool use
  - Inference API testing for LLM applications
