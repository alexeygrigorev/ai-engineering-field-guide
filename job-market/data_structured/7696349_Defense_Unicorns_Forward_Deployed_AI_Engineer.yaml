    reasoning: |-
      This is a Forward Deployed Engineer role that involves
      hands-on building, deploying, and operating agentic
      Generative AI systems including RAG, context engineering,
      and APIs. The role directly implements AI solutions at
      customer sites, not just infrastructure or support work.
  responsibilities:
  - Embed with strategic customers as a technical partner from problem discovery to
    solution implementation and adoption
  - Architect, build, deploy, and operate agentic Generative AI systems including
    APIs, ETL pipelines, integration layers, RAG, and context engineering
  - Deploy systems in cloud, on-prem, and edge/air-gapped environments to meet mission
    requirements
  - Scope, sequence, and lead delivery of solutions including living roadmaps, priorities,
    and trade-offs between speed, quality, and scope
  - Codify reusable patterns and build tools, internal frameworks, and playbooks for
    faster, safer, repeatable deployments
  - Act as the technical face to customer leadership, communicating with both technical
    and non-technical stakeholders to build trust and ensure adoption
  use_cases:
  - Deploying agentic Generative AI systems for defense and government applications
  - Enabling Retrieval Augmented Generation for information access and decision support
    in tactical environments
  - Delivering AI capabilities in air-gapped and secure environments for warfighter
    operations
  - Building context engineering solutions that integrate LLMs into larger system
    architectures
  - Supporting mission-critical software delivery with rapid deployment and secure
    AI integration
