      This role involves building an internal AI agent platform
      from scratch, creating 50+ specialized agents using LLM
      techniques, implementing RAG pipelines and embedding
      systems, and working directly with AI frameworks like
      OpenAI/Claude APIs. The engineer will hands-on develop,
      deploy, and iterate on agent-based solutions, not just
      support others who build AI.
  responsibilities:
  - Design Imprints internal agent platform from the ground up
  - Create 50+ specialized AI agents automating workflows across engineering, operations,
    customer success, finance, and business development
  - Build secure, scalable agent orchestration systems integrating with existing tech
    stack and internal systems
  - Partner with teams across Imprint to identify high-impact automation opportunities
    and transform manual processes into intelligent workflows
  - Implement RAG pipelines, embedding systems, and multi-modal AI solutions using
    cutting-edge frameworks
  - Rapidly prototype with LLM APIs while balancing experimental innovation with production
    reliability and security
  use_cases:
  - Automating internal workflows across multiple departments including engineering,
    operations, finance, and business development
  - Integrating AI agents with internal systems like CRMs, data warehouses, and communication
    tools to streamline operations
  - Creating intelligent, self-improving workflows that replace manual processes and
    increase team efficiency
  - Building secure agent orchestration systems that leverage LLMs for process automation
  - Enabling non-technical users to access advanced AI capabilities through intuitive
    interfaces
