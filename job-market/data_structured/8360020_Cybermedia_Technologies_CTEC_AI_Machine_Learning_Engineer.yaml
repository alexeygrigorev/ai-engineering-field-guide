    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is hands-on building AI systems: developing
      Agentic AI with LLMs, implementing RAG, and deploying
      autonomous agents with multi-step reasoning. The engineer
      directly constructs, integrates, and monitors AI models and
      agents for automated decision-making.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and deploy autonomous AI agents with multi-step reasoning, tool-use, and
    self-correction for federal benefit policies
  - Develop guardrail layers that synchronize probabilistic LLM outputs with deterministic
    business rules for regulatory compliance
  - Implement advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solutions with layout-aware
    parsing for document processing
  - Design and evaluate hybrid machine learning models combining data-driven predictions
    with rule-based automation
  - Deploy models to cloud environments with LLM-specific observability including
    tracing, hallucination monitoring, and drift detection
  - Ensure AI determinations have clear, human-readable audit trails and explainable
    reasoning chains
  - Collaborate with architects and stakeholders to translate health insurance policies
    into executable AI logic
  use_cases:
  - Automating health benefits determinations for the Office of Personnel Management
    (OPM)
  - Navigating and interpreting complex federal benefit policies using AI agents
  - Extracting and processing information from dense federal manuals and unstructured
    documentation
  - Ensuring compliance and auditability in automated government decision-making workflows
  - Hybrid decision-making combining LLM reasoning with deterministic rule validation
