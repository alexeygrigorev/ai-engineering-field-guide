      This role involves building and training models for
      CodeMender, an AI agent for code security. The position
      requires hands-on work with fine-tuning, reinforcement
      learning, and training new models directly on AI/ML systems
      for vulnerability detection and code generation.
  responsibilities:
  - Developing strategies and solutions to advance the agent's abilities to solve
    code security challenges
  - Integrating novel agentic techniques into research prototypes
  - Training new models using fine tuning or reinforcement learning techniques
  - Building evaluation pipelines, benchmarks, and leaderboards
  - Working with product teams to gather research and product requirements
  - Consulting on the deployment of research-based solutions to products
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered vulnerability discovery in software
  - Automated patching of new security vulnerabilities
  - Proactive code rewriting to eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities
  - AI-assisted code security analysis and remediation
  - Zero-day exploit detection in well-tested software
