      This is a Senior Frontend Engineer role focused on building
      UI interfaces for AI-powered workflows. The engineer will
      create the frontend layer that displays AI functionality but
      will NOT build, train, fine-tune, or deploy the actual AI
      models - they are working on the presentation layer and user
      experience around AI features.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build highly interactive, visual UI on top of Miro's real-time canvas
  - 'Shape the core Flows experience: how users create, understand, run, and trust
    AI workflows'
  - Turn fuzzy product ideas and design intent into clean, intuitive, polished interfaces
  - Work closely with product and design to explore new interaction patterns for AI
    in a collaborative environment
  - Take ownership end-to-end from problem framing to implementation to iteration
    and refinement
  - Improve performance, architecture, and UX quality wherever there is friction
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered workflows that turn intent into structured steps, suggestions, and
    actions on the canvas
  - Help teams go from idea to outcome faster using AI-generated workflows
  - Enabling users to create, understand, run, and trust AI workflows directly in
    their visual workspace
  - Mainstream product AI experience for millions of users at work
  - Collaborative AI interactions in a real-time visual environment
