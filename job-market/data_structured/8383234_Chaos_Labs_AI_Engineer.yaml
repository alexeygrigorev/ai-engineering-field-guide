      This role involves directly building agentic AI systems with
      LLMs, including planning, tool use, and multi-agent
      architectures. The engineer will work hands-on with model
      integration, prompt management, and LLM evaluation - not
      just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build single and multi-agent systems with planning, memory, and tool
    use capabilities
  - Build and operate MCP servers with secure schemas and permissions
  - Develop agentic workflows using LangGraph or equivalent frameworks
  - Integrate LLMs via SDKs and manage prompts, structured outputs, and tool calling
  - Define and run LLM evaluations for quality, correctness, latency, cost, and regressions
  - Build observability and reliability infrastructure including logging, tracing,
    retries, and state management
  - Optimize performance and cost from prototype to production environments
  - Mentor engineers and establish agentic best practices
  use_cases:
  - Transform complex market data into actionable financial insights
  - Build intelligent agents that reason, plan, and execute across financial workflows
  - Secure over $200 billion in assets across DeFi protocols including Aave, Jupiter,
    and GMX
  - Process and analyze more than $5 trillion in transaction volume
  - Provide institutional-grade intelligence for financial markets
  - Deliver risk management systems and oracles for financial protocols
