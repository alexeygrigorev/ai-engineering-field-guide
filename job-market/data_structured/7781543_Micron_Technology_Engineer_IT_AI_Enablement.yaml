    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role is focused on enabling AI adoption across the
      enterprise rather than building or training models directly.
      The engineer works with existing AI platforms (Copilot
      Studio, Azure AI Foundry, AWS Bedrock), integrates AI agents
      with enterprise systems, and creates automation workflows.
      While there are some AI-first elements like RAG and multi-
      agent workflows, the primary focus is on deployment,
      integration, and enablement rather than model development.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and deploy AI-driven tools and workflows using platforms like Copilot Studio,
    UiPath, and other automation frameworks
  - Connect AI agents with enterprise systems including SharePoint, M365, external
    APIs, and knowledge bases for seamless interoperability
  - Identify repetitive tasks and design intelligent automation solutions to improve
    efficiency
  - Partner with cross-functional teams to enable AI literacy, create best-practice
    documentation, and support internal training sessions
  - Collaborate with cybersecurity teams to enforce data protection, threat modeling,
    and ensure AI solutions adhere to security and compliance standards
  - Implement secure agent interactions using encryption, authentication, and authorization
    mechanisms with identity platforms
  - Collect feedback, iterate solutions, and contribute to a culture of innovation
    and scalability
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise AI adoption acceleration across diverse business areas
  - Process automation for repetitive tasks to improve operational efficiency
  - Internal AI enablement and training programs to improve workforce AI literacy
  - Secure AI agent integration with enterprise systems and knowledge bases
  - Multi-agent workflows for complex decision-making and collaborative problem-solving
  - Context-aware AI systems with memory persistence for long-horizon enterprise tasks
