  focus: GPU computing and AI hardware/software platforms
position:
  title: AI Developer Technology Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ml-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on deep learning, GPU optimization, and
      traditional ML workloads rather than LLMs/agents. The
      engineer develops and optimizes ML algorithms on GPU
      architectures and collaborates on next-generation hardware
      design without mention of GenAI technologies like RAG or
      agents.
  responsibilities:
  - Study and develop cutting-edge techniques in deep learning, graphs, machine learning,
    and data analytics
  - Perform in-depth analysis and optimization for best performance on current and
    next-generation GPU architectures
  - Work directly with key customers to understand their problems and provide the
    best AI solutions using GPUs
  - Collaborate closely with architecture, research, libraries, tools, and system
    software teams to influence next-generation designs
  - Influence the design of next-generation architectures, software platforms, and
    programming models
  use_cases:
  - Self-driving cars reducing congestion and improving road safety
  - AI travel agents that understand user preferences and arrange vacations
  - Medical instruments reading and understanding patient DNA for cancer detection
  - GPU deep learning for computers to learn from data and write complex software
