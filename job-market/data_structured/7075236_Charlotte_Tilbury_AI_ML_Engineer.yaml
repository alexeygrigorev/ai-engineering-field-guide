    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on design and implementation of
      agentic systems using RAG, prompt engineering, and
      orchestration with LangChain/LangGraph. The engineer builds,
      deploys, and monitors both GenAI and traditional ML models
      directly in production.
  responsibilities:
  - Partner with stakeholders to scope problems and identify appropriate AI solutions,
    leveraging existing tools or building custom workflows
  - Design and implement agentic systems using RAG, grounding, prompt engineering,
    and orchestration on a GCP-first stack
  - Build and maintain production ML pipelines and services for recommender systems,
    customer segmentation, and marketing optimization
  - Develop APIs and microservices for AI/ML solutions ensuring security, scalability,
    and observability
  - Implement CI/CD for ML services, write infrastructure as code, and monitor model/data
    drift and performance
  - Establish robust guardrails for safe AI usage including prompt security, evaluation
    frameworks, and compliance with privacy regulations
  - Drive best practices, reusable templates, and documentation to scale AI/ML delivery
    across the business
  - Collaborate with data engineers, scientists, product managers, legal, and infosec
    to deliver end-to-end solutions
  use_cases:
  - Agentic AI systems with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for beauty and makeup
    applications
  - Recommender systems for personalized product suggestions
  - Customer segmentation models for targeted marketing campaigns
  - Marketing optimization modules using supervised, unsupervised, and econometric
    modeling
  - AI-powered tools to decode makeup applications and improve customer experience
  - Vector search and retrieval for beauty product discovery
