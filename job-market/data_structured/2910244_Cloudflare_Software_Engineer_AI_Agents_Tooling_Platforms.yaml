  title: Software Engineer , AI Agents Tooling & Platforms
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building foundational tooling and
      platform capabilities that SUPPORT AI agents (like Browser
      Rendering API, agent orchestration primitives, and agent-to-
      agent interaction frameworks), rather than building,
      training, or fine-tuning the AI models themselves. The
      engineer is creating infrastructure and APIs that enable
      others to build and deploy AI agents, which is the
      definition of ai-support work.
  responsibilities:
  - Write design documents outlining strategies to tackle specific technical challenges
  - Ship new features that integrate multiple technologies across the stack
  - Architect and deliver innovative API primitives for AI agent platforms, including
    enhancements to the Cloudflare Browser Rendering API
  - Fix bugs affecting user experience rendering
  - Own code from inception to release delivering solutions at every layer of the
    software stack
  - Participate in on-call rotation to maintain service health and availability if
    applicable
  use_cases:
  - Building platform capabilities that power AI agent orchestration and communication
    at scale
  - Enabling efficient headless browsing for AI agents through Cloudflare Browser
    Rendering API
  - Providing AI auditability and traceability features for website owners
  - Creating frameworks for seamless Agent-to-Agent interactions
  - Empowering software engineers to build, deploy, and manage intelligent agents
    at scale on Cloudflare's global network
