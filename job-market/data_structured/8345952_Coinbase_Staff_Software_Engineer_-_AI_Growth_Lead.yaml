      This role involves hands-on work building AI solutions using
      LLMs and Agentic AI, including designing prototypes, writing
      code for AI agents and custom copilots, and deploying them
      to production. The role requires applying advanced GenAI
      techniques directly to build and iterate on functional AI
      automation solutions, not just supporting others' work.

    prototypes into scalable, secure production-grade AI systems
  - Act as an internal consultant providing expert guidance on AI capabilities, prompt
    engineering best practices, and strategic AI integration into daily operations
  - Drive adoption and enablement by piloting new AI solutions with functional teams,
    gathering feedback, and supporting smooth transitions to ensure demonstrable value
  - Ensure responsible AI by partnering with Security, Legal, and Compliance teams
    to maintain strict security, privacy, and ethical guidelines for AI solutions
  - Measure and communicate impact by defining success metrics, tracking ROI, and
    effectively communicating value delivered by AI initiatives to stakeholders
  use_cases:
  - AI automation for business efficiency gains across non-engineering functions like
    Finance, HR, Legal, Operations, Marketing, and Security
  - Custom AI copilots designed to assist with specific departmental workflows and
    operational tasks
  - Agentic AI solutions that autonomously handle business processes and intelligent
    workflows
  - AI-powered workflow automation to address pain points and streamline operations
    in various business functions
