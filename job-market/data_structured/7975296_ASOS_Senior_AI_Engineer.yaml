      The role involves hands-on work building AI solutions using
      LLMs and generative AI, including prompt engineering, fine-
      tuning pre-trained models, and designing evaluation
      frameworks. This is direct work on AI systems rather than
      supporting infrastructure or platforms for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Designing and developing AI solutions using LLMs and generative AI, optimising
    prompts and workflows for high-quality outputs
  - Building scalable data pipelines and applying advanced data preparation techniques
    to ensure integrity and quality
  - Driving standardisation and reusability of AI workflows, enabling consistency
    across diverse product domains
  - Implementing MLOps principles for AI systems including CI/CD, model registries,
    monitoring, and feature management
  - Partnering with Cloud Infrastructure teams to design secure, cost-efficient environments
    for AI workloads
  - Embedding data ethics principles into AI development, proactively mitigating bias
    and ensuring safe, responsible AI practices
  - Fine-tuning pre-trained models for domain-specific tasks to improve performance
    and relevance
  - Designing and implementing robust evaluation frameworks for AI models, including
    automated testing and benchmarking
  use_cases:
  - Personalised fashion experiences for millions of online retail customers
  - LLM-powered product recommendations and search optimization
  - Generative AI solutions for fashion content creation and styling advice
  - Automated evaluation and monitoring of AI model performance in retail context
  - Ethical AI systems with bias mitigation for fashion recommendations
