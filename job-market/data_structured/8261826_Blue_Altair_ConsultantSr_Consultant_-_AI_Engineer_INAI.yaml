    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is hands-on with AI/ML systems, building and
      deploying GenAI models, LLM applications, and RAG pipelines.
      The engineer directly trains, fine-tunes, and deploys models
      rather than just supporting infrastructure or platforms.
  responsibilities:
  - Research, design, and implement GenAI-powered solutions for complex business problems
  - Build and deploy LLM-based applications including chatbots, copilots, and autonomous
    agents
  - Architect and optimize RAG pipelines for enterprise knowledge retrieval and augmentation
  - Develop and evaluate embedding-based solutions for semantic search, personalization,
    and recommendation
  - Experiment with agentic AI frameworks to design multi-agent workflows and autonomous
    decision-making systems
  - Research machine learning algorithms, develop solution formulations, and test
    on large datasets
  - Design experiments, test hypotheses, and build actionable models
  - Translate unstructured, complex business problems into abstract mathematical frameworks
    to produce working algorithms at scale
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise knowledge retrieval and augmentation using RAG
  - Semantic search and personalization for recommendation systems
  - Chatbots, copilots, and autonomous agents for business automation
  - Unstructured business problem solving with tailored analytic solutions
  - Data-driven insights including trend identification and anomaly detection
