      The role is a Backend Engineer on the Linea AI team focused
      on operationalizing and scaling AI prototypes to production,
      not building or fine-tuning models. The engineer works on

    large graph datasets at enterprise scale in realtime
  - Solve real-world scaling problems requiring thorough performance analysis and
    troubleshooting skills
  - Work with modern microservices-based software stack including Go, Kubernetes,
    Docker, and Redis
  - Write secure-by-design hardened software that withstands real-world attacks while
    processing untrusted data
  - Operationalize and scale AI prototypes to production across many customers
  use_cases:
  - Data security with AI-enabled data lineage
  - Real-time analysis of billions of workflows
  - Data risk detection and threat prevention
