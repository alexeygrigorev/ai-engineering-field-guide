  title: Software Engineer - AI Products
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves building an AI-native platform (Babbix)
      that orchestrates classification pipelines, data extraction
      models, and AI-driven workflows. The engineer will work on
      model orchestration, integrate LLMs and vector databases,
      and deliver new AI capabilities directly, which aligns with
      hands-on AI/ML system development rather than just support
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Build core AI-product features for enterprise brokers and own large new areas
    within the product
  - Drive the development of backend systems including APIs, data pipelines, and model
    orchestration
  - Deliver high-velocity experiments to engage customers and ship new AI-driven capabilities
  - Work across the entire product lifecycle from conceptualization through production
    deployment
  - Contribute to internal tooling, testing infrastructure, and CI/CD to improve velocity
    and reliability
  - Collaborate directly with clients to gather feedback and translate it into product
    improvements and feature priorities
  use_cases:
  - Transform messy email submissions into structured, actionable data with minimal
    friction
  - Help brokers move from inbox to quote-ready submissions in minutes instead of
    hours
  - Orchestrate broker workflows end-to-end using classification pipelines and data
    extraction models
  - Enable rapid iteration on new workflows and AI features across lines of business
    and carriers
  - Make AI output transparent, accurate, and trustworthy for commercial insurance
