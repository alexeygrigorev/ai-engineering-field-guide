  stage: Series B+ (growth stage company with global expansion and massive growth)
  focus: AI guidance platform for insurance claims handling
position:
  title: Senior AI/ML Engineer (LLMs)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves direct hands-on work building, deploying,
      and optimizing LLM-powered features including RAG systems,
      fine-tuning models, and implementing agentic systems. The
      engineer is responsible for end-to-end development from
      ideation to production deployment of AI/ML solutions, which
      is characteristic of ai-first roles.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and deploy AI-powered and LLM-driven features for claim synthesis
    product including robust extraction from medical documents and human-in-the-loop
    summarization workflows
  - Develop and implement hybrid machine learning solutions combining statistical
    models, LLMs, and RAG embeddings-based retrieval techniques to improve accuracy,
    scalability, and robustness
  - Write clean, scalable, and efficient code while optimizing the performance of
    existing AI/ML systems in production
  - Collaborate with data labelers and subject matter experts to rigorously evaluate
    AI system outputs and continuously improve model performance
  - Partner with Product teams to rapidly iterate on feedback and deliver impactful
    features
  - Translate cutting-edge AI/ML research and novel techniques into production-grade,
    reliable, and maintainable solutions for live customer environments
  use_cases:
  - Extract key information from complex medical documents for insurance claims
  - Generate human-in-the-loop summaries for medical claims processing
  - Improve claims handling accuracy and efficiency using hybrid ML approaches
  - Embeddings-based retrieval for medical document search and synthesis
  - Agentic AI systems for autonomous claims processing
  - RAG-powered medical synthesis with domain-specific fine-tuned LLMs
