      This is a hands-on AI engineering role focused on designing
      and implementing LLM solutions, RAG architectures, prompt
      templates, and vector database integrations. The role
      involves direct model development, deployment, and
      productionisation - building AI systems rather than
      supporting infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement robust Machine Learning and AI workflows using orchestration
    tools such as Airflow
  - Ground LLM solutions by integrating appropriate data sources, design and develop
    RAG architectures, and craft effective prompt templates
  - Work with Data Platform Engineering team to build and maintain CI/CD pipelines
    for ML and AI solutions covering model training, evaluation and deployment
  - Design and implement model registries, versioning systems, and experiment tracking
    to ensure full reproducibility of all model releases
  - Build model monitoring solutions tracking performance, drift, accuracy and overall
    solution health
  - Apply constraints to guide model behaviour and validate AI outputs against expected
    results
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise-grade AI solutions for commercial insurance domain
  - LLM-powered applications using RAG architectures and semantic search
  - AI workflows for complex business problem solving in insurance
  - Automated decision-making systems for insurance operations
  - Knowledge retrieval systems using vector databases and semantic search
