      This is a platform engineering role that focuses on building
      infrastructure, frameworks, and deployment platforms for
      ML/AI products. The responsibilities emphasize platform
      work, pipelines, and assisting ML Engineers/Data Scientists
      to deploy their models, rather than building, training, or
      fine-tuning models directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, prototype and productionize scalable AI/machine learning models
  - Develop frameworks, pipelines, libraries, utilities and tools that process massive
    data for ML tasks
  - Partner with ML engineers and data scientists to troubleshoot and optimize complex
    ML pipelines
  - Build model deployment platform that can simplify implementing new models
  - Build end-to-end reusable pipelines from data acquisition to model output delivery
  - Mentor and guide junior data scientists to deploy their models into production
  use_cases:
  - Productionizing and scaling AI/ML products for mental health services
  - Building deployment platforms for machine learning models in therapy applications
  - Creating reusable data pipelines for ML model training and inference
  - Enabling ML engineering capabilities for therapy service optimization
