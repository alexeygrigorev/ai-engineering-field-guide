  title: AI Engineer (GenAI – Vertex AI & GCP)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves direct hands-on work building and
      deploying Generative AI solutions including LLM
      applications, RAG pipelines, fine-tuning foundation models,
      and prompt engineering. The engineer will work directly on
      AI systems using Vertex AI, not just supporting
      infrastructure or data pipelines for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and develop Generative AI applications using Vertex AI on GCP
  - Build and deploy LLM-powered use cases such as chatbots, summarization, and document
    intelligence
  - Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines using Vector Databases
    and embeddings
  - Manage token usage, prompt engineering, and context optimization for LLM applications
  - Develop backend services and APIs to integrate AI capabilities into products
  - Fine-tune and evaluate foundation models where required
  - Monitor, optimize, and scale AI workloads on GCP
  - Collaborate with data scientists, product teams, and DevOps for production deployment
  use_cases:
  - Chatbots and conversational AI applications
  - Document summarization and intelligence
  - Enterprise document search and retrieval
  - LLM-powered content generation
  - RAG-based knowledge management systems
  - AI-powered customer support and assistance
