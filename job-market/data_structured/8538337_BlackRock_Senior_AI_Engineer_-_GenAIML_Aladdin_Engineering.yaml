    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on building of AI systems including
      LLM agents, RAG systems, and vector search implementations.
      The engineer is directly designing and deploying GenAI
      solutions, not just supporting infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and develop production AI services that embed GenAI and ML into enterprise
    workflows
  - Build AI agents that can plan and execute multi-step tasks by calling approved
    tools/APIs, retrieving context, validating outputs, and safely handling failure
    cases
  - Implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using vector search and
    hybrid retrieval to ground responses in enterprise data and documentation
  - Develop ML components for classification, ranking, and anomaly detection and integrate
    them with LLM-based systems for hybrid intelligence
  - Establish robust evaluation and quality gates for agents and LLM systems including
    golden datasets, automated tests, regression suites, and monitoring for drift/quality
  - Implement enterprise-grade governance including audit trails, provenance/citations,
    access control, privacy handling, and versioning
  - Champion best practices for code quality, testing, automation, and performance/cost
    optimization
  - Mentor engineers to elevate technical craftsmanship, problem-solving, and design
    thinking
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise workflow automation using AI agents
  - Knowledge retrieval and document search using RAG
  - Post-trade accounting operations automation
  - Operational efficiency improvements in financial systems
  - Anomaly detection and classification in financial data
  - User experience enhancement through AI-powered insights
