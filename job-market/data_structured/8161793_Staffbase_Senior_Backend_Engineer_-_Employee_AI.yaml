  title: Senior Backend Engineer - Employee AI
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a backend engineering role focused on building
      infrastructure and services that power AI applications. The
      engineer works ON prompt engineering, model integration, and
      implementing multi-agent architectures (A2A protocols, MCP
      servers) rather than training or fine-tuning models
      themselves. While hands-on with AI systems, the work centers
      on orchestration, observability, and production deployment
      of AI capabilities built by others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and maintain scalable and fault-tolerant backend services that
    power AI applications
  - Apply advanced prompt engineering techniques to optimize model performance, manage
    context windows, and ensure high-quality responses
  - Implement model integration patterns to connect and orchestrate various external
    and internal services
  - Develop Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol communication strategies for complex multi-agent
    architectures
  - Implement systems for Managing Conversational Protocols (MCP servers) and A2A
    protocol for long-running, stateful interactions
  - Define and implement observability standards for AI applications including metrics
    for latency, cost, token usage, drift, and user-perceived quality
  - Collaborate with ML Scientists and Data Scientists to transition prototypes and
    models into production-ready, high-availability services
  - Mentor junior engineers and champion best practices in backend development and
    MLOps
  use_cases:
  - Agentic AI communications channels including intranet, employee app, and email
    solutions
  - Multi-agent architectures for complex conversational workflows
  - Employee experience platform using AI-native communication tools
  - Long-running, stateful conversational interactions for workplace communication
  - AI-powered solutions empowering communicators and frontline workers
  - Employee engagement and communication through inspirational AI-driven experiences
