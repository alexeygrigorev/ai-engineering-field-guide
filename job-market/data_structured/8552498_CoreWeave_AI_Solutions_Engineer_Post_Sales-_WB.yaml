    reasoning: |-
      This is a post-sales solutions engineer role focused on
      helping customers implement and scale ML/GenAI workflows
      using Weights & Biases platform. While the role requires
      deep knowledge of ML/LLM systems, the engineer is enabling
      customers to build these systems rather than building AI
      systems directly - they are providing technical guidance,
      best practices, and platform expertise. The role is about
      enabling AI work for others, which makes it ai-support.
  responsibilities:
  - Help customers implement and scale ML pipelines and agentic workflows using Weights
    & Biases
  - Collaborate with engineering teams to ensure smooth onboarding and adoption of
    the platform
  - Act as a trusted advisor on best practices for ML and GenAI workflows across industries
  - Partner with leading AI teams to optimize workflows and share technical expertise
  - Represent the voice of the customer internally to influence the product roadmap
  - Lead technical success initiatives post-sales, partnering with Sales, Support,
    Product, and Engineering teams
  use_cases:
  - Computer vision model development and deployment
  - Robotics applications with ML workflows
  - Natural language processing and large language model implementations
  - ML pipeline optimization and scaling at production level
  - Experiment tracking and observability for deep learning models
  - Agentic AI workflow implementation and deployment
