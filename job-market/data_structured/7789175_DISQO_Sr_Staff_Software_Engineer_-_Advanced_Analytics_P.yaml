      The role explicitly involves building an Agentic AI system
      that leverages AI to drive autonomous, intelligent decision-
      making and autonomously explore data to surface insights.
      The engineer will architect and build this next-generation
      AI analytics engine from the ground up, working hands-on
      with AI technologies rather than just supporting AI
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and deliver a high-performance Advanced Analytics Engine featuring vectorized
    query processing, columnar storage, and OLAP capabilities
  - Design and build an Agentic AI system that leverages the Advanced Analytics Engine
    to drive autonomous, intelligent decision-making
  - Partner with product, engineering, and data teams to power agentic AI analytics
    systems that autonomously explore data and surface actionable insights
  - Profile, benchmark, and optimize Rust components for maximum throughput, low latency,
    and hardware-aware efficiency
  - Leverage AWS cloud services to architect scalable, reliable, and cost-efficient
    analytics infrastructure
  - Shape the evolution of DISQO's broader data platform and integration across the
    product ecosystem
  - Mentor and guide engineers, fostering a culture of technical excellence, innovation,
    and collaboration
  - Contribute to open-source or internal frameworks that advance analytical systems
    and distributed computation
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered analytics system for intuitive and instant data exploration
  - Autonomous data exploration and insight generation using agentic AI
  - High-performance marketing analytics with sub-second query performance
  - Advertising performance measurement and consumer behavior analysis
  - Large-scale data processing at billions of data points for marketing datasets
  - Intelligent decision-making system for brands, agencies, and media companies
