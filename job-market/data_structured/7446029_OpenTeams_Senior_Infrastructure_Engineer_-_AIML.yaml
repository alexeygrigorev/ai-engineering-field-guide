position:
  title: Senior Infrastructure Engineer - AI/ML
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is an infrastructure engineering role focused on
      building and maintaining the platform that supports AI/ML
      workflows, not directly building, training, or fine-tuning
      models. The role involves designing infrastructure
      components for model training, serving, and data pipelines
      using Kubernetes, Terraform, and MLOps tools, which are
      enabling technologies for the ML engineers who work on the
      models themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Significantly contribute to the evolution of Nebari and design reusable, modular
    infrastructure components for Kubernetes-based sovereign AI deployments
  - Develop composable MLOps components and infrastructure patterns supporting model
    training, serving, monitoring, and CI/CD pipelines
  - Design and implement observability, monitoring, and cost optimization strategies
    for large-scale AI/ML workloads on client-owned Kubernetes infrastructure
  - Collaborate with ML engineers to optimize infrastructure for training ML models,
    quantizing and packaging open weight LLMs, computer vision workloads, and other
    AI applications in sovereign environments
  - Contribute to open-source MLOps tooling and Kubernetes ecosystem projects that
    enable data sovereignty
  - Work with clients to deploy, configure, and optimize their sovereign AI infrastructure
  use_cases:
  - Sovereign AI infrastructure that organizations own and operate with complete control
    over their data and AI systems
  - Model training and inference serving for LLMs and computer vision workloads in
    air-gapped or highly secure environments
  - Large-scale AI/ML workloads with emphasis on data sovereignty, privacy, and security
    requirements
  - Energy-efficient and cost-effective AI deployments using open-source technologies
