      This is a hands-on engineering role focused on building
      cloud-native agentic AI applications with direct work on
      LLMs, RAG, MCP, and agent workflows. The responsibilities
      explicitly include fine-tuning, evaluating, and deploying
      large language models, which are core ai-first activities.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the design and delivery of cloud-native Agentic AI applications that are
    resilient, performant, and can scale well in production
  - Fine-tune, evaluate, and deploy large language models in production environments
  - Establish and implement evaluation and observability standards including regression
    tests, monitoring, and feedback loops
  - Design frameworks and tools that make it easier for other teams to develop AI-powered
    experiences
  - Establish best practices for Agentic experimentation, evaluation, and optimization
    in high throughput environments
  - Partner with product managers, architects, developers, and data scientists to
    bring AI features to life in Autodesk products
  use_cases:
  - Product Data Management (PDM) workflow automation
  - Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) workflow automation
  - Enterprise search using RAG architectures
  - Agentic AI systems for CAD and manufacturing domains
  - Cloud-native AI agents for engineering workflows
