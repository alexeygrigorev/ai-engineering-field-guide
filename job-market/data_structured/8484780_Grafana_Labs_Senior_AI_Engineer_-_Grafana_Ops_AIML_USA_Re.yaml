    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work building AI solutions with
      LLMs and AI agents for incident management and
      observability. The engineer will prototype, test, and ship
      LLM-powered workflows and agent-based features, which is
      direct work on AI systems rather than supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and deliver high-performance AI features for incident detection, triage,
    and resolution using observability data
  - Implement rapid prototyping and iteration of LLM- or agent-powered workflows for
    incident lifecycle management
  - Collaborate cross-functionally with data analysts, product managers, and designers
    to shape AI-driven product features
  - Integrate agentic components with internal tools, alerting systems, runbooks,
    and developer workflows
  - Take full ownership of AI solutions ensuring they are scalable, maintainable,
    and aligned with real user workflows
  - Utilize AI and automation tools to enhance product functionality and development
    workflows
  use_cases:
  - Automated incident detection and triage using observability data
  - AI-powered incident response and automated analysis tasks
  - AI agents for incident lifecycle management across the observability stack
  - Integration of agentic components with alerting systems and runbooks
  - Reduction of toil and domain expertise barriers through AI-driven automation
