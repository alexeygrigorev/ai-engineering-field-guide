    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves working directly on Large Quantitative
      Models (LQMs) and agentic frameworks, including model
      development, training, fine-tuning, and production
      deployment. The engineer owns the entire ML lifecycle and
      actively builds AI-first SaaS products rather than just
      supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, construct, and manage robust data pipelines for the training, validation,
    and continuous retraining of Large Quantitative Models and agentic frameworks
  - Develop, implement, and rigorously test novel ML models and algorithms, defining
    appropriate metrics to ensure model performance aligns with high-level product
    objectives
  - Lead the effort in cleaning, transforming, and engineering features from complex
    and large-scale datasets to optimize LQM performance and predictive accuracy
  - Conduct deep analysis of model behavior, performance, and failure modes, tuning
    hyper-parameters and optimizing model architecture for efficiency, speed, and
    accuracy in a production context
  - Collaborate closely with AI researchers, product managers, and SWEs to translate
    high-level business objectives into actionable ML development and deployment roadmaps
  - Champion and enforce exceptional engineering standards for code quality, system
    efficiency, and security in a prototyping environment
  - Drive technical execution with high autonomy, making critical design and implementation
    decisions independently
  use_cases:
  - Life sciences applications powered by Large Quantitative Models
  - Financial services solutions including risk simulation and technical analysis
  - Navigation systems enhanced by AI and quantitative modeling
  - Cybersecurity applications leveraging advanced AI frameworks
  - AI-first SaaS products across multiple industry sectors
