    reasoning: |-
      This role is focused on data infrastructure, pipelines, and
      platform engineering rather than building, training, or
      deploying AI/ML models. While the role mentions MLFlow and
      Databricks, these are used for platform/mlops infrastructure
      support rather than hands-on model development. The role is
      clearly about architecting data solutions, building data
      pipelines, and supporting analytics workflows for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the architecture, design, and development of sophisticated, highly scalable
    data pipelines leveraging tools such as Fivetran, dbt, AWS Glue, Airflow, custom
    Python applications, Snowflake, Databricks, and cloud storage solutions
  - Provide technical leadership in integrating and transforming complex data sets
    from diverse sources including AuroraDB, Snowflake, Postgres, MySQL, and DynamoDB
  - Drive collaboration with analytics, engineering, and commercial stakeholders to
    design and refine data models and marts that empower high-impact decision-making
  - Champion and implement rigorous data quality, validation, observability, and reliability
    standards across data workflows
  - Mentor and upskill team members, influencing the development of Guild's data engineering
    practices and standards
  - Serve as a trusted advisor, guiding enterprise-wide data strategy, prototyping
    key data initiatives, and ensuring alignment of data engineering practices with
    long-term business and technical objectives
