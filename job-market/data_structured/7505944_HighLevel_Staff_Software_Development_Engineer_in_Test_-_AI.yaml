      This is a Staff SDET role focused on testing and quality

      deploying models.

  - Define overall QA strategy and architect large-scale, reusable, cross-platform
    automation frameworks
  - Drive organisation-wide quality initiatives and own the quality charter for the
    AI vertical
  - Design scalable test approaches for RAG, hallucination, drift, and bias
  - Own decisions on test strategy, tools, frameworks, and AI testing methodologies
  - Coach and up-skill the entire team, set best practices, and build talent pipeline
  - Influence cross-functional teams, participate in architecture discussions, and
    align testing with business strategy
  - Shape AI quality roadmap, reduce organisation-wide risk, and improve scalability
    and reliability
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered sales and marketing platform for agencies and businesses
  - Lead capture, nurturing, and customer conversion automation
  - Messaging and communication handling (2.5 billion message events daily)
  - AI-driven customer engagement and conversation facilitation
