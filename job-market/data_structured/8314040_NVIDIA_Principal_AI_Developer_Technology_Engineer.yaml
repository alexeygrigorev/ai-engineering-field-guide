    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves GPU acceleration and optimization of
      AI/deep learning workloads, including models from NLP, CV,
      and recommender systems. The engineer works directly on
      parallel algorithms for AI applications and performs low-
      level performance optimizations on AI workloads, which is
      hands-on work with AI systems rather than supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Research and develop techniques to GPU accelerate workloads in deep learning,
    machine learning and other AI domains
  - Perform in-depth analysis and optimization of complex AI and HPC algorithms for
    optimal performance on modern CPU and GPU architectures
  - Publish and present optimization techniques in developer blogs or conferences
    to educate the developer community
  - Influence the design of next-generation hardware architectures, software, and
    programming models through collaboration with NVIDIA teams
  use_cases:
  - GPU acceleration of deep learning models including NLP, Computer Vision, and Recommender
    Systems
  - Optimization of AI workloads on advanced CPU and GPU architectures
  - Parallel algorithm implementation for machine learning and deep learning applications
  - Performance optimization of complex AI and HPC algorithms
  - Real-time, cost-effective computing platform for AI workloads
