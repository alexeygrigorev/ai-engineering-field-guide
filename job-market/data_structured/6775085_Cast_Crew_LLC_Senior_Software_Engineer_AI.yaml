    trends, labor forecasts, and compliance risks
  - Build scalable backend services in Python, TypeScript, and Node.js integrating
    with LLMs, vector stores, and analytics engines
  - Use Model Context Protocol (MCP) to manage and preserve context across chat, prediction,
    and recommendation workflows
  - Leverage cloud-native AWS tools (Lambda, SageMaker, Bedrock, DynamoDB) to deploy
    and scale AI features
  - Evaluate emerging AI tools, LLM frameworks, and APIs to advance the product's
    intelligence capabilities
