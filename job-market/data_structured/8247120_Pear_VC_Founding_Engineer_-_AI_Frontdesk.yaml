    AI-powered SMB customer revenue platform with AI agents for

position:
  title: Founding Engineer - AI Frontdesk
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a full-stack founding engineer role at an AI
      company, but the responsibilities focus on building the
      application infrastructure, internal tools, and customer-
      facing features rather than working directly on AI models.
      The AI layer appears to be pre-built or integrated via APIs
      (Twilio, LiveKit), with the engineer's role being to patch
      AI logic and build around it rather than build/train/fine-
      tune models themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Ship revenue-generating features used by hundreds of SMBs from prototype to production
  - Work across the full technology stack including TypeScript, React, FastAPI, Postgres,
    Twilio, and LiveKit
  - Patch and debug critical AI logic that impacts call quality and customer experience
  - Build internal tools and systems that accelerate go-to-market speed and operations
  - Engage directly with customers through sales calls, support interactions, and
    product demos
  - Own large product surface areas including lead capture workflows, analytics, and
    integrations
  - Architect key system components and shape engineering culture as the team scales
  use_cases:
  - AI receptionists handling customer conversations for SMBs
  - AI agents managing all customer interactions from acquisition to retention
  - Intelligence layer learning from every customer interaction to improve outcomes
  - Outbound AI driving real revenue growth for small businesses
  - Unified SMB platform managing customer operations end-to-end
