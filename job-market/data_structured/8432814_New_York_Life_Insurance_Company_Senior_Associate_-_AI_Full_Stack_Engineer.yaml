    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work building AI systems
      including RAG architectures, AI agents with autonomous
      reasoning, and multi-agent orchestration frameworks. The
      engineer directly designs, implements, and deploys AI/ML
      models and agentic AI systems, not just supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement end-to-end AI-powered applications, from data pipelines and
    ML models to APIs and user interfaces
  - Build and optimize RAG systems leveraging embeddings, vector databases, and document
    pipelines
  - Develop AI agents with autonomous reasoning, multi-step task execution, and external
    tool/API integration
  - Implement Agentic AI protocols including Model Context Protocol (MCP) and multi-agent
    orchestration frameworks
  - Build scalable frontend applications using React, Angular, or Vue, and backend
    services with Python, Node.js, Java, or Go
  - Deploy, monitor, and scale applications on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) with
    Docker and Kubernetes
  - Ensure system reliability through monitoring, observability, drift detection,
    and alerting for ML models in production
  - Mentor junior developers and contribute to a culture of engineering excellence
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise search and document retrieval using RAG architectures
  - Autonomous AI agents for business workflow automation
  - AI-powered applications embedding intelligence into insurance business processes
  - Multi-agent systems for complex task orchestration and execution
  - Real-time AI systems with low-latency inference for customer-facing applications
