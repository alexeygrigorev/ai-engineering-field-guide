  title: Senior AI Product Engineer, Fullstack
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a fullstack engineer role building the observability
      platform and tools that enable AI engineers to monitor,
      troubleshoot, and optimize their AI/ML systems. While the
      role contributes to in-house AI agents and requires
      understanding of LLM workflows, the primary focus is
      building the infrastructure, APIs, and visualization
      interfaces that support AI work rather than directly
      building, training, or deploying production models.
  responsibilities:
  - Write maintainable, scalable, and performant code across the stack primarily in
    Typescript and React with opportunities to work in Python and Go
  - Design and build APIs, and domain / object models specific to customers' Machine
    Learning and LLM workflows
  - Design and build performant and reusable React components used throughout the
    application
  - Research and implement cutting-edge visualization & dimensionality reduction algorithms
    in a distributed environment
  - Collaborate with product, design, and customer engineering teams to enhance and
    expand product offerings
  - Contribute to building in-house AI Agents and lead architectural decisions for
    new and existing features
  use_cases:
  - AI observability and monitoring platform for tracking model performance in production
  - Interactive playgrounds for prompt engineering and agent development workflows
  - Real-time evaluation infrastructure handling millions of annotations per second
  - Data visualization tools for interpreting and monitoring AI/ML model behavior
  - Instrumentation APIs for automatically tracking LLM and agent applications
