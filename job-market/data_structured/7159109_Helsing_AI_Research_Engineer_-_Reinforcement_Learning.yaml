  title: AI Research Engineer - Reinforcement Learning
  ai_type:
    type: ml-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is building and training reinforcement learning
      agents for autonomous aerial platforms, working directly on
      RL algorithms, multi-agent systems, and model training.
      While not explicitly GenAI/LLM focused, it's hands-on ML
      model development and deployment in a production system, not
      supporting AI work for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Build, train and integrate reinforcement learning agents into high-performance
    runtime systems for real-time autonomous decision-making in flight
  - Implement, improve and extend state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning
    methods
  - Develop the autonomy brain for the CA-1 Europa Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle
    (UCAV) as part of the Centaur project
  - Collaborate across multiple teams to integrate cutting-edge ML/AI capabilities
    into production systems
  - Reimplement and extend state-of-the-art Deep Learning research approaches
  - Deploy AI software to production including testing, quality assurance, and monitoring
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous aerial combat vehicle (UCAV) flight control and navigation
  - Real-time decision-making for unmanned aerial platforms in defense scenarios
  - Multi-agent coordination and control for autonomous systems
  - Robust autonomous navigation and localization for semi-autonomous platforms
  - Adversarial attack resilience for deployed autonomous systems
