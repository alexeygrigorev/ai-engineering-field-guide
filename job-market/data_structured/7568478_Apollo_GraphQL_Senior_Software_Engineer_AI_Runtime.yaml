position:
  title: Senior Software Engineer, AI Runtime
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building infrastructure and runtime
      systems that SUPPORT AI/agent workflows, not building models
      or agents themselves. The engineer works on MCP
      Server/Gateway which provides routing, orchestration, and
      tool integration layers for AI agents to use, but does not
      involve training, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models.
  responsibilities:
  - Scale an enterprise AI/MCP Server and Gateway that powers multi-agent workflows
    across Apollo, including routing, orchestration, and integration boundaries
  - Implement robust server infrastructure to ensure reliability, performance, and
    security at scale
  - Build and maintain tools for agent discovery, communication, and coordination
  - Define deployment strategies and runtime optimizations to maximize efficiency
    and minimize operational overhead
  - Develop frameworks and patterns that enable seamless multi-agent collaboration
    and AI-driven orchestration
  - Integrate observability, logging, and monitoring for full visibility into server
    and agent behavior
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise-grade MCP Server exposing diverse tools and systems to AI agents effortlessly
  - MCP Gateway routing layer for agentic workflows with policy enforcement and request
    routing
  - Multi-agent systems with tool discovery, invocation, and orchestration across
    diverse environments
  - AI-enhanced developer workflows optimized for orchestration and agent interactions
  - AI-driven routing strategies for context retrieval optimization, cost reduction,
    and improved decision accuracy
