    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is an infrastructure engineering role focused on
      building the platform, tooling, and observability systems
      that enable the deployment of Agentic workflows. The role
      involves multi-cloud architecture, compliance, IaC, and
      developer efficiency - supporting AI work rather than
      building, training, or fine-tuning models directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Define architectural patterns for multi-cloud infrastructure to support secure,
    reliable, and scalable Agentic workflows for enterprise customers
  - Lead the infrastructure roadmap with focus on compliance, privacy, security standards,
    and data isolation strategies
  - Own development and maintenance of Agentic observability platform including logging,
    metrics, tracing, and analytics
  - Drive developer efficiency by building automated tooling and championing Infrastructure-as-Code
    paradigms
  - Solve engineering problems related to multi-tenancy, data isolation, and high-performance
    inference at massive scale
  use_cases:
  - Knowledge retrieval APIs enabling enterprise customers to build powerful Agentic
    workflows
  - Inference APIs for deploying AI agents in regulated industries like healthcare,
    telecom, finance, and retail
  - Evaluation APIs for overseeing and monitoring AI application performance and reliability
  - Multi-tenant AI platform supporting highly regulated enterprise customers with
    strict compliance requirements
  - Enterprise-grade agentic workflows requiring data isolation, security, and VPC-specific
    deployments
