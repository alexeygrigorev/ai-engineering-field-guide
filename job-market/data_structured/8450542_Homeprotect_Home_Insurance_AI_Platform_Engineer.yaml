  title: AI Platform Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work building and deploying AI
      agents for claims handling, implementing RAG pipelines, and
      working directly with LLMs and embeddings. This is direct
      AI/ML development work rather than support infrastructure or
      general software engineering.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build and operate AI-first products that deliver measurable value, shaping
    roadmaps with the Head of AI and AI Product Manager
  - Develop and deploy production-grade AI agents for end-to-end claims handling on
    GCP using Google's ADK and integrate with policy/claims/CRM systems
  - Create and run agent evaluation and monitoring including offline/online tests,
    accuracy/completeness/safety metrics, A/B experiments, and cost/latency dashboards
  - Integrate AI agent functionality with applications via MCP servers and build tools
    for reliable application integration
  - Build robust RAG pipelines and ingestion including text normalisation, chunking,
    metadata/ACL propagation, and vector search in GCP
  - Embed security and compliance including GDPR, PII redaction, secrets management,
    RBAC/IAM, and audit trails while supporting go-live and BAU
  use_cases:
  - End-to-end automated claims handling using AI agents
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for policy and claims knowledge access
  - Integration of AI agents with existing insurance systems (policy, claims, CRM)
  - Document processing and ingestion for insurance workflows
  - Real-time AI-powered customer interactions for insurance queries
