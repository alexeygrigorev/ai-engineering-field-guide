      The role involves direct hands-on work building,
      architecting, and deploying AI systems including RAG
      systems, multi-agent architectures, LLM fine-tuning, and
      LLM-powered applications. This is core AI/ML development
      work, not infrastructure or support.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the design and implementation of production-ready RAG systems integrating
    with Django, Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Clickhouse
  - Architect multi-agent AI systems that operate within platform constraints and
    deliver business value
  - Design and implement sophisticated vector search solutions, including graph-based
    RAG systems
  - Architect and build highly scalable LLM-powered systems for enterprise-level workloads
  - Lead LLM fine-tuning initiatives using RLHF, PEFT, and LoRA for specific business
    domains
  - Optimize LLM performance, cost, and reliability in production environments with
    caching and vector store optimizations
  - Establish MLOps best practices using Langfuse or LiteLLM for model monitoring
    and evaluation
  - Mentor junior engineers in AI/ML best practices and provide technical direction
    for AI initiatives
