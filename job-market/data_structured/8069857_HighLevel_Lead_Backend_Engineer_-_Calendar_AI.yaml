    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves directly building AI systems including
      LLM-powered assistants, RAG pipelines, embeddings, and LLM
      orchestration workflows. The engineer is responsible for
      designing and implementing models, fine-tuning, and
      inference optimization - all hands-on work with AI/ML
      systems rather than just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement LLM-powered onboarding assistants using Google/OpenAI/Anthropic
    models with deterministic orchestration
  - Build RAG workflows using vector databases to inject contextual booking data into
    model prompts
  - Develop AI-driven configuration engines that translate natural language into structured
    booking primitives
  - Design optimization models for resource utilization, workload distribution, capacity
    forecasting, and conflict reduction
  - Build scheduling-aware reasoning modules that handle constraints, buffers, lead
    times, resource availability, and business rules
  - Create scalable data pipelines for embeddings generation, context indexing, and
    model fine-tuning/hybrid retrieval
  - Implement latency-optimized inference orchestration with streaming responses,
    caching, and hybrid decision engines
  - Lead and mentor the engineering team, enforce architectural standards, and drive
    long-term AI roadmap
  use_cases:
  - AI-first scheduling and booking intelligence layer
  - LLM-powered onboarding and configuration assistance for booking systems
  - Natural language to structured booking primitives conversion
  - Resource optimization and capacity forecasting for scheduling
  - Conflict reduction and workload distribution for bookings
