    quality, and support problem-solving across the development lifecycle
  - Use AI tools to assist in code refactoring, debugging, test case generation, and
    documentation
  - Manage code using GitHub, including versioning, pull requests, and code reviews
  - Identify performance bottlenecks and reliability issues, using AI-driven insights
    to optimize applications
  - Design, develop, and maintain scalable web applications using React.js on the
    frontend and Node.js/Express.js on the backend
  - Build reusable, responsive UI components using React, Tailwind CSS, and modern
    component libraries
  - Develop, integrate, and optimize RESTful APIs, ensuring performance, scalability,
    and security best practices
  - Work closely with product, design, and QA teams in an agile environment
