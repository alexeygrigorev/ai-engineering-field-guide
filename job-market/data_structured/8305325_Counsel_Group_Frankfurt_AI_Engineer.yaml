      The role involves designing and training traditional ML
      models for banking use cases (fraud detection, scoring, NLP)
      and building end-to-end ML pipelines. While it mentions MCP
      adoption, the core work focuses on ML model development and
      deployment rather than LLMs/agents or generative AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and train AI/ML models for banking use cases including fraud detection,
    scoring, NLP, and automation
  - Build and maintain ML pipelines using Python, Spark, Trino, and Kafka
  - Deploy ML models into production via microservices using Spring Boot or Python-based
    APIs
  - Integrate AI solutions into the On-Premise Openshift ecosystem and optimize model
    performance
  - Conduct performance testing with JMeter and monitor systems with Dynatrace
  - Support the introduction of cloud-based AI platforms including Azure ML, Vertex
    AI, and AWS SageMaker
  use_cases:
  - Fraud detection systems for banking transactions
  - Credit scoring and risk assessment models
  - NLP-based automation for banking processes
  - General banking process automation and optimization
