  title: Generative AI / Machine Learning Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ml-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role focuses on video machine learning, image embedding,
      and computer vision with PyTorch as the core ML framework.
      While there's a mention of "bonus" generative AI experience
      and agentic systems, the primary technical requirements are
      traditional ML skills - 4+ years of video ML, CV, and
      feature extraction rather than building or deploying
      LLMs/agents.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and implement video machine learning models with focus on image embedding
    and computer vision
  - Build agents capable of deep spatial and temporal reasoning for gaming environments
  - Design and deploy world models that provide training environments for agents
  - Implement video understanding systems with transfer learning capabilities beyond
    games
  - Optimize code performance for high-throughput video inference and feature extraction
  - Drive feature development through A/B testing and usage metrics analysis
  - Own end-to-end quality of complex features from development to production
  use_cases:
  - Understanding and analyzing billions of gameplay clips from gaming moments
  - Building agentic systems that can perceive, anticipate, and improvise in game
    environments
  - Creating world models for training AI agents across diverse gaming environments
  - Performing spatial and temporal reasoning on video content from gameplay
  - Transferring video understanding capabilities from games to other domains
  - Extracting features and insights from high-throughput video data
