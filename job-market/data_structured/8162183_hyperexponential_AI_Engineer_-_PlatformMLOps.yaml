    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role is an AI Platform/MLOps position focused on
      building infrastructure and tooling for other teams to
      deploy and operate AI systems. The engineer creates shared
      services (LLM gateway, evaluation frameworks, monitoring)
      and self-service tools but does not build, train, or fine-
      tune models themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and operate scalable AI infrastructure for LLM inference, prompt management,
    and evaluation pipelines supporting billions in premium flow
  - Build self-service tools, SDKs, and APIs that enable product teams to move from
    prototype to production faster
  - Instrument production AI/ML workloads with standardized logging, tracing, and
    evaluation metrics for full observability coverage
  - Implement intelligent routing, caching, and provider optimization via LLM gateway
    to reduce AI compute costs
  - Drive adoption of shared platform services including LLM gateway, evaluation frameworks,
    and monitoring across AI features
  - Champion developer experience through comprehensive documentation and responsive
    support for internal customers
  use_cases:
  - Domain-specific AI peer programmer for actuaries and underwriters (similar to
    GitHub Copilot with actuarial science expertise)
  - Large-scale document intelligence for insurance submission and decision processing
  - Agentic workflows that automate insurance industry operations
  - AI-powered pricing decisions determining which risks to take and how to price
    them
  - Real-time underwriting decision support for complex risk assessment
