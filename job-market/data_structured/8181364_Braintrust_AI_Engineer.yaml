      This is a forward deployed engineering role working directly
      on AI systems with customers. The role involves deploying
      and improving AI applications, instrumenting AI workflows,
      working with LLMs and agentic workflows in production, and
      implementing evaluations and CI quality gates - all hands-on
      work with models and AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Partner closely with customer engineering teams to deploy, stabilize, and continuously
    improve AI applications in production
  - Instrument and trace real-world AI workflows end-to-end, establishing baseline
    targets for latency, cost, quality, and reliability
  - Turn production data into datasets and evaluations; define scoring rubrics and
    implement CI quality gates
  - Build prototypes, integrations, and custom workflows that help customers operationalize
    evaluations and observability as part of their SDLC
  - Deploy and troubleshoot Braintrust in customer environments (cloud or self-hosted),
    working across application, data, and infrastructure layers
  - Act as the technical lead in customer engagements, running an operating cadence
    and feeding real-world learnings back into Product and Engineering
  use_cases:
  - AI observability and monitoring in production environments
  - Model comparison and prompt testing for AI applications
  - Regression detection and quality evaluation for LLM systems
  - End-to-end AI workflow instrumentation and tracing
  - Operationalizing AI evaluations as part of software development lifecycle
  - Production data analysis for continuous AI system improvement
