      This role involves hands-on work with LLMs, fine-tuning
      models, deploying AI systems, and building NLP pipelines for
      intelligent test generation and anomaly detection. The
      responsibilities directly include fine-tuning and deploying
      LLMs, maintaining model performance, and developing AI-
      driven components, which aligns with building and optimizing
      AI systems rather than just supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement AI-driven components that support quality engineering across
    the SDLC
  - Develop NLP pipelines to extract insights from requirements, user feedback, and
    test artifacts
  - Fine-tune and deploy LLMs to support intelligent test generation, summarization,
    and anomaly detection
  - Collaborate with QA, DevOps and Product teams to integrate AI tooling into CI/CD
    pipelines and quality gates
  - Analyze historical test and defect data to identify patterns and optimize regression
    test coverage
  - Maintain and improve model performance through continuous learning and feedback
    loops
  use_cases:
  - Intelligent test generation using LLMs
  - Test case summarization and documentation
  - Anomaly detection in test artifacts and systems
  - Pattern identification from historical test and defect data
  - Automated insight extraction from requirements and user feedback
  - Optimization of regression test coverage through ML-based analysis
