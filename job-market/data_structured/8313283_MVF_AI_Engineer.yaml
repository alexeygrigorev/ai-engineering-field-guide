    Building AI agents for business operations and customer

position:
  title: AI Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is building AI agents that actively perform
      actions (function calls, multi-step workflows) and implement
      production-grade RAG systems. The role directly involves
      designing, building, and deploying GenAI systems including
      prompt engineering, evaluation frameworks, and orchestration
      of language models.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and engineer AI agents that perform deterministic actions based on probabilistic
    reasoning and manage multi-step workflows
  - Implement production-grade RAG with hybrid search, re-ranking strategies, and
    metadata filtering
  - Build pipelines for structured data extraction from unstructured conversations
  - Implement observability tools and tracing systems to monitor agent decision-making
    and execution chains
  - Create automated evaluation pipelines with golden datasets to test prompts and
    ensure deployment confidence
  - Monitor and optimize token usage, inference latency, and the trade-off between
    model intelligence and cost
  - Collaborate with the Head of Data to define technical roadmap and architectural
    standards
  - Establish shared deployment patterns, monitoring standards, and security practices
    with the Data Science team
  use_cases:
  - AI agents that autonomously optimize business operations and deliver better outcomes
    for customers
  - Multi-step agentic workflows that execute function calls and manage state across
    complex tasks
  - RAG systems that provide agents with exact context for decision-making through
    hybrid search
  - Structured data extraction from unstructured conversations for downstream system
    consumption
  - Automated prompt evaluation and testing to ensure reliable agent performance in
    production
