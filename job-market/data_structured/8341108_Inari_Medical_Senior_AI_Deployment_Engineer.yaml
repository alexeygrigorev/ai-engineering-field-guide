  focus: Medical device technology for surgery and intervention
position:
  title: Senior AI Deployment Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is a hands-on AI deployment role involving direct work
      with models including optimization for real-time inference,
      deploying LLMs and GenAI features, and implementing multi-
      agentic AI frameworks. The engineer builds, optimizes, and
      deploys AI systems (CV, multimodal, LLMs) across cloud and
      edge platforms, which qualifies as ai-first rather than
      support.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and deploy AI-powered software on cloud and edge devices including iPhone,
    iPad, Vision Pro, Android, and NVidia devices
  - Optimize AI/ML models and pipelines for real-time inference on edge devices to
    meet latency and performance requirements
  - Build containerized AI services using Docker and orchestrate deployments across
    platforms
  - Deploy and maintain real-time microservices for AI applications including GenAI
    applications
  - Work with MLOps and AI security platform team to support continuous integration,
    testing, and monitoring of AI models
  - Design deployment evaluation frameworks and develop unit tests for software components
    in compliance with regulatory requirements
  - Perform software verification and validation testing along with code reviews following
    best coding standards
  - Generate and review necessary documentation with project teams
  use_cases:
  - Computer vision applications for medical device products in surgical and healthcare
    settings
  - Augmented reality and mixed reality interfaces for operating room navigation and
    guidance
  - Generative AI features including LLMs for clinical decision intelligence and treatment
    selection
  - Multi-modal AI systems for image-guided surgery and outcome assessment
  - Real-time AI inference on edge devices for surgical robotics and operating room
    safety
  - Multi-agentic AI frameworks for orchestrating complex clinical workflows
