  title: Forward Deployed Engineer – Agentic AI for Clinical Development
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is a Forward Deployed Engineer role that directly
      builds, deploys, and optimizes agentic AI systems including
      autonomous agents, multi-agent orchestration, reasoning
      loops, and RAG implementations. The role involves hands-on
      work with LLMs, vector databases, and agent frameworks to
      create autonomous clinical workflows, not just supporting AI
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead technical engagements with customers as primary solution consultant and embedded
    engineer for agentic AI deployments
  - Partner with customer stakeholders to scope requirements and deploy agentic AI
    systems enabling autonomous clinical workflows with human oversight
  - Design, architect, and implement tailored solutions integrating Medable's platform
    with eClinical systems and agentic AI frameworks for end-to-end trial automation
  - Demonstrate capabilities through live demos, technical deep dives, and production
    deployments of agentic AI with autonomous agents and multi-agent orchestration
  - Build, deploy, and optimize agentic AI systems in regulated environments enabling
    capabilities like real-time patient matching, adaptive protocol execution, and
    predictive risk mitigation
  - Incorporate robust human-in-the-loop systems including intervention points, validation
    workflows, and hybrid decision-making for compliance and accountability
  - Wrangle large-scale clinical and operational data to power agentic AI reasoning
    and agent coordination with human review processes
  - Develop custom integrations, APIs, configurations, and tooling to support agentic
    AI autonomy and agent system interoperability
  use_cases:
  - Real-time patient matching for clinical trial enrollment
  - Adaptive protocol execution with autonomous decision support
  - Predictive risk mitigation and automated data reconciliation
  - Clinical trial simulation and optimization
  - Automated monitoring of trial operations with safety gates
  - End-to-end trial automation with decentralized workflows
