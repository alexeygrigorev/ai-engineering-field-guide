      model development, deployment, and client-facing
      implementation places this squarely in ai-first.
  responsibilities:
  - Build robust, scalable backend systems that support machine learning operations
    and data processing pipelines
  - Oversee and optimize cloud infrastructure to ensure efficient deployment and operation
    of ML models
  - Work embedded with client teams to conduct use case discovery and develop AI deployment
    solutions
  - Design and deploy scalable ML systems including retrieval-augmented generation
    (RAG) pipelines and production-grade AI applications
  - Integrate advanced ML technologies across platforms, collaborating closely with
    ML engineers and data scientists
  - Participate in research and development of new tools to enhance AI capabilities
    and workflows
  - Support rapid iteration and deployment of machine learning solutions in production-ready
    environments
