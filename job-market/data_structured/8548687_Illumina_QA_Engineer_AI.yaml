    reasoning: |-
      This is a QA Engineer role focused on testing and quality
      assurance for AI systems rather than building or deploying
      them. The responsibilities involve designing test
      strategies, creating test cases, validating AI/ML features,
      and ensuring quality metrics - all supporting the AI
      development work of others rather than directly working on
      models or AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and maintain test plans, test cases, and test data for AI/ML-powered features
    and traditional software
  - Design and execute test strategies for AI/LLM-powered capabilities including virtual
    agents, chatbots, copilots, and RAG-based systems
  - Use LLM-powered tools to accelerate test design, data generation, exploratory
    testing, and script authoring
  - Define and monitor AI-specific quality metrics including accuracy, hallucination
    rates, error rates, and safety/policy adherence
  - Validate data integrity and transformation quality across biomedical data pipelines
    and AI-enhanced workflows
  - Partner with engineers and data scientists to ensure AI/ML models and integrations
    are testable, observable, and measurable post-deployment
  - Integrate automation into CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Azure DevOps,
    GitLab CI) and monitor test health
  - Communicate quality risks, trends, and mitigation plans to technical and non-technical
    stakeholders including government partners
  use_cases:
  - Virtual agents and chatbots for genomic data interactions
  - RAG-based systems for biomedical information retrieval
  - AI copilots for laboratory and clinical workflows
  - Quality assurance for FDA-regulated AI/ML applications in healthcare
  - Test automation using GenAI tools for QA tasks
  - AI-driven data comparison and validation for biomedical data
