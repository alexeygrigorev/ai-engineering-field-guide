      This role is directly building Agentic AI systems including
      autonomous agents, multi-agent frameworks, and Generative AI
      applications using LLMs, RAG, and vector databases. The
      hands-on work with LLMs, prompt engineering, function
      calling, and agent orchestration tools clearly indicates
      this is an AI-first role focused on constructing AI systems
      rather than supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and orchestrate Agentic AI systems with autonomous and semi-autonomous
    agents
  - Lead development of Generative AI applications using LLMs, embeddings, vector
    databases, RAG, and multi-agent frameworks
  - Rapidly convert business problems into working demonstrations and proof of concepts
  - Evaluate, select, and integrate AI frameworks, agent orchestration tools, and
    model providers
  - Develop rapid prototypes with Scrum/Agile teams and scale to enterprise solutions
  - Provide technical leadership, guidance, and mentorship to junior AI engineers
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous and semi-autonomous agent systems with reasoning, planning, tool usage,
    and goal execution
  - Enterprise Generative AI applications using RAG architecture and LLM-powered document
    intelligence
  - Multi-agent collaboration frameworks for complex problem-solving
  - AI-powered copilot and agent builder solutions
  - Cloud-native AI applications with microservices architecture
