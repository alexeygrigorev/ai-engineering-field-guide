  title: AI Software Engineer (Rust)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves working directly with LLMs and the RLHF
      pipeline to improve code generation models. The engineer
      will rank, edit, and provide feedback on AI-generated code,
      which is then used as reward signals to fine-tune the model.
      This is hands-on work with model training and improvement
      through human feedback loops.
  responsibilities:
  - Compare and rank multiple code snippets
  - explaining which is best and why
  - Repair and refactor AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and style
  - Inject feedback including ratings, edits, and test results into the RLHF pipeline
  - Identify logic errors, performance traps, and security issues in code
  - Provide clear written explanations justifying code quality decisions
  - Participate in the reinforcement learning feedback loop to tune code generation
    models
  use_cases:
  - Training large language models to write production-grade code
  - Code evaluation and ranking for RLHF pipeline
  - Generating and improving code across multiple programming languages
  - Converting expert human feedback into reward signals for model tuning
  - Building models that can propose, critique, and improve code automatically
