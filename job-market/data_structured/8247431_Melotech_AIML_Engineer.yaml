      This role involves hands-on building, deploying, and fine-
      tuning ML models including multimodal AI systems. The
      engineer is directly responsible for inference systems,
      model optimization, and transitioning research models to
      production - core AI/ML development work rather than just
      supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Building and deploying production ML models for content and product ecosystem
  - Designing scalable ML infrastructure and pipelines that handle massive media datasets
  - Implementing inference systems for content optimization across multiple verticals
  - Fine-tuning and deploying multimodal AI systems using MLOps best practices
  - Transitioning research models into production-ready systems through collaboration
    with data science teams
  - Optimizing model performance for cost efficiency while maintaining accuracy and
    speed requirements
  - Integrating ML capabilities into existing platforms and building APIs for seamless
    model consumption
  use_cases:
  - Content optimization across media verticals using ML inference
  - Real-time understanding and analysis of cultural trends in media
  - Enhancing creative processes in media and entertainment production using AI
  - Scaling ML systems to serve millions of users with low latency for media content
  - Multimodal AI systems for analyzing and processing media content (audio, video,
    text)
