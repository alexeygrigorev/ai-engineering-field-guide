      This is a software engineer role building web-based games
      and game infrastructure for a generative entertainment
      platform. While the company uses AI in their products and
      workflows, the role involves building game systems,
      infrastructure, and platform integrations using AI-assisted
      development tools rather than building, training, or
      deploying AI/ML models directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Take validated prototypes from concept stage to production-ready games, refactoring
    exploratory code into maintainable, performant systems
  - Build and maintain shared game infrastructure including progression systems, save/load,
    analytics integration, and platform APIs that accelerates development across all
    titles
  - Adapt core systems to the unique requirements of each new game, balancing reusability
    with the flexibility to support diverse gameplay experiences
  - Collaborate with the Creative Engineer to establish clear technical handoff processes
    ensuring promising prototypes have a smooth path to production
  - Leverage AI-assisted development tools to accelerate implementation while maintaining
    code quality and architectural coherence
  - Integrate with distribution platforms, ad networks, and third-party services to
    maximize reach and revenue across the portfolio
  - Identify opportunities to extract reusable components from production games back
    into shared libraries continuously improving development velocity
  - Contribute to technical decision-making around architecture, tooling, and process
    as the game portfolio scales
  use_cases:
  - Generative entertainment universes where creators, players, and AI collaborate
    in real time
  - Crime-solving detective games where players collect evidence, crack cases, and
    rise through ranks of a connected detective program
  - Living, ever-expanding game worlds where intelligent systems learn, adapt, and
    surprise players
  - AI-powered game development workflows that enable rapid prototyping and fast iteration
  - Scalable game platform that supports multiple interconnected game titles with
    shared progression and experiences
