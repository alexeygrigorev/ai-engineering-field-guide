      The role involves building enterprise-grade AI tools and
      operating AI pipeline services, but the focus is on
      infrastructure-level software development (distributed
      systems, reliability, observability) rather than hands-on
      model work. The responsibilities center on building scalable
      platforms that support AI workloads, not building, training,
      or deploying models directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and maintain performant, scalable, and highly available enterprise-level
    software
  - Develop distributed systems that handle real-time and batch processing at scale
  - Ensure reliability, observability, and fault tolerance of AI pipeline services
  - Participate in architecture reviews, code reviews, and technical design discussions
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise-grade AI tools merging databases with AI
  - Real-time and batch processing pipelines for AI workloads
  - Inference and data pipelines in production environments
  - Feature serving systems for ML applications
  - Vector search or embedding-based retrieval pipelines
