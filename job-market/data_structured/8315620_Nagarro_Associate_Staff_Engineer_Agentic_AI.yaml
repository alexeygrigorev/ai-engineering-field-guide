    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role focuses on building, prototyping, and deploying
      Agentic AI systems including multi-agent systems, knowledge
      graphs, agentic memory, and LLMs. It requires hands-on work
      translating research into production-ready AI systems and
      directly working with novel AI technologies.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead end-to-end research projects from problem formulation to evaluation, translating
    novel ideas into scalable AI systems
  - Develop prototypes and reference implementations demonstrating novel agentic AI
    concepts and technologies
  - Publish research in top-tier conferences and journals, file patents, and contribute
    to technical whitepapers
  - Work closely with engineering teams to transition research prototypes into scalable
    production systems
  - Design experiments and benchmarks on real-world datasets and influence platform
    architecture decisions
  - Understand client business use cases and convert them into technical designs that
    elegantly meet requirements
  - Develop overall solution architectures including technologies, patterns, and frameworks
    for functional and non-functional requirements
  - Conduct POCs to validate that suggested designs and technologies meet client requirements
  use_cases:
  - Agentic AI systems with multi-agent capabilities for autonomous problem-solving
  - Knowledge graphs and neuro-symbolic reasoning for complex inference tasks
  - Agentic memory systems for maintaining context and state across interactions
  - Advanced LLM-based reasoning applications for enterprise clients
  - Research-to-production AI systems in Digital Product Engineering contexts
