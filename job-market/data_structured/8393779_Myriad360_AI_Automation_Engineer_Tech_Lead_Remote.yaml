      The role involves hands-on design and implementation of LLM-
      based agents, AI-powered workflows, and RAG pipelines. The
      engineer directly builds and deploys agentic solutions using
      ChatGPT Enterprise and various AI frameworks, making it a
      hands-on AI development position rather than support
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, prototype, and implement AI-powered workflows and agentic solutions, including
    task- and process-specific agents, copilots, and multi-step orchestrations
  - Build and optimize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines that securely
    leverage internal data, including data preparation, vectorization, retrieval design,
    and relevance tuning
  - Develop and maintain integrations across systems using APIs such as Microsoft
    Graph API, OpenAI API, and automation platforms like Power Automate, Zapier, n8n,
    and Make
  - Implement observability, monitoring, evaluation, and guardrails for AI agents
    and workflows, including logging, metrics, and feedback loops that support continuous
    improvement
  - Partner with business leaders and department heads to map current processes, elicit
    requirements, and identify high-value AI and automation opportunities
  - Collaborate with third-party delivery partners and vendors to divide and conquer
    the AI/automation backlog, provide technical direction, and review solution designs
    for quality, security, and maintainability
  use_cases:
  - Automate sales processes and workflows to reduce manual tasks and improve efficiency
  - Streamline operations and finance functions through AI-powered copilots and agents
  - Enhance IT service delivery with intelligent automation and RAG-powered information
    retrieval
  - Improve cross-functional business processes by integrating Microsoft 365 ecosystem
    with AI agents
  - Enable secure internal data access and knowledge management through RAG pipelines
  - Deploy task-specific agents to handle department-specific workflows across the
    organization
