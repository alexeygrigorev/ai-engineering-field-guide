    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is hands-on prompt engineering, directly working
      with LLMs, OpenAI API, and GPT models. The engineer will be
      fine-tuning, testing, and optimizing prompts to ensure high-
      quality AI output, which is core AI/ML development work.
  responsibilities:
  - Migrate and test existing bulk flashcard creation prompts in updated AI environment
    with newer GPT models
  - Run test suites and manually review AI outputs for quality and correctness, fine-tuning
    prompts as needed
  - Analyze real user data to identify failure patterns and inform prompt improvements
  - Streamline testing and evaluation workflows to make QA faster and more repeatable
  - Monitor production quality post-launch and detect regressions as underlying models
    shift
  - Build and maintain model evaluation datasets from real user inputs across all
    AI features
  - Write new test cases for edge cases, multilingual content, and messy real-world
    inputs
  - Document prompt changes, test results, and lessons learned while working with
    Content Team on quality standards
  use_cases:
  - Bulk flashcard creation from pasted or uploaded content
  - Document summarization into flashcards
  - Generating flashcards from user-described topics
  - Multilingual flashcard creation
  - Converting messy real-world inputs into structured flashcard content
