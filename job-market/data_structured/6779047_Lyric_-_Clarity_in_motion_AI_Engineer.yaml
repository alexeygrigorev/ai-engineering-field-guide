      This is hands-on AI engineering work building RAG systems,
      LLM-based solutions, agentic systems, and embedding models.
      The role specifically focuses on building and optimizing ML
      models and verifiable ML systems for production, not
      supporting AI work.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and optimize systems capable of processing large volumes of data in both
    batch and real-time
  - Design, implement, and optimize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems that
    leverage the latest LLM technologies
  - Develop and refine embedding models, vector databases, and retrieval mechanisms
    that maximize search relevance
  - Create robust evaluation frameworks to measure quality and improve LLM-based solutions
    based on user feedback
  - Build and optimize machine learning models and verifiable ML systems for medical
    and insurance data analysis
  - Build and optimize production-ready systems that are scalable and can handle large
    amounts of data
  - Build and optimize agentic systems that can reason and make decisions
  - Develop machine learning models in healthcare and insurance settings with the
    highest standards for safety and quality
  use_cases:
  - Pre-payment accuracy and integrity in healthcare insurance claims
  - Search and analysis of complex medical and insurance data
  - Preventing inaccurate payments and reducing waste in healthcare ecosystem
  - Clinical policy analysis and medical coding verification
  - Healthcare claim processing and validation
