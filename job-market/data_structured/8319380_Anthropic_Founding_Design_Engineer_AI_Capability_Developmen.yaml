  title: Founding Design Engineer, AI Capability Development, Education Labs
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a full-stack product engineering role focused on
      building AI-native product features and user experiences,
      not on building, training, or fine-tuning AI models. The
      role involves shipping production features to millions of
      users, working on interaction design, front-end/back-end
      development, and integrating Claude as a capability-building
      partner, but does not involve direct work on AI systems
      themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Ship features that help users develop real skill with AI, measuring success by
    capability growth rather than engagement metrics
  - Architect end-to-end prototypes (front-end and back-end) that test new interaction
    paradigms with focus on motion, polish, and interaction feel
  - Define technical direction for the team and establish patterns others can follow
  - Build relationships across Product, Design, and Research to influence how skill
    development principles shape broader product strategy
  - Shape team strategy and roadmap by identifying high-leverage opportunities and
    building conviction across stakeholders
  - Translate research insights about skill development and human-AI collaboration
    into shipped products through collaboration with researchers
  use_cases:
  - Helping users develop genuine AI skills and capabilities through product experiences
  - Integrating skill development directly into AI product design to make users progressively
    more capable
  - Using Claude as an active capability-building partner in the user experience
  - Measuring user growth and capability outcomes rather than traditional engagement
    metrics
  - Exploring new AI interaction paradigms that enhance human agency and capability
