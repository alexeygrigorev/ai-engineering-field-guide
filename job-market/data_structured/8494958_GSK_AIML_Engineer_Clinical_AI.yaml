    type: ml-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on development and validation of
      state-of-the-art machine learning models, including deep
      learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) for biomedical
      prediction tasks. The focus is on traditional/deep learning
      approaches rather than LLMs or generative AI agents.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement AI/ML-driven solutions along the entire model development
    life cycle
  - Research and develop state-of-the-art machine learning models, including deep
    learning models, to optimize model performance on biomedical prediction tasks
  - Deliver robust, tested and performant code in an agile environment
  - Liaise with experts in biology, medicine and experimentation to ensure optimal
    collection of data to train biomedical machine learning models
  use_cases:
  - Development of novel therapies for existing diseases
  - Personalized drug development for better health outcomes
  - Biomedical prediction tasks in clinical applications
  - Rapid response to emerging or changing diseases
  - Clinical AI solutions for priority disease applications
