      This is an Applied AI Engineer role that directly works on
      building, tuning, deploying, and optimizing AI models for
      real-world applications. The engineer is responsible for
      post-training, evaluation, and integrating AI inference
      engines with hardware, working hands-on with agents, world
      models, and perception systems in production environments.
  responsibilities:
  - Embed with partners to solve complex problems using frontier AI/ML tools and inform
    research and product development
  - Build, tune, and optimize models for deployment in constrained hardware environments
    with real-world interference
  - Develop high-performance integration code connecting AI inference engines with
    legacy sensors, RTOS, and diverse hardware peripherals
  - Serve as the primary filter between real-world physical constraints and research
    staff to surface commercial challenges
  - Optimize complex ML models for harsh computing environments and validate plans
    using simulation and world-model capabilities
  - Translate probabilistic AI outputs into deterministic language for industrial
    control systems and mission operators
  - Deploy, evaluate, and debug models throughout their lifecycle from prototype to
    production
  use_cases:
  - Spatial and temporal reasoning agents for complex environments
  - World models and simulation environments for training and evaluation
  - Video understanding with generalization beyond gaming applications
  - Robotic systems with perception, sensor fusion, and inverse dynamics
  - Industrial automation and manufacturing with AI-powered control systems
  - Aerospace and defense applications with edge AI deployment
