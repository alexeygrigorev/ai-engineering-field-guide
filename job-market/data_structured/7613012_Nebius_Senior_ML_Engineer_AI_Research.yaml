      This is an applied AI research role focused on training,
      fine-tuning, and optimizing large language models and
      agentic systems. The responsibilities include reinforcement
      learning for agents, guided search in trajectory space,
      model distillation, and web-scale data mining for model
      post-training - all hands-on work directly with AI models
      and training systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Conducting experiments to figure out efficient ways to train a large language
    model on traces of interactions with various environments
  - Exploring methods of guided generation and search in the trajectory space
  - Coming up with ways to mine relevant data at web scale and figuring out efficient
    ways to use this data in model post-training
  - Conducting experiments with different reinforcement learning configurations in
    verifiable domains
  - Exploring methods to train AI agents on tasks with non-verifiable reward signals
  - Collaborating with adjacent teams to apply research findings in practice
  - Documenting research findings clearly and contributing to technical publications
    or reports
  use_cases:
  - Applying reinforcement learning for agent training in long-context multi-turn
    scenarios
  - Dramatically scaling task data collection to power reinforcement learning for
    SWE agents
  - Building decontaminated evaluation systems for SWE agents that are regularly updated
  - Using test-time guided search to build more powerful AI agents
  - Training agents and reasoning models using guided search and reinforcement learning
    techniques
  - Efficient model distillation for improving model performance
