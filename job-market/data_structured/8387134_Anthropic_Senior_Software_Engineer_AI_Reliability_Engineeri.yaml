    reasoning: |-
      This role is AI Reliability Engineering focused on
      infrastructure, monitoring, and operational aspects of model
      serving systems. The engineer is NOT building, training,
      fine-tuning, or deploying models, but rather building the
      platform and systems that SUPPORT model serving (SLOs,
      monitoring, failover, cost optimization for GPU
      infrastructure).
  responsibilities:
  - Develop Service Level Objectives for large language model serving and training
    systems, balancing availability and latency with development velocity
  - Design and implement monitoring systems including availability, latency and other
    salient metrics for AI infrastructure
  - Design and implement high-availability language model serving infrastructure capable
    of handling millions of external customers and high-traffic internal workloads
  - Develop and manage automated failover and recovery systems for model serving deployments
    across multiple regions and cloud providers
  - Lead incident response for critical AI services, ensuring rapid recovery and systematic
    improvements from each incident
  - Build and maintain cost optimization systems for large-scale AI infrastructure,
    focusing on accelerator (GPU/TPU/Trainium) utilization and efficiency
  use_cases:
  - Large-scale language model serving infrastructure for millions of external customers
  - High-traffic internal AI workloads and training pipelines
  - Distributed model serving across multiple regions and cloud providers
  - Real-time inference with strict latency and availability requirements
  - GPU/TPU accelerator infrastructure for model training and serving
