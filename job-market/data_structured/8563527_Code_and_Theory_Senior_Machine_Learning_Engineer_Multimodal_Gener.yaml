      The role requires hands-on experience building and deploying
      multimodal generative AI models including text-to-image,
      image-to-text, diffusion models, and transformer-based
      architectures. The candidate will work directly on model
      optimization, fine-tuning with LoRA, and production
      deployment of AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and deploy multimodal generative AI models spanning text, vision, audio,
    and video modalities
  - Implement cross-modal architectures and multimodal fusion techniques
  - Optimize models for production deployment including model serving and monitoring
  - Apply generative model architectures such as diffusion models, transformers, and
    GANs
  - Fine-tune and adapt models using techniques like LoRA and efficient adaptation
    methods
  - Mentor team members and advocate for adoption of emerging AI technologies
  use_cases:
  - Text-to-image generation and cross-modal applications
  - Image-to-text and multimodal understanding systems
  - Creative content generation across media types
  - Enterprise solutions integrating multimodal AI capabilities
