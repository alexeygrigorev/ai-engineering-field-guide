    reasoning: |-
      This is a Data Engineer role that builds data platforms and
      infrastructure to enable AI/ML work for data science teams.
      While the role supports AI use cases like RAG and
      recommendation systems through feature pipelines and ML-
      ready datasets, the focus is on data engineering (pipelines,
      ETL, data models) that powers AI work rather than building,
      training, or deploying models directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and maintain scalable batch and streaming data pipelines using
    AWS services like S3, Glue, Lambda, Kinesis, Step Functions, Redshift, Athena,
    and DynamoDB
  - Develop and optimize data models and complex SQL queries to support analytics,
    reporting, and downstream consumers
  - Partner with Data Science and AI teams to productionize ML-ready datasets, including
    training, evaluation, and inference data pipelines
  - Build and maintain feature pipelines and embedding workflows that support ML models
    and experimentation
  - Enable AI use cases such as recommendation systems, personalization, and retrieval-augmented
    generation (RAG) through robust data foundations
  - Ensure data quality, reliability, and observability through automated testing,
    validation, monitoring, and alerting
  - Implement cloud-first, microservices-based architectures ensuring high availability,
    performance, and cost efficiency
  use_cases:
  - College recruitment and student engagement analytics
  - Personalization systems for student outreach
  - Recommendation systems connecting students with colleges
  - Retrieval-augmented generation for AI-powered search and insights
  - Strategic enrollment planning for higher education institutions
