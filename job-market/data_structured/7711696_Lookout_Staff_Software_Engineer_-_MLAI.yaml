  title: Staff Software Engineer - ML/AI
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      Role involves owning the full ML lifecycle including model
      training, deployment, and continuous retraining. Explicitly
      mentions hands-on work with LLM/RAG stack (embeddings,
      vector databases, prompt engineering), LLM fine-tuning
      (LoRA, PEFT), and modern AI frameworks (Hugging Face,
      LangChain). This is direct model-building and deployment
      work, not supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Own the full machine learning lifecycle from initial research and design to production
    deployment, monitoring, and continuous retraining
  - Establish and implement robust frameworks to train, evaluate, stress-test, and
    monitor ML/AI systems to drive continuous improvement and prevent model drift
  - Address real-world scale and performance challenges ensuring ML/AI models are
    efficient, robust, and maintain target quality and latency under production constraints
  - Set technical direction as a senior Individual Contributor and mentor junior engineers
  - Improve all forms of automated testing including unit, integration, and functional
    testing
  - Participate in end-to-end service ownership including on-call duties for services
    and components
  use_cases:
  - Mobile endpoint threat detection using behavioral analysis and AI
  - Detection of human-centric attacks including social engineering and phishing
  - Malware detection and software vulnerability identification on mobile devices
  - Anomalous activity monitoring across enterprise mobile endpoints
  - LLM-powered security analysis and threat intelligence processing
