    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work building and orchestrating
      AI agent systems, designing multi-agent workflows, and
      integrating LLMs into the development stack. The engineer is
      directly implementing agentic frameworks, writing prompts,
      and creating systems where AI agents collaboratively plan,
      write, review, and deploy code - not just supporting AI
      work.
  responsibilities:
  - Design multi-agent systems with coding-focused agents including code writer, reviewer,
    tester, and deployer roles
  - Write prompts, logic, and scaffolding to guide each agent's behavior within the
    system
  - Handle tool use integration enabling agents to access file systems, test runners,
    version control, and internal APIs
  - Evaluate and refine agents' output, performance, collaboration patterns, and feedback
    loops
  - Prototype coding assistant workflows using open-source LLMs and internal knowledge
    bases
  - Lead architecture discussions on agentic build pipelines and automated PR generation
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to build fast, AI-powered interfaces for
    internal tooling
  - Define evaluation frameworks for AI contributions measuring accuracy, speed, and
    impact
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered software development workflow automation using agentic systems
  - Multi-agent collaboration for code planning, writing, reviewing, testing, and
    deployment
  - Automated PR generation and agentic build pipeline integration
  - AI-assisted UI prototyping acceleration using TypeScript and AI tools
  - Internal tooling interfaces enhanced with generative AI capabilities
  - Safe and secure integration of generative AI into public sector codebase
