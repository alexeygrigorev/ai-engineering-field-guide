      This role sits at the intersection of ML research and data
      engineering, focusing on building large-scale data pipelines
      to fuel model training. The engineer designs systems to
      acquire, process, and curate multimodal datasets rather than
      building, training, or deploying the models themselves. They
      enable the work of ML researchers by providing high-quality
      data infrastructure and tools.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement large-scale data acquisition, processing, and curation pipelines,
    owning the full lifecycle of high-quality datasets used to train advanced robotics
    and foundation models
  - Continuously improve dataset quality and utility through sophisticated data analysis,
    debugging, and experimentation; developing metrics, tests, and monitoring mechanisms
    that directly drive model performance improvements
  - Develop and scale multimodal data pipelines for ingestion, preprocessing, filtering,
    annotation, and storage across video, LiDAR, and telemetry modalities
  - Run systematic experiments on data ablations and composition to assess their impact
    on model training dynamics, generalisation, and downstream performance
  - Collaborate with ML researchers and platform engineers to ensure datasets are
    fit for purpose and efficiently integrated into large-scale training workflows
  - Build internal tools and workflows for dataset auditing, visualization, and versioning
    to streamline iteration and reproducibility
  - Advance best practices for data governance, reliability, and scalability across
    the data lifecycle; ensuring data safety, privacy, and long-term maintainability
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous driving systems that perceive, understand, and navigate complex environments
    without maps
  - World model architectures (GAIA and successors) for embodied AI systems
  - Synthetic data and simulation pipelines to accelerate autonomy development
  - Training foundation models using multimodal sensor data from vehicles
  - Large-scale robotics and autonomous vehicle model training
