  title: AI Ops Engineer

    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      The role focuses on data science tools, model deployment
      pipelines (MLflow, Kubeflow), and infrastructure operations
      (AWS, Airflow, DevOps tools) rather than building or fine-
      tuning AI models themselves. While there's mention of ML
      model implementation, the primary emphasis is on
      operationalizing, deploying, and managing ML systems at
      scale, which classifies this as supporting AI work rather
      than directly working on AI/ML models.
  responsibilities:
  - Drive and embed design and implementation of data science tools and methods to
    create market-leading customer solutions
  - Act as subject matter expert to articulate advanced data and analytics opportunities
    through data visualization
  - Proactively apply statistical, mathematical, machine-learning, and software engineering
    skills to develop solutions and algorithms
  - Implement ethically sound models end-to-end with software engineering and product
    development practices
  - Lead teams in Agile methodology within multi-disciplinary data projects to achieve
    agreed Scrum outcomes
  - Select, build, train, and test complex machine learning models considering valuation,
    risk, governance, and ethics
  - Deploy, fine-tune, and optimize ML models while managing versioning and drift
    detection pipelines
  use_cases:
  - Develop data-driven customer solutions for banking services
  - Advanced analytics and visualization for business stakeholder insights
  - Machine learning model deployment for financial risk assessment and customer support
  - Complex data issue debugging and incident management for customer-facing ML applications
  - Model governance and ethical implementation for banking compliance
