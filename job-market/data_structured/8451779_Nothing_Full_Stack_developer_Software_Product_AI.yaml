    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is an ai-first role because the developer is building
      AI interfaces and services directly - working with LLMs, RAG
      systems, agents, MCPs, and vector databases. The role
      involves prototyping novel AI interactions, optimizing AI
      performance for real-time responsiveness, and architecting
      the AI service layer that powers these experiences.
  responsibilities:
  - Rapidly prototype and ship novel AI interfaces including chat, voice, and multi-modal
    interactions for Nothing OS
  - Translate experimental concepts into production-grade full-stack applications
    using Next.js, React, and Node/Python
  - Optimize AI latency, real-time performance, and micro-interactions to make digital
    assistants feel responsive and human
  - Define and architect underlying patterns and frameworks for the AI service layer
    to scale globally
  - Collaborate with hardware and OS teams to create seamless experiences across web,
    mobile, and embedded surfaces
  - Work with Product Designers to invent new interaction models beyond traditional
    screen-tap paradigms
  - Manage deployment pipelines and infrastructure choices to maintain high shipping
    velocity
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered conversational interfaces and chat experiences
  - Voice-based interactions and digital assistant experiences
  - Multi-modal human-computer interaction combining voice, chat, and other inputs
