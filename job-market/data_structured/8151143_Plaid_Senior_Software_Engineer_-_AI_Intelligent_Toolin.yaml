      This role builds internal platforms and developer tooling
      that enables AI adoption at Plaid, rather than building AI
      models or agents directly. The focus is on integrating AI-
      powered tools into SDLC workflows, operating internal
      platforms, and improving developer experience - all of which
      support AI work without hands-on model development.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and operate internal tools and services used by Plaid's engineers
  - Integrate AI-powered tools and workflows into core engineering processes
  - Improve reliability, usability, and performance of existing internal platforms
  - Own systems end-to-end, including production support and iterative improvement
  - Collaborate with teammates and stakeholders to deliver practical, high-impact
    solutions
  use_cases:
  - AI coding integrations for developer productivity
  - SDLC agents that automate development lifecycle tasks
  - Internal tools powered by AI for engineering operations
  - Delegation of lower-leverage work to AI agents
  - Developer workflows enhanced with AI-powered automation
