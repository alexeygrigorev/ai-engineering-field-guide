      This role involves hands-on work building and deploying LLM-
      based agentic AI systems, including tool use, RAG, multi-
      agent architecture, and agent evaluation frameworks. The
      engineer will directly work with LangChain/LangGraph,
      OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, and build the agentic AI system
      architecture for Night Shift.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and deploy agentic AI systems with LLM-based agents using tools, retrieval,
    memory, and guardrails
  - Design and implement multi-agent architectural patterns, planning systems, and
    context management
  - Develop and own the AI evaluation framework with offline/online eval harnesses,
    metrics, and regression testing
  - Implement RAG systems with vector/hybrid search, rerankers, and attribution for
    claims
  - Build ML platform infrastructure including web services, cloud infrastructure,
    observability, and monitoring
  - Lead R&D initiatives for improving system performance through fine-tuning, embeddings,
    and multimodal understanding
  use_cases:
  - AI research assistant (Night Shift) that automates repetitive case investigation
    tasks for law enforcement
  - Agentic system that helps investigators work cases faster by automating tedious
    steps
  - Search, retrieval, and recommendation system for case-related information
  - Safety and compliance monitoring with red-teaming and regression testing
