  title: Senior Data and AI engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      The role focuses on building data infrastructure, pipelines,
      and platforms that support AI/ML workloads rather than
      directly building or deploying models. While it mentions
      supporting agentic AI applications and model
      training/deployment processes, the core work involves data
      engineering, data lakes, and enabling MLOps workflows for
      data science teams, which aligns with ai-support.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and maintain robust, scalable, and efficient data pipelines to
    ingest, transform, and serve data for AI/ML and analytics workloads
  - Architect and maintain scalable, secure, and low-latency data pipelines and systems
    to support agentic AI applications
  - Partner with Data Science teams to support model training, feature engineering,
    and deployment processes
  - Develop and manage data architecture, data lakes, and data warehouses supporting
    Service AI use cases including ticket analytics, customer interaction insights,
    predictive maintenance, and resource planning
  - Optimize data storage, compute, and retrieval strategies for structured and unstructured
    data including logs, text, images, and telemetry data
  - Support MLOps workflows by enabling model deployment, monitoring, and versioning
    pipelines
  - Collaborate with data scientists, project managers, software engineering teams,
    and service support stakeholders to translate business requirements into technical
    solutions
  use_cases:
  - Ticket analytics for service and support operations
  - Customer interaction insights and analysis
  - Predictive maintenance for equipment
  - Resource planning optimization
  - Agentic AI applications for service support
  - Enterprise-scale data integration for CRM and service platforms
