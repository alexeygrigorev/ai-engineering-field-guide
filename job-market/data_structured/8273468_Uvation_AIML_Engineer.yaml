  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and deploy ML models for classification, regression, NLP, computer
    vision, and time-series forecasting
  - Clean, preprocess, and transform structured and unstructured datasets while engineering
    relevant features
  - Package and deploy models using Docker, Flask/FastAPI, and Kubernetes with CI/CD
    pipelines
  - Implement MLOps practices using MLflow, Airflow, or Kubeflow for monitoring model
    drift and performance
  - Translate real-world business problems into AI/ML use cases and prototype AI-driven
    solutions
  - Experiment with cutting-edge models including LLMs, transformers, and generative
    AI technologies
  - Collaborate cross-functionally with software developers, DevOps, data analysts,
    and domain experts
