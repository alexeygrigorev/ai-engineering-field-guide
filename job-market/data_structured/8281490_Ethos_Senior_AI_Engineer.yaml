      This role involves building and deploying LLM-powered
      copilots with hands-on work on RAG systems, LLM
      orchestration, and GPU inference optimization. The engineer
      directly owns the LLM + retrieval + context layer,
      implementing model-centric features like embeddings,
      reranking, and function calling.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and own the LLM + retrieval + context layer for multiple copilot applications
    across underwriting, agent enablement, customer support, and fraud workflows
  - Implement production RAG systems including indexing, retrieval, hybrid search,
    reranking, query rewriting, grounding, and citation management
  - Develop context graph with entity resolution, linking, provenance, graph + vector
    retrieval for multi-hop context
  - Orchestrate LLM operations with tool and function calling, structured outputs,
    routing across model tiers, and failure mode handling
  - Optimize GPU inference costs and latency through batching, caching, KV reuse,
    quantization, and autoscaling strategies
  - Implement safety and compliance features including PII/PHI handling, redaction,
    audit logs, deterministic replay, and hallucination mitigation
  - Build LLMOps infrastructure with evaluation harness using golden sets, regression
    testing, and adversarial testing, plus monitoring for quality, cost, and drift
  - Design and ship end-to-end pipelines from retrieve to assemble context to generate
    to cite to log/monitor with measurable quality metrics
  use_cases:
  - LLM-powered copilots for underwriting productivity to help insurance underwriters
    work more efficiently
  - Agent enablement tools that provide AI assistance to insurance agents during customer
    interactions
  - Customer support automation using AI to handle insurance-related inquiries and
    provide accurate, cited responses
  - Operations and compliance copilots to streamline internal workflows and ensure
    regulatory adherence
  - Fraud detection and prevention using AI to analyze patterns and identify suspicious
    activities in insurance applications
  - Multi-hop context retrieval across complex insurance documents to provide comprehensive,
    accurate answers to domain-specific questions
