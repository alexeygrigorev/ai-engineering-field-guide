  - Review, evaluate, and influence designs and project activities for compliance
    with development guidelines and standards
  - Provide solutions that improve product quality and mitigate failure risk through
    innovative approaches
  - Mentor less-experienced team members in software systems design and development
    best practices
  - Act as internal authority on software systems design consulted across organizations
    and Business Units
  - Contribute to external technical community through whitepapers, patents, and innovations
  - Lead overall architecture of software systems for products and solutions
  use_cases:
  - Large-scale AI and HPC systems performance optimization and engineering
  - Design and integration of scalable software systems across multiple platform types
  - Software systems testing and methodology including test plans and debugging
  - Simulation, modeling, and emulation capabilities for AI/HPC applications
  - Architecting innovative software system design tools and languages
  - Cross-domain distributed computing solutions for enterprise products
