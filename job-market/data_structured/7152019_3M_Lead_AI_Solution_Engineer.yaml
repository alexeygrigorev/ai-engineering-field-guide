      The role involves hands-on work building and deploying AI
      systems including LLMs, agentic AI systems, RAG pipelines,
      and vector databases. While it includes leadership and MLOps
      responsibilities, the core technical work is directly
      developing AI/ML solutions rather than just supporting
      infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the design, development, and deployment of AI/ML and Generative AI solutions
    ensuring scalability, security, and performance
  - Define standards for LLMOps/MLOps, model lifecycle management, governance, and
    compliance while embedding responsible AI principles
  - Lead, mentor, and upskill engineers, data scientists, and architects while fostering
    an innovation-driven culture
  - Develop and deploy agentic AI systems, RAG pipelines, vector databases, and AI
    orchestration frameworks for enterprise workflows
  - Implement robust security, privacy, and ethical AI practices with policies for
    model explainability, drift monitoring, and lineage tracking
  - Evaluate and adopt emerging AI technologies including LLMs, LangChain, Semantic
    Kernel, and vector databases through proof-of-concept initiatives
  - Collaborate with business stakeholders, cloud architects, and product teams as
    the AI thought leader to deliver transformative solutions
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise agentic AI systems integration
  - RAG-based knowledge retrieval and document processing
  - Vector database powered semantic search applications
  - Generative AI workflow automation and orchestration
  - AI governance, compliance, and responsible AI deployment
  - Multi-cloud AI solution deployment across global environments
