      This is a hands-on AI engineering role that directly builds,
      deploys, and optimizes LLM-powered applications including
      RAG systems, agentic AI, and intelligent automation. The
      role involves training/fine-tuning models, implementing
      retrieval patterns, and shipping production-grade AI systems
      rather than just supporting AI infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and deploy LLM-powered applications including RAG, intelligent
    automation, and agentic AI
  - Lead the definition, development, and delivery of machine learning models including
    training/fine-tuning and deployment
  - Lead testing, deployment, and ongoing maintenance of AI systems with operational
    runbooks and support processes
  - Optimize AI systems for performance, scalability, latency, and cost using architectural
    techniques
  - Partner with data and engineering leads to architect AI-powered systems end-to-end
    including data pipelines and integrations
  - Establish evaluation frameworks, monitoring, and observability to ensure accurate
    and reliable AI system performance
  - Collaborate with business teams to identify automation opportunities and translate
    requirements into technical solutions
  - Define architecture patterns, development standards, and reusable components to
    enable AI delivery at scale
  use_cases:
  - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and hybrid search for financial information
    retrieval
  - Intelligent automation for ETF operations and business processes
  - Agentic AI systems for autonomous decision support in investment workflows
  - Structured data extraction and validation from unstructured financial documents
  - Multi-model routing and provider selection for optimal AI performance in regulated
    environments
  - AI-powered search and grounding for compliance and regulatory information access
