      This role involves direct work with foundational models
      including training, evaluation, and innovation of large
      language/vision models. The role requires hands-on
      experience with multi-GPU model training and developing
      frameworks for ML platforms, which is building ON AI systems
      rather than supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and develop cutting-edge frameworks that serve as future tools for innovative
    platforms and systems driving trading and research efforts using foundational
    models
  - Collaborate closely with researchers and engineers to ensure framework compatibility
    with recent cloud platforms, popular ML frameworks, libraries, and modern model
    architectures
  - Define and run large-scale experiments contributing to rigorous evaluation and
    in-depth model analysis
  - Train, evaluate, and innovate on foundational models across various data modalities
    including language, vision, multimodal, and structured data
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered trading systems and platforms
  - Research-driven analysis and evaluation of foundational models
  - Multimodal AI applications combining language, vision, and structured data for
    trading insights
  - Large-scale ML model training and evaluation for financial markets
  - High-performance frameworks for ML research and deployment
