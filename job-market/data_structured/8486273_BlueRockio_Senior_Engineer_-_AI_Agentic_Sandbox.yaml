  title: Senior Engineer - AI & Agentic Sandbox
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      The role focuses on building security infrastructure and
      observability systems that hook into AI frameworks (CrewAI,
      OpenAI Agents, LangChain) to monitor and secure agent
      execution. The engineer is NOT building, training, or fine-
      tuning AI models, but rather creating security platforms and
      instrumentation to protect and monitor AI systems built by
      others.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop BlueRock Agentic Sandbox multi-language runtime security platform
  - Build Deep-Trace Observability infrastructure that hooks into AI frameworks like
    CrewAI, Google ADK, and OpenAI Agents
  - Monitor and intercept malicious intent in AI agents in real-time
  - Secure the entire lifecycle from agent orchestration to execution
  - Implement monkey patching, import hooking, and dynamic instrumentation for Python
    or JS/Node.js
  - Integrate observability solutions using OpenTelemetry or Datadog for distributed
    tracing
  use_cases:
  - Real-time monitoring and interception of malicious intent in AI agents
  - Runtime security for multi-language AI applications
  - Agent orchestration security from development to execution
  - Deep-trace observability for AI framework interactions
  - Protection against security vulnerabilities in AI-powered applications
