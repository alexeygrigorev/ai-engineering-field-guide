      The role involves building, deploying, fine-tuning, and
      optimizing LLMs, multi-modal models, and agentic AI systems
      directly. It requires hands-on experience with RAG, prompt
      engineering, and deploying models at scale - all core ai-
      first activities.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and develop autonomous AI systems integrating multi-modal LLMs (text,
    image, audio, video)
  - Design agentic workflows enabling AI agents to interact with data sources and
    APIs using prompt engineering and RAG
  - Fine-tune, optimize, and deploy large language and multi-modal models with a focus
    on performance and latency
  - Build scalable MLOps pipelines and full-stack applications to support robust,
    production-grade AI deployments
  - Guide multidisciplinary teams and clients through strategic decisions in AI engineering
    and GenAI adoption
  - Drive impactful outcomes through advanced engineering, scalable pipelines, and
    deep cross-functional collaboration
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous AI systems with multi-modal capabilities for financial services
  - Agentic workflows for AI agents interacting with enterprise data sources and APIs
  - Generative AI solutions integrated into enterprise-scale financial systems
  - MLOps pipelines for production-grade AI deployments in financial institutions
  - Strategic GenAI adoption and implementation for Tier 1 financial institutions
