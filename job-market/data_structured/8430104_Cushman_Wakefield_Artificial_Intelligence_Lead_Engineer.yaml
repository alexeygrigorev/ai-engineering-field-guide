    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is an AI-first role requiring hands-on engineering of
      LLMs, multimodal models, graph neural networks, and agent-
      based systems. The candidate directly builds, deploys, and
      fine-tunes AI models and implements RAG pipelines, vector
      search, and LLMOps practices rather than just supporting
      infrastructure or data pipelines for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Define and evolve AI strategy shaping how LLMs, multimodal models, predictive
    analytics, and agent-based automation drive value across workplace, portfolio,
    transactions, sustainability, and FM operations
  - Design, engineer, and deploy AI/ML systems using Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust
    with frameworks including TensorFlow, PyTorch, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, and
    LlamaIndex
  - Develop reference architectures for AI microservices, model serving infrastructure,
    vector search and retrieval pipelines, and real-time event-driven AI applications
  - Implement MLOps and LLMOps practices including CI/CD for models and prompts, drift
    detection, model monitoring, evaluation, and human feedback loops
  - Build robust pipelines for ingestion, transformation, and ML feature extraction
    from real estate datasets including leases, occupancy, transactions, IoT telemetry,
    and operational workflows
  - Develop intelligent features for transaction modeling, lease abstraction and document
    automation, workplace experience analytics, space demand forecasting, facility
    optimization, and portfolio scenario modeling
  - Build advanced copilots, agents, and workflow automation for internal teams and
    client-facing experiences
  - Establish governance for AI/ML assets including model lineage, data quality controls,
    automated testing, fairness, bias detection, and interpretability
  use_cases:
  - Transaction modeling and lease abstraction with document automation
  - Workplace experience analytics and space demand forecasting
  - Facility optimization and predictive operations
  - Portfolio scenario modeling and corporate portfolio optimization
  - Copilots and workflow automation for real estate consulting
  - Intelligent decision support across occupier lifecycle from transactions to operations
