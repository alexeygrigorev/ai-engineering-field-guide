      This role involves hands-on work building AI agents and ML
      systems, specifically an "AI tax development agent" that
      understands tax law and generates software code. The role
      requires experience with reinforcement learning algorithms,
      machine learning pipelines, and deploying advanced AI
      technologies into production software.
  responsibilities:
  - Build agentic tooling that understands tax law, converts it to software code,
    and tests itself for correctness
  - Ingest and process millions of data points from documents, partner integrations,
    and external APIs to auto-fill tax returns
  - Build and extend APIs for partners to enable seamless and intuitive integration
  - Create user interface for the embedded tax platform, translating complex tax code
    into accessible UI
  use_cases:
  - AI tax agent that understands tax law and generates code implementations
  - Automated tax form completion using document ingestion and data processing
  - Embedded tax platform APIs for partner integrations
  - Tax return auto-filling system powered by machine learning
  - Reinforcement learning algorithms for tax optimization and correctness
