  title: Principal AI/ML Engineer - Remote
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on building of ML/LLM models
      including GNNs, GANs, Transformers, and LLMs with direct
      experience in LLM alignment (DPO, PPO) and optimization. The
      engineer will experiment, optimize, and deploy models into
      production, which is core ai-first work rather than
      supporting infrastructure or general software engineering.
  responsibilities:
  - Drive end-to-end Machine Learning projects with high ambiguity, scale and complexity
  - Build ML models, perform proof-of-concept, experiment, optimize, and deploy models
    into production
  - Perform hands-on analysis and modeling of healthcare datasets to develop business
    insights
  - Run A/B experiments, gather data, and perform statistical analysis
  - Establish scalable, efficient, automated processes for large-scale data analysis
    and model development/serving
  - Research and implement innovative machine learning approaches including cutting-edge
    AI research
  - Mentor and recruit AI/ML scientists and machine learning engineers to the team
  - Present findings and insights to senior leadership and pursue IP submissions
  use_cases:
  - Healthcare data analysis and modeling for business value insights
  - Machine learning solutions for UnitedHealthcare and Optum business units (Financial,
    Health, Insight, Rx)
  - AI-powered healthcare journey transformation and patient care improvement
  - Enterprise AI/ML development platform development and support
  - Complex healthcare system optimization through advanced analytics
  - Multimodal and NLP applications for healthcare data processing
