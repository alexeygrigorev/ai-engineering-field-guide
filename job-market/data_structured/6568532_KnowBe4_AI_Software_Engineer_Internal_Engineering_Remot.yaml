    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work building LLM agents, RAG
      systems, and deploying AI models to production. The engineer
      designs and implements AI/ML models, builds guardrails for
      hallucination detection, and integrates AI components across
      the full stack.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop AI-powered applications by integrating front-end, back-end, and machine
    learning components
  - Design and implement AI/ML models and APIs to meet business and technical requirements
  - Build and maintain data pipelines for training, deploying, and monitoring models
  - Deploy applications and AI models to cloud platforms (AWS) with CI/CD pipelines
  - Build LLM agents and toolsets to streamline/automate business needs
  - Identify edge cases where LLMs struggle and set up automated systems for catching
    hallucinations
  - Design, optimize, and test RAG systems for LLM search using embeddings and custom
    search techniques
  use_cases:
  - LLM agents for automating business processes and streamlining workflows
  - RAG systems for enhanced search using embeddings and custom techniques
  - Automated systems for detecting and catching LLM hallucinations and unexpected
    behavior
  - Microservices for audio file conversion, denoising, and transcription
  - AI-powered full-stack applications integrating machine learning models with user-facing
    interfaces
