      This is a hands-on builder role responsible for designing,
      developing, and deploying agentic AI solutions directly. The
      role involves building multi-agent systems using LangChain,
      LangGraph, Autogen, and CrewAI, implementing RAG pipelines,
      and integrating LLMs/SLMs - all core AI engineering work
      focused on building and deploying AI models and agents.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and deploy multi-agent systems using frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph,
    Autogen, CrewAI, and LlamaIndex
  - Develop custom agents for document processing, workflow automation, SDLC acceleration,
    data analysis, and business process orchestration
  - Integrate LLMs, SLMs, embeddings, and retrieval pipelines with enterprise systems
    like SharePoint, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and databases
  - Create and operate LLM/ML endpoints, agent memory/state stores, and event-driven
    triggers using Python, Kafka, EventBridge, Airflow, and AWS services
  - Implement monitoring, metrics, guardrails, and automated testing for multi-agent
    systems to ensure production reliability
  - Work directly with clients to translate business needs into technical agent designs
    and execution roadmaps
  - Apply enterprise standards for data security, access control, auditing, model
    governance, and safe AI usage
  - Coach junior engineers on agent design patterns, RAG, orchestration, and clean
    engineering practices
  use_cases:
  - Document intelligence for processing and analyzing enterprise documents
  - Service desk automation using agents to handle support workflows
  - Coding automation and SDLC acceleration through AI-assisted development tools
  - Operations automation and business process orchestration across enterprise systems
  - Decision support systems using RAG and tool-calling for data-driven insights
  - Real-time and batch workflow automation connecting agents to enterprise data sources
