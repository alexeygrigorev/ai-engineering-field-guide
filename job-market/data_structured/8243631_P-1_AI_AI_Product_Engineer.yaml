      This is a research-meets-production role building core AI
      capabilities, including training, adapting, and deploying
      large language models and building new agentic behaviors.
      The engineer works directly on model development and agent
      implementation, not just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Train, adapt, and deploy large language models for engineering applications
  - Build new agentic behaviors and capabilities for Archie the AI engineer
  - Integrate AI systems with industry-standard engineering tools
  - Collaborate with AI researchers and domain experts to translate ML research into
    production systems
  - Develop core AI capabilities that enable quantitative intuition over physical
    product domains
  - Work in a research-meets-production environment turning cutting-edge ML into real
    engineering systems
  use_cases:
  - AI engineer capable of quantitative intuition over physical product domains
  - Automating engineering tool use for physical product design
  - Assisting entry-level design engineering work with AI capabilities
  - Deploying AI engineering systems to industrial manufacturing companies
  - Integrating AI with industry-standard engineering design workflows
