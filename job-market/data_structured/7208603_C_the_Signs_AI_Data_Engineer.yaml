      The role focuses on building data pipelines, cleaning and
      structuring data for LLMs and ML models, but does not
      involve actually building, training, fine-tuning, or
      deploying models. The engineer provides the foundational
      data infrastructure and high-quality datasets that enable ML
      engineers to work on models.
  responsibilities:
  - Collaborate with data scientists and ML engineers to understand data requirements
    for LLM and machine learning model fine-tuning
  - Design, build, and maintain scalable data pipelines to ingest, process, and store
    massive and diverse healthcare datasets
  - Implement robust data validation, cleaning, and transformation processes to ensure
    data quality and integrity for training datasets
  - Develop and optimize data structures and schemas for efficient access and utilization
    by LLMs and machine learning models
  - Work with the team to identify and acquire new data sources, ensuring compliance
    with healthcare regulations like HIPAA
  - Monitor data pipeline performance, troubleshoot issues, and implement optimizations
    to improve efficiency and reliability
  use_cases:
  - Healthcare data processing for LLM training and fine-tuning
  - Healthcare AI applications impacting patient outcomes
  - Large-scale healthcare data ingestion and transformation
  - Data pipeline infrastructure for machine learning workflows
  - Compliant healthcare data management and storage
