    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is a Principal AI/ML Engineer role that involves hands-
      on work across the entire model lifecycle including
      training, fine-tuning, deployment, and optimization of LLMs
      and generative models. The role requires expertise in ML
      frameworks (PyTorch, Transformers, vLLM, Llama-factory,
      Megatron-LM), GPU acceleration, and direct productionization
      of models, which clearly places this in the ai-first
      category.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect, build, and scale the end-to-end ML Ops pipeline including training,
    fine-tuning, evaluation, rollout, and monitoring
  - Design reliable infrastructure for model deployment, versioning, reproducibility,
    and orchestration across cloud and on-prem GPU clusters
  - Optimize compute usage across distributed systems including Kubernetes, autoscaling,
    caching, GPU allocation, and checkpointing workflows
  - Lead the implementation of observability for ML systems to monitor drift, performance,
    throughput, reliability, and cost
  - Build automated workflows for dataset curation, labeling, feature pipelines, evaluation,
    and CI/CD for ML models
  - Collaborate with researchers to productionize models and accelerate training and
    inference pipelines
  - Establish ML Ops best practices, internal standards, and cross-team tooling
  - Mentor engineers and influence architectural direction across the entire AI platform
  use_cases:
  - Deploying large-scale generative AI models and LLMs in production environments
  - Optimizing training and inference pipelines for AI systems serving Fortune 500
    clients
  - Managing distributed GPU clusters for model training and serving at enterprise
    scale
  - Implementing observability and monitoring for production ML systems to ensure
    reliability and performance
  - Building automated ML workflows for model lifecycle management including fine-tuning
    and evaluation
