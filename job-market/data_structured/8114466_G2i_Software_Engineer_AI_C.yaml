    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves working directly ON AI/LLM systems
      through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback),
      ranking code snippets, providing feedback to train models,
      and refactoring AI-generated code. The employee is actively
      involved in the training pipeline that tunes the model's
      behavior, which constitutes hands-on AI model development
      work.
  responsibilities:
  - Compare and rank multiple code snippets, explaining which is best and why
  - Repair and refactor AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and style
  - Inject feedback including ratings, edits, and test results into the RLHF pipeline
  - Maintain smooth operation of the RLHF feedback loop for model training
  - Provide detailed justifications for code review decisions to train model reasoning
  - Identify logic errors, performance traps, and security issues in AI-generated
    code
  use_cases:
  - Training LLMs to write production-grade code across multiple programming languages
  - Teaching models to propose, critique, and improve code through expert feedback
  - Improving AI code generation quality through reinforcement learning
  - Converting human code review feedback into reward signals for model tuning
  - Enhancing model ability to generate code that meets production standards
