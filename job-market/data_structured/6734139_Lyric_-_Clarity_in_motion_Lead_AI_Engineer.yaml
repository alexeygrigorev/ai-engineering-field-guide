position:
  title: Lead AI Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves directly building, fine-tuning, and
      deploying LLMs and generative AI models for document
      understanding. The engineer implements RAG systems, works
      with vector databases, and develops NLP pipelines - all
      hands-on work with AI models rather than supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the architecture, development, and deployment of AI/ML systems for document
    ingestion, understanding, and data extraction
  - Build and fine-tune LLMs and generative AI models to interpret, summarize, and
    extract information from complex unstructured content
  - Develop NLP pipelines leveraging techniques such as OCR, entity recognition, text
    classification, summarization, and semantic parsing
  - Integrate LLMs with retrieval systems (RAG), vector databases, and structured
    outputs suitable for downstream consumption
  - Build and create good datasets and a system of validation and verification of
    data and ML systems
  - Mentor a team of AI/ML engineers, establish best practices in model training,
    evaluation, and monitoring
  - Collaborate cross-functionally to align technical solutions with product requirements
    and compliance needs
  use_cases:
  - Extract and structure data from unstructured documents such as PDFs, scanned forms,
    and free-text content
  - Prevent inaccurate payments and reduce waste in the healthcare ecosystem through
    intelligent document processing
  - Interpret, summarize, and extract information from complex unstructured healthcare
    documents at scale
  - Document understanding and data extraction for healthcare payer and provider workflows
  - Pre-payment accuracy and integrity through AI-powered document analysis
