    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a QA Engineer role focused on building testing and
      evaluation frameworks to benchmark AI performance against
      engineering standards. The role designs evals to measure AI
      system progress and prevent regressions, but does not
      involve building, training, fine-tuning, or deploying the AI
      models themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement automated evaluation frameworks to benchmark Archie's engineering
    capabilities
  - Translate engineering judgment into scalable testing systems
  - Ensure AI is learning the right things and prevent regressions as the system evolves
  - Collaborate with AI researchers, software engineers, and domain experts on evals
  - Operate testing systems that define whether the AI is becoming a better engineer
  - Shape how progress toward engineering AGI is measured through evaluation systems
  use_cases:
  - AI engineer performing quantitative intuition over physical product domains
  - AI agent performing engineering tool use at entry-level design engineer capability
  - Evaluation system benchmarking AI against real-world engineering skill expectations
  - Automated assessment of AI learning progress in engineering domains
  - Preventing capability regressions in evolving AI engineering system
