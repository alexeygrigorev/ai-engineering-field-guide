      This is a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) MLOps role focused
      on infrastructure, platform, and operations support for
      AI/ML teams. The responsibilities include building CI/CD
      pipelines, managing Kubernetes clusters, setting up
      monitoring/logging, and maintaining infrastructure - all
      supporting AI workloads rather than directly building,
      training, or deploying models themselves. The role bridges
      research and production but operates the infrastructure
      platform rather than the AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Work closely with AI/ML engineers and researchers to design and architect AI/ML
    applications for scale and reliability, and deploy CI/CD pipelines for safe reproducible
    experiments
  - Troubleshoot production issues across AI/ML application code and infrastructure
    configurations
  - Set up and manage monitoring, logging, and alerting systems for extensive training
    runs and client-facing APIs
  - Ensure training environments are consistently available and prepared across multiple
    clusters
  - Develop and manage containerization and orchestration systems using Docker and
    Kubernetes
  - Operate and oversee large Kubernetes clusters with GPU workloads
  use_cases:
  - Cloud security platform following and protecting data wherever it goes
  - ML model training infrastructure supporting PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers
  - LLM deployment and optimization using TensorRT
  - Large-scale distributed AI/ML applications requiring high-performance infrastructure
