      This is a hands-on AI engineering role focused on building,
      deploying, and optimizing AI agents and agentic systems. The
      responsibilities include direct work with LLMs, RAG
      implementations, agent frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex),
      and end-to-end model deployment - not just infrastructure or
      support for AI teams.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and ship agentic workflows across multiple domains including research
    agents, coding assistants, conversational agents, reasoning agents, scheduling
    agents, analytics agents, and workflow automation bots
  - Own the end-to-end lifecycle from data ingestion through reasoning, action taking,
    evaluation, and monitoring
  - Build multi-step agents capable of autonomous planning, context tracking, memory,
    tool use, and API orchestration using modern agent stacks
  - Architect robust retrieval pipelines (RAG), vector embeddings, caching layers,
    and knowledge grounding systems
  - Deploy agents as microservices with proper observability, evaluations, guardrails,
    and fallbacks while optimizing inference cost, latency, accuracy, and task-completion
    rates
  - Drive technical and architectural decisions to meet product requirements while
    anticipating and designing for future needs
  - Mentor junior developers and participate in code reviews to ensure high-quality
    software development
  - Communicate directly with Product Owners to ensure requirements and specifications
    are understood and properly implemented
  use_cases:
  - Research agents for automated information gathering and analysis
  - Coding assistants and developer productivity tools
  - Conversational AI agents for voice and text interactions
  - Workflow automation bots for operational efficiency
  - Analytics agents for data processing and insights generation
  - Scheduling agents for task and resource management
