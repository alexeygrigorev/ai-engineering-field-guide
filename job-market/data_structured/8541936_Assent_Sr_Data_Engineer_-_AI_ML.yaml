    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves direct hands-on work building AI systems,
      specifically designing and implementing RAG/RAQ pipelines,
      knowledge bases, vector stores, and data infrastructures for
      agentic AI systems. The engineer works on embedding
      generation, semantic chunking, and retrieval orchestration -
      all core components of AI/ML system development.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and optimize data pipelines for Agentic and Generative AI systems
    enabling context retrieval and multi-step reasoning
  - Develop and manage knowledge bases, vector stores, and graph databases for regulatory,
    product, and supplier data
  - Engineer retrieval-augmented reasoning pipelines integrating embedding generation
    and contextual chunking for LLM-driven agents
  - Implement and automate workflows for ingesting structured and unstructured content
    into searchable data stores
  - Design feedback and reinforcement loops allowing AI agents to validate and refine
    knowledge sources
  - Integrate monitoring and observability to measure retrieval performance and model-data
    alignment for deployed agents
  use_cases:
  - Supply chain sustainability compliance and risk management
  - Enterprise knowledge retrieval and reasoning for regulatory data
  - Autonomous AI agents for product and supplier domain analysis
  - Document and email understanding through semantic search
  - Multi-step reasoning on complex supply chain and regulatory information
  - Dynamic knowledge graph updates for continuous AI agent learning
