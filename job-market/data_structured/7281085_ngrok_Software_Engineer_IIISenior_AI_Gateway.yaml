    Cloud networking platform for secure traffic routing and AI
    gateway
position:
  title: Software Engineer III/Senior, AI Gateway
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves building gateway infrastructure and
      policy enforcement systems that sit in front of AI
      workloads, rather than building, training, or deploying
      AI/ML models themselves. The engineer works on traffic
      classification, usage tracking, rate limiting, and
      observability for AI traffic - all of which are
      infrastructure/support systems that enable AI workloads but
      don't involve direct model work.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and evolve AI-aware gateway components that classify and handle AI traffic
    in real-time in the request path
  - Design and implement AI Gateway Traffic Policy Objects including rate limits,
    usage caps, and access rules specific to AI workloads
  - Build and maintain systems that accurately measure AI usage including requests,
    tokens, and related metadata for customer visibility
  - Expose clear, trustworthy signals around AI traffic behavior showing what was
    allowed or blocked and which policies were applied
  - Design AI-specific gateway primitives and abstractions that feel intentional and
    safe without exposing provider quirks or infrastructure details
  - Collaborate with Gateway, Customer Data, and Platform teams to ensure AI usage
    data, policy enforcement, and billing signals are properly aligned
  use_cases:
  - AI traffic identification and control at the gateway layer with real-time policy
    enforcement
  - Preventing runaway AI costs and misuse through rate limits, usage caps, and access
    rules
  - Tracking and measuring AI token consumption and usage patterns for cost observability
  - Explaining AI traffic behavior by showing which policies were applied and why
    requests were allowed or blocked
  - Providing secure routing and transformation for AI inference workloads in production
