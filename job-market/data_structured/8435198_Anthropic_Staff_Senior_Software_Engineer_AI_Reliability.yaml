    reasoning: |-
      This is an AI Reliability Engineering role focused on
      infrastructure, observability, and incident response for LLM
      serving systems. The engineer builds monitoring systems,
      ensures high availability, and operates serving
      infrastructure rather than building, training, or fine-
      tuning models themselves. They support the reliability of AI
      systems without directly working on the AI/ML models or
      agents.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop appropriate Service Level Objectives for large language model serving
    systems, balancing availability and latency with development velocity
  - Design and implement monitoring and observability systems across the token path
  - Assist in the design and implementation of high-availability serving infrastructure
    across multiple regions and cloud providers
  - Lead incident response for critical AI services, ensuring rapid recovery, thorough
    incident reviews, and systematic improvements
  - Support the reliability of safeguard model serving critical for site reliability
    and safety commitments
  use_cases:
  - Large-scale language model serving infrastructure
  - High-availability AI service delivery across multiple regions and cloud providers
  - Safeguard model serving for safety commitments
  - Real-time token path monitoring and observability
  - Incident management and rapid recovery for critical AI services
