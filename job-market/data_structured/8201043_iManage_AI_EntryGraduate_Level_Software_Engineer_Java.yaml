      While the role is titled "AI Software Engineer" and involves
      working with AI features, the responsibilities focus on
      general software engineering: building production software,
      CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes deployment, monitoring, and
      scaling systems. The role collaborates with knowledge
      engineering teams and deploys AI features rather than
      building, training, or fine-tuning models directly. This
      places it as enabling AI work rather than hands-on model
      development.
  responsibilities:
  - Building high-quality, maintainable, well-tested software for production environments
  - Enforcing strong standards around monitoring, observability, and integration testing
  - Designing systems that scale reliably and perform under real-world load
  - Keeping pace with emerging AI/ML technologies and evaluating where they add value
  - Deploying and operating services using Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, GitHub Actions,
    and CI/CD pipelines
  - Taking ownership of projects from early concept to shipped feature
  use_cases:
  - Intelligent document management and knowledge work platform
  - AI-powered capabilities for professional content and communications
  - Cloud-native SaaS platform serving 4,100+ customers managing 11 billion documents
  - Scalable document management with 11 petabytes of data
  - LLM-powered or AI-driven features for end users
