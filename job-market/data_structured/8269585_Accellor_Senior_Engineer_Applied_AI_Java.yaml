      This role involves hands-on work building and deploying
      AI/ML systems including RAG patterns, AI agents, agentic
      workflows, and LLM-based applications. The engineer directly
      implements generative AI technologies using frameworks like
      LangChain4j and Spring AI, working on model integration and
      agent orchestration rather than just supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and maintain scalable microservices using Java and Spring Boot
    to power AI-enabled applications
  - Build and integrate AI agents and agentic workflows that orchestrate tools, APIs,
    reasoning steps, and business logic
  - Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) patterns, Model Context Protocol
    (MCP) integrations, and agent skills
  - Leverage knowledge graphs and vector databases to enhance reasoning, entity relationships,
    and context retrieval
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to translate business needs into technical
    AI solutions
  - Participate in code reviews and mentor junior engineers on AI and agentic workflow
    skills
  - Drive continuous improvement by exploring new models, frameworks, and reasoning
    techniques
  - Contribute to engineering best practices for reliability, safety, governance,
    and monitoring of production AI systems
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise workflow automation using AI agents and intelligent assistants
  - Document intelligence systems for processing and analyzing enterprise documents
  - Decision support systems leveraging AI reasoning and knowledge graphs
  - RAG-enhanced applications for context-aware information retrieval
  - Agentic workflows orchestrating multiple tools and APIs for complex business processes
