position:
  title: Senior ML Engineer (LLM, Agentic AI)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves directly building and deploying LLM-based
      systems including fine-tuning models, implementing RAG, and
      creating agentic workflows with LangGraph. The engineer owns
      model deployment, evaluation, and optimization - hands-on
      work with AI systems rather than supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Integrate and fine-tune LLMs for natural-language understanding, reasoning, and
    multi-step tool orchestration
  - Build agentic workflows using LangGraph to coordinate complex tasks across data
    sources and services
  - Architect and implement AI/ML features for pattern recognition, entity extraction,
    and automated intelligence gathering at scale
  - Develop scalable data pipelines and streaming architectures that process billions
    of heterogeneous data points
  - Create and optimize vector databases and retrieval systems for semantic search
    and RAG
  - Deliver production-ready APIs and microservices supporting real-time analysis
    and model inference
  - Own model deployment and monitoring using modern ML/LLMOps practices with focus
    on accuracy, latency, and cost
  - Evaluate LLM systems using offline metrics, golden test sets, and prompt A/B tests
  use_cases:
  - Process and analyze large-scale unstructured data for threat intelligence
  - Implement automated pattern recognition and entity extraction for intelligence
    gathering
  - Enable multi-step reasoning and tool orchestration for complex security analysis
  - Provide real-time semantic search and retrieval over intelligence data
  - Support OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) analysis with NLP and computer vision
