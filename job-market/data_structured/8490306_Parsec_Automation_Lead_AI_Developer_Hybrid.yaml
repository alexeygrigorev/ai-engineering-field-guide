      This role is hands-on building production-grade agentic AI
      systems including MCP-based tool ecosystems, agent runtimes,
      and LLM integrations. The primary work involves directly
      implementing and deploying AI agents, tool calling, and
      orchestration - not just supporting AI infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Define the reference architecture for AI capabilities within an on-prem Microsoft
    stack including ASP.NET and SQL Server
  - Design and implement production-grade agent runtime integrated into web and service
    layers with policy controls and auditability
  - Build agent/orchestrator services to manage conversation state, tool routing,
    retries, timeouts, and step limits
  - Integrate with hosted LLM providers using function/tool calling patterns and response
    quality guardrails
  - Establish patterns for MCP servers/clients, tool contracts, versioning, and backward
    compatibility
  - Build locally hosted MCP tool servers to securely access SQL Server, REST APIs,
    and file/report generation subsystems
  - Implement safety boundaries, validation layers, human-in-the-loop workflows, and
    secure-by-design principles
  - Build comprehensive observability with structured logging, tracing, metrics, and
    dashboards
  use_cases:
  - Manufacturing operations management and MES platform automation
  - Agent-based conversational interfaces for manufacturing data access and analysis
  - Secure SQL database querying via natural language through agent tools
  - Human-in-the-loop approval workflows for sensitive manufacturing operations
  - Automated report and document generation from manufacturing systems
