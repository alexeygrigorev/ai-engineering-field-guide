  - Design, train, and optimize ML models using PyTorch or TensorFlow for production-grade
    applications
  - Build scalable data pipelines for feature engineering and model training using
    distributed computing frameworks
  - Develop and maintain ML workflows using Airflow, Kedro, and MLflow for reproducibility
    and traceability
  - Automate model deployment and lifecycle management across dev, staging, and production
    environments
  - Implement model drift detection, performance tracking, and automated retraining
    strategies
  - Collaborate with business and analytics teams to design dashboards and visualizations
    for actionable insights
  - Ensure data quality, consistency, and compliance with governance standards for
    large-scale datasets
  use_cases:
  - Healthcare payment accuracy and pre-pay editing
  - Preventing inaccurate payments in healthcare claims
  - Reducing waste in the healthcare ecosystem
  - Optimizing resource use to reduce cost of care
  - Monitoring model performance and business impact through KPIs
  - Delivering actionable insights to stakeholders from ML outputs
