    reasoning: |-
      This is a backend engineering role focused on building
      infrastructure and data pipelines that support AI/ML
      workloads, not on building, training, or deploying models
      directly. The role partners with AI/ML teams to bring models
      into production, but the hands-on work is on backend
      systems, APIs, and data processing that enable AI
      capabilities.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and implement AI-native backend infrastructure including scalable data
    pipelines and intelligent services
  - Partner with AI/ML teams to bring machine learning models and LLMs into production
    at scale
  - Build infrastructure that powers real-time AI applications and intelligent APIs
  - Develop high-throughput systems that support AI/ML workloads and model inference
    pipelines
  - Design modular, scalable architectures that support AI system evolution over time
  - Contribute to performance monitoring, testing, and reliability best practices
    in AI systems
  use_cases:
  - Real-time AI applications and intelligent APIs
  - Large-scale model inference pipelines
  - Automated decision-making workflows
  - Advanced analytics and machine learning workflows
  - Software visibility and security insights
