  title: Senior Full-Stack Engineer - Physical AI
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a full-stack engineering role building data
      infrastructure and tooling for Physical AI applications
      (robotics, autonomous vehicles). The role focuses on data
      acquisition, 3D rendering, annotation tools, and web-scale
      data processing - not building, training, or deploying AI
      models. While working with ML models is mentioned, it's in
      the context of integrating them into a broader data platform
      rather than direct model development.
  responsibilities:
  - Build tools for the full Physical AI data stack including data acquisition, ingestion,
    and curation at scale
  - Develop 3D rendering, annotation, and verification capabilities for visual and
    sensor data
  - Solve problems of large-scale efficient data transfer and storage for complex
    domain modeling
  - Apply machine learning models and optimize performance in web browsers for 3D
    scenes with thousands of objects
  - Take end-to-end ownership from architectural decisions through deployment, monitoring,
    and impact measurement
  - Work across the full stack covering deployment, styling, and everything in between
  use_cases:
  - Data quality management for robotics and autonomous vehicles training
  - Large-scale data annotation and curation for computer vision applications
  - 3D scene rendering and visualization for spatial and sensor data
  - Physical AI data infrastructure across healthcare, surveillance, retail, and agriculture
  - Training data preparation and verification for computer vision and deep learning
