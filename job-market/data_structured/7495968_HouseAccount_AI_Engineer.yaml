    reasoning: |-
      This role involves building, fine-tuning, and deploying AI
      systems including agents, RAG implementations, and automated
      workflows using LLMs. The engineer will work directly with
      OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, LangChain, and vector databases to
      create intelligent systems for the home services platform.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, prototype, and deploy intelligent systems that power matching, messaging,
    and management of home services
  - Build and fine-tune workflows with OpenAI APIs, Anthropic Claude, or Mistral models
  - Use frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, or Vercel AI SDK to connect multiple
    models and data sources
  - Design retrieval and memory systems that help agents reason across internal data
    including CRM, outreach logs, and provider data
  - Prototype automations using Zapier, n8n, or custom Python/Ruby scripts before
    productizing them
  - Collaborate with engineering to connect model outputs to the Rails app via clean
    APIs
  - Experiment with prompt architectures, tool use, and context management to improve
    performance and accuracy
  - Build and scale agentic systems that make operations and product smarter
  use_cases:
  - Match homeowners to trusted local service providers using AI-powered matching
    systems
  - Automate repetitive workflows and convert them into smart agents that scale daily
    operations
  - Enable agents to reason across internal data sources including CRM, outreach logs,
    and provider data
  - Create intelligent messaging and management systems for home service bookings
  - Transform messy real-world home service processes into structured logic for AI
    automation
