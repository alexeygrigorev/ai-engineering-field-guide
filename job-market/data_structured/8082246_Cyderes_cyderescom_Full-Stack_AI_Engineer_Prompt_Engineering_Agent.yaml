  title: Full-Stack AI Engineer (Prompt Engineering & Agentic Systems) Python, Azure
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is hands-on AI engineering focused on building,
      deploying, and optimizing agentic AI systems, RAG pipelines,
      and multi-agent workflows. The engineer works directly with
      prompt engineering, agent frameworks, model fine-tuning, and
      AI service integration rather than just supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, test, and optimize enterprise-grade prompts, system instructions, schemas,
    and agent workflows
  - Build multi-step agentic pipelines, self-refining loops, and deterministic fallback
    logic
  - Implement PromptOps including versioning, evaluations, regression testing, hallucination
    mitigation, and token optimization
  - Build RAG pipelines, vector search, memory layers, and grounding strategies
  - Build and maintain Python-based microservices using FastAPI with async patterns
    and REST APIs
  - Deliver full-stack AI applications using React and TypeScript for multi-turn AI
    interactions
  - Deploy AI workloads on Azure App Services, Functions, AKS, Logic Apps, and Event
    Grid
  - Support model selection, fine-tuning strategies, safety constraints, and evaluation
    frameworks
  use_cases:
  - Agentic AI systems for cybersecurity operations
  - RAG-powered enterprise search and knowledge retrieval
  - Multi-turn AI interactions for security analysts
  - Automated threat detection and response workflows
  - AI-augmented security operations and automation
