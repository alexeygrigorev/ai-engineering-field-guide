      This role involves hands-on work building AI systems -
      implementing backend services for intelligent agent
      workflows, integrating LLMs, and developing RAG systems. The
      engineer will build orchestration layers that combine LLMs
      with vector databases and autonomous infrastructure actions,
      not just support infrastructure for AI teams.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement backend services that enable intelligent agent workflows
    and autonomous infrastructure actions
  - Develop APIs and orchestration layers integrating LLMs, vector databases, and
    observability pipelines
  - Build scalable systems to support LLM-based reasoning, retrieval, and decision-making
    across cloud infrastructure
  - Integrate with AWS Bedrock and other LLM platforms to support multi-model capabilities
  - Develop data access and semantic search layers using vector databases
  - Build robust monitoring, testing, and CI/CD systems to ensure reliability of AI
    workflows
  - Collaborate with product and DevOps teams on architecture design, deployments,
    and system health monitoring
  - Write clean, maintainable code with strong adherence to security and performance
    best practices
  use_cases:
  - Agentic AI platform for intelligent infrastructure automation
  - Autonomous infrastructure actions powered by LLM-based reasoning
  - Retrieval-augmented generation for semantic search across enterprise infrastructure
    data
  - Multi-model AI orchestration supporting various LLM providers
  - Enterprise IT and managed service provider automation through intelligent agents
