  stage: early-stage
  focus: AI-driven commercial real estate lease management platform
position:
  title: Senior Data Engineer (AI)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building data pipelines and
      infrastructure that support AI work rather than directly
      building or fine-tuning ML models. The engineer designs ELT
      workflows, orchestrates LLM API calls, and creates data
      validation frameworks - all enabling AI functionality rather
      than developing the AI models themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and iterate data extraction and transformation pipelines that convert unstructured
    leasing documents into structured JSON stores
  - Write and optimize LLM API calls and prompts to extract and interpret text data
    at scale
  - Orchestrate AI-driven workflows integrating multiple LLM models to handle diverse
    document types and edge cases
  - Build and maintain ELT workflows in Python, managing data flows between cloud
    storage and relational databases
  - Develop data quality and validation frameworks to ensure structured outputs are
    accurate and production-ready
  - Implement monitoring, alerting, and automated quality checks across extraction
    pipelines
  use_cases:
  - Automate complex commercial real estate lease negotiation and management workflows
  - Extract structured data from unstructured leasing documents using AI-driven techniques
  - Generate market-aligned insights from lease data for real estate teams
  - Streamline proposal generation for commercial real estate deals
  - Transform messy real-world documents into clean, reliable JSON for web applications
