      This role focuses on human feedback (RLHF) for code
      evaluation - ranking, reviewing, and critiquing AI-generated
      code to train models. The work is NOT building, training, or
      deploying models but providing data and feedback signals
      that enable model training by others.
  responsibilities:
  - Compare and rank multiple code snippets while explaining which is best and why
  - Repair and refactor AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and style
  - Inject feedback including ratings, edits, and test results into the RLHF pipeline
  - Identify logic errors, performance traps, and security issues through code review
  - Provide detailed explanations justifying why one approach is better than another
  - Maintain smooth operation of the RLHF feedback pipeline
  use_cases:
  - Training large language models to write production-grade code across multiple
    programming languages
  - Generating reward signals from human code evaluations to improve model performance
  - Teaching models to propose, critique, and improve code like expert engineers
  - Evaluating code correctness and style through human feedback reinforcement learning
