      The role requires hands-on experience fine-tuning LLMs,
      training models, building multimodal AI systems, and
      deploying them to production using PEFT, LoRA, and prompt
      engineering. This is direct model development and deployment
      work, not enabling infrastructure or support for other AI
      engineers.
  responsibilities:
  - Fine-tune LLMs and ML models for healthcare-specific use cases using PEFT, LoRA,
    and prompt engineering
  - Build multimodal AI systems integrating text, structured medical data, and images
    with STT/TTS models
  - Lead end-to-end model deployment with cloud-native infrastructure and implement
    performance monitoring and auto-retraining pipelines
  - Process and curate large-scale healthcare datasets while ensuring HIPAA and GDPR
    compliance
  - Develop bias mitigation strategies and robust evaluation frameworks combining
    technical KPIs with clinical relevance
  - Provide technical guidance and drive adoption of best practices in model reproducibility,
    validation, and explainability
  use_cases:
  - Voice assistants and conversational AI interfaces for healthcare settings
  - Multimodal AI systems integrating text, medical data, and images for patient care
  - Healthcare precision care technology connecting clinical insight with patient
    engagement
  - AI-powered care orchestration for health systems and providers
  - STT/TTS integration for voice-enabled healthcare products
