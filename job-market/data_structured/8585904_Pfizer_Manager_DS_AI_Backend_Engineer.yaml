      This role involves hands-on work building and deploying AI
      agents, including implementing multi-step reasoning, tool-
      execution loops, RAG pipelines, and LLM integrations. The

  - Develop state and memory systems for agent context and knowledge retention
  - Design and optimize RAG pipelines and retrieval infrastructure
  - Integrate LLMs with APIs, tools, databases, and external systems
  - Implement guardrails, validation layers, retry logic, and failure-handling mechanisms
  - Architect scalable, fault-tolerant backend systems with observability and logging
  - Deploy and maintain services using Docker, CI/CD, and cloud environments
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous AI agents with multi-step reasoning capabilities
  - RAG-based knowledge retrieval and question answering
  - LLM-powered tool integration and workflow automation
  - AI-driven commercial process optimization at Pfizer
  - Enterprise AI solutions for marketing and business operations
