      The role directly builds, deploys, and architects AI Agent
      systems, including multi-agent orchestration frameworks, RAG
      implementations, and agent platforms. This is hands-on work
      with GenAI technology, not infrastructure support for other
      AI practitioners.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and implement complex, multi-agent orchestration frameworks and sophisticated
    AI Agents that autonomously handle business and scientific workflows
  - Design and build the core internal developer platforms and shared libraries that
    standardize agent deployment with security and governance
  - Drive the strategy for autonomous operations and infrastructure-as-code, engineering
    self-healing systems that manage configuration, identity, and system health
  - Establish the observability standards (LLMOps) required to debug non-deterministic
    AI behaviors and conduct systemic root cause analyses
  - Partner with cross-functional leadership to translate high-level business goals
    into technical architectures for AI workflow restructuring
  - Serve as a technical leader for the AI Agent stack through architectural decision
    records, code reviews, and mentorship
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous handling of business and scientific workflows within the TechBio space
  - Internal operational automation to eliminate toil and drive operational velocity
  - Self-healing systems that manage configuration, identity, and system health with
    minimal human intervention
  - Integration of AI agents with sensitive data and legacy systems for enterprise
    automation
  - IT Engineering platform that enables the wider organization to self-serve automations
