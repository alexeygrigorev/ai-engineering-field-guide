    reasoning: |-
      This is a Solutions Engineer role at a billing platform
      company that sells TO AI companies rather than building AI
      systems. The role focuses on technical sales,
      implementation, and customer success - helping AI companies
      implement usage-based billing infrastructure through demos,
      POCs, and integrations, not building or deploying AI models.

  - Own the technical sales cycle from discovery through technical win, driving deals
    with AI-first companies
  - Conduct efficient discovery to understand billing challenges, product launch timelines,
    and technical requirements
  - Run streamlined demos tailored to technical founders and product/engineering teams
    at AI companies
  - Provide hands-on implementation support including code snippets, configuration
    examples, and integration guides
  - Design pragmatic upstream/downstream integrations into prospect systems to accelerate
    time-to-value
  - Build deep AI market expertise and provide consultative guidance on pricing and
    packaging strategies for LLM providers and generative AI companies
  - Develop relationships with technical stakeholders across engineering, product,
    and finance organizations at AI companies
  use_cases:
  - Usage-based billing implementation for AI-first companies launching products on
    tight timelines
  - Monetization strategy and pricing model design for LLM providers and generative
    AI companies
  - Billing infrastructure for AI companies offering consumption-based products across
    image, video, audio, and tooling markets
  - Integration of billing platforms with customer systems for tracking and invoicing
    AI usage metrics
  - Streamlined quote-to-cash workflows for high-velocity AI companies needing rapid
    product launches
