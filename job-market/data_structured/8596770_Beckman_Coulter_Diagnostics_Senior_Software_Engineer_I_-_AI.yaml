      The role involves hands-on work designing and implementing
      low-level code for training and fine-tuning RAG models using
      OpenAI LLMs, which directly involves building and deploying
      AI/ML models. Additionally, the position requires developing
      Python applications for predictive analytics and integrating
      AI models with enterprise data sources, which qualifies as
      working directly ON AI systems rather than supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop, test, and deploy custom Python applications for predictive analytics,
    process automation, and data-driven decision support to solve real-world problems
    in biotech
  - Design, implement, and optimize low-level code for training and fine-tuning RAG
    models using OpenAI LLMs and related frameworks
  - Integrate AI models with enterprise data sources, ensuring robust, scalable, and
    secure solutions
  - Design, code, and test custom applications and scripts using industry-standard
    development systems and practices
  - Deliver functionality according to technical specifications to achieve expected
    business outcomes
  use_cases:
  - Predictive analytics for biotech applications
  - Process automation and optimization
  - Data-driven decision support systems
  - RAG-based AI solutions with enterprise data integration
  - Real-world problem solving in biotechnology and life sciences
