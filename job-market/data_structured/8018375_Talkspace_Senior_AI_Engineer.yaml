      This is a hands-on role building autonomous AI agents and
      multi-agent systems directly using LLMs for reasoning,
      planning, and RAG. The role involves fine-tuning models,
      implementing agent architectures, and deploying AI systems
      in production.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement technical architecture for autonomous AI agents including
    planning modules, memory/retrieval systems, and tool-use orchestration
  - Apply reinforcement learning and inverse RL methods to develop adaptive, long-term
    intervention strategies that maximize positive user outcomes while minimizing
    risk
  - Select, fine-tune, and deploy foundation models (LLMs) to power agent reasoning,
    natural language understanding, and empathetic communication
  - Develop models for human-agent interaction incorporating principles from cognitive
    science and behavioral economics
  - Construct robust simulation environments for pre-training and testing agent policies
    across psychological and behavioral scenarios
  - Design and implement comprehensive evaluation pipelines including trace-level
    analysis, offline evaluation, real-time monitoring for behavioral drift, and guardrails
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous AI agents providing behavioral health interventions and therapy support
  - Multi-agent systems using LLMs for reasoning, planning, and goal-setting in mental
    health contexts
  - Adaptive intervention strategies that optimize interaction sequencing, timing,
    and content to maximize positive user outcomes
  - Simulated environments for testing and pre-training agent policies across psychological
    scenarios
  - Real-time monitoring and evaluation of agent behavior for safety compliance and
    therapeutic alignment
