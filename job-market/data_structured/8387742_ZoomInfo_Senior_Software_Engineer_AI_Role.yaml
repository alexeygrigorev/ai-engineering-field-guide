    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves directly building, deploying, and
      optimizing LLM-powered agentic AI systems with hands-on work
      on agent frameworks, LLM APIs, function calling, and multi-
      step workflows. The engineer will architect reasoning
      systems and integrate emerging LLM technologies, which is
      core AI development work rather than supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and deploy production-grade agentic AI systems powered by LLMs
  - Build scalable Python services and orchestration pipelines for complex multi-step
    agent workflows
  - Architect frameworks that enable agents to reason, plan, use tools, and execute
    autonomous tasks
  - Integrate LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) into robust, reliable production
    systems
  - Optimize system performance, reliability, and cost-efficiency of LLM-powered applications
  - Evaluate and integrate emerging LLM technologies and agentic patterns into the
    product stack
  - Mentor other engineers and promote best practices in building AI-powered systems
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous AI agents that can reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks
  - LLM-powered applications with tool use and function calling capabilities
  - Agentic systems leveraging language models to solve real-world business challenges
  - AI-ready insights and automation for Go-To-Market intelligence
  - Enterprise-level agentic AI workflows integrated into business operations
