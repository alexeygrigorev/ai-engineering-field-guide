position:
  title: Sr. AI/Machine Learning Engineer - Supply Chain
  ai_type:
    type: ml-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work building, training, and
      deploying traditional ML and statistical models for time
      series forecasting, optimization, and anomaly detection. The
      focus is on classical ML techniques (Prophet, LSTMs) rather
      than modern LLMs/GenAI agents, with direct ownership of
      model development and production deployment.
  responsibilities:
  - Define the end-to-end AI transformation roadmap for supply chain alongside the
    Director, aligning with company OKRs and working closely with executive stakeholders
  - Own the design, training, validation, and deployment of ML and statistical models
    including demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and supplier risk scoring
  - Build predictive models to forecast demand, lead times, and cellular spend across
    Samsara's global supply network
  - Create novel features using large-scale ERP, IoT, and third-party datasets; build
    pipelines and ETL jobs to serve models and stakeholders
  - Deliver production-grade code that supports both batch and real-time inference
    with MLOps best practices
  - Act as the AI liaison to Product, Engineering, Procurement, and Finance—ensuring
    alignment on data requirements, integration, and change management
  - Drive enhancements to data infrastructure and analytics platform to support real-time
    model training, monitoring, and inference at scale
  - Establish governance frameworks, documentation standards, and quality controls
    for model development, validation, and lifecycle management
  use_cases:
  - Demand forecasting across thousands of SKUs with time series models to predict
    future inventory needs
  - Supply risk modeling using real-time IoT signals to identify and mitigate supplier
    vulnerabilities
  - Inventory optimization using predictive analytics to balance stock levels, reduce
    costs, and improve operational efficiency
  - Lead time forecasting to anticipate delays and optimize procurement and logistics
    planning
  - Anomaly detection on large-scale ERP and IoT datasets to identify operational
    issues and opportunities for improvement
  - Cellular spend forecasting to optimize telecommunications costs across the global
    supply network
