      This is a Senior Data Engineer role focused on building data
      pipelines, infrastructure, and platforms to support AI-
      driven molecular design. The responsibilities involve data
      integration, pipeline development, and cloud platform setup
      - all enabling work for AI engineers and scientists rather
      than building or deploying models directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Support data integration efforts by collaborating with scientists, bioinformaticians,
    and AI engineers to ensure data is accessible and well-structured for downstream
    modeling
  - Build and maintain data pipelines to ingest, transform, and store structured and
    unstructured biological data from wet lab experiments, public databases, and internal
    platforms
  - Implement data quality checks and validation routines to ensure reliability and
    reproducibility of datasets used in molecular design workflows
  - Contribute to infrastructure development by assisting in the setup and optimization
    of cloud-based data platforms and tools for scalable storage and compute
  - Document workflows and processes to support reproducibility, collaboration, and
    knowledge sharing across teams
  use_cases:
  - AI-driven molecular design for life sciences and biotechnology applications
  - Processing and integrating biological data including genomic sequences, protein
    structures, and assay results
  - Enabling downstream AI/ML modeling and analysis for research and development in
    diagnostics and life sciences
