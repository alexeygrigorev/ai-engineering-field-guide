      The role involves directly applying LLMs to build
      intelligent features, integrating with multiple LLM
      providers, and managing model selection and routing. While
      it includes platform infrastructure work, the engineer works
      hands-on with LLMs to solve real user problems and directly
      implements AI-powered capabilities, not just supporting
      others who do AI work.

    deployment, orchestration, and lifecycle management of LLMs and other AI models
  - Apply LLMs and other AI technologies directly to build and enhance ClickUp's intelligent
    features, working closely with product and engineering teams
  - Build and maintain robust APIs and backend systems that enable seamless integration
    of AI-powered features into ClickUp's core platform
  - Develop infrastructure for model serving, monitoring, logging, and automated evaluation
    to ensure high reliability and performance of AI services in production
  - Integrate with multiple LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and manage
    model selection, routing, and fallback strategies for optimal performance and
    cost
  - Drive the adoption of best practices in AI privacy, security, and compliance,
    including data anonymization, secure data handling, and regulatory adherence
  - Optimize platform performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency, leveraging cloud-native
    technologies and distributed systems
  - Stay current with advancements in AI infrastructure, MLOps, and LLM applications,
    and proactively incorporate relevant innovations into ClickUp's AI platform
