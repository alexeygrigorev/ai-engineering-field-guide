      This is a software engineering role focused on building
      features that integrate AI/ML capabilities into ClickHouse's
      database platform. The responsibilities involve creating
      APIs, UI/UX implementations, and ecosystem integrations that
      bridge database technology with AI inference services, but
      do not include building, training, or deploying models
      directly. The role involves working with inference APIs and
      vector databases as integrations rather than implementing
      the core AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement AI-powered features across the full stack, from backend inference
    services to frontend interfaces within the ClickHouse Cloud platform
  - Create robust, scalable APIs that connect ClickHouse's database capabilities with
    modern AI/ML inference systems and external/internal AI services
  - Build responsive, intuitive user interfaces that make complex AI functionalities
    accessible to users of all technical backgrounds
  - Implement and maintain integrations with the broader AI/ML ecosystem and standards
    ensuring seamless operation with popular frameworks and tools
  - Integrate models into production systems with proper monitoring, versioning, observability,
    and evaluation
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered data analytics and insights extraction from ClickHouse databases
  - Integration of AI inference capabilities directly within the ClickHouse Cloud
    platform
  - Enhanced data exploration through AI-assisted querying and visualization
  - Seamless connection between high-performance database technology and modern AI/ML
    services
  - User-friendly interfaces for accessing complex AI functionalities within data
    workflows
