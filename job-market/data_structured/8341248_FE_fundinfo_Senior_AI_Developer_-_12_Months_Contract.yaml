      The role involves hands-on building and deploying AI systems
      including agent-based architectures, LLM orchestration, RAG
      pipelines, and LLMOps practices. The engineer directly
      implements multi-step reasoning workflows, tool-calling
      flows, and inference systems rather than just providing
      supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Designing and implementing agent-based AI systems, multi-step reasoning workflows,
    and LLM-orchestrated automation pipelines
  - Building scalable AI services using LLM orchestration frameworks, inference APIs,
    and modern RAG architectures
  - Developing retrieval systems, tool-calling flows, memory management processes,
    and end-to-end RAG pipelines
  - Applying LLMOps/MLOps practices including prompt versioning, evaluation processes,
    monitoring, telemetry, and cost optimization
  - Working with Databricks and MLflow for experimentation, telemetry, and AI observability
  - Developing AI-enabled applications using React, Next.js, Python (FastAPI), or
    .NET Core while integrating AI with enterprise systems
  - Ensuring reliable cloud deployments, CI/CD automation, and production-level operational
    standards across all AI services
  use_cases:
  - Agent-based AI systems for automation and multi-step reasoning
  - RAG-powered applications for information retrieval and knowledge management
  - LLM-orchestrated data processing workflows for fund information analysis
  - AI-enabled investment fund data tools and selection platforms
  - Enterprise search and document analysis using vector embeddings
