      Role involves hands-on work building GenAI systems including
      RAG architectures, vector search, embeddings, LLMs, and
      conversational data exploration features deployed to
      production environments. This is directly working ON AI
      systems, not just supporting AI infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and scale GenAI systems for conversational data exploration, addressing
    real-world biomarker data challenges through production-ready features
  - Design and implement AI-first architectures, including GenAI pipelines, embeddings,
    vector search, and semantic search technologies
  - Make strategic architectural decisions that balance performance, cost, scalability,
    and maintainability across AI systems
  - Continuously improve AI-powered features, optimizing for accuracy, latency, and
    user experience
  - Shape the roadmap for AI experiences, aligning technical innovation with product
    goals and user needs
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams including Product, Design, and Engineering
    teams to design, develop, test, and maintain software applications
  use_cases:
  - Conversational data exploration for biomarker data
  - Semantic search and insight generation for clinical and biospecimen data
  - Automated data management workflows for biotech/pharma R&D teams
  - Enterprise-level sample and biomarker data management solutions
  - Connecting biospecimen, assay, and clinical data sources for integrated analytics
