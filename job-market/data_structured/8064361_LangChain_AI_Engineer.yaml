      This is a hands-on AI engineering role focused on building,
      deploying, and optimizing production AI agent systems. The
      role directly involves implementing agent logic, designing
      evaluation frameworks, optimizing prompts, and implementing
      RAG patterns with LangChain/LangGraph - all core AI/ML
      engineering activities.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement multi-agent systems using Subagents, Handoffs, and Router
    patterns with LangChain/LangGraph
  - Develop comprehensive evaluation frameworks for AI applications using LLM-as-judge
    and deterministic evaluators
  - Optimize agent prompts through A/B testing and externalization techniques
  - Implement state management systems for short-term and long-term memory in agents
  - Design and implement RAG patterns with vector store integration and knowledge
    organization
  - Guide enterprise customers on agent deployment, configuration management, and
    CI/CD pipeline integration
  - Lead agent engineering maturity assessments and provide technical recommendations
    to enterprise customers
  - Set up observability and monitoring using LangSmith for deployed agent systems
  use_cases:
  - Multi-agent systems for enterprise automation using handoffs and routing patterns
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications with vector databases for knowledge
    retrieval
  - Production AI agent deployment with state management and memory capabilities
  - Enterprise AI application evaluation and quality assurance frameworks
  - Customer-specific AI solutions leveraging tool integration and API design
