    reasoning: |-
      This role is a full-stack engineer building product features
      and infrastructure to consume AI-powered insights from an AI
      SRE system. The candidate collaborates with AI
      engineers/researchers to integrate AI solutions into backend
      systems but does not build, train, or deploy models
      themselves. The focus is on product development, API design,
      and infrastructure rather than hands-on AI/ML model work.
  responsibilities:
  - Translate AI-powered insights into user-friendly features that empower engineers
    and reduce cognitive load
  - Innovate and drive the evolution of UX/UI design, rapidly iterating based on user
    feedback to improve overall usability
  - Design and implement high-performance APIs to enable seamless communication between
    backend systems and frontend interfaces
  - Ensure efficient data storage, retrieval, and processing, leveraging technologies
    like PostgreSQL, Redis, or others
  - Collaborate with AI engineers/researchers to integrate AI-driven insights and
    solutions into backend systems
  - Develop intuitive interfaces for presenting and interacting with complex time-series
    and topological data
  use_cases:
  - Real-time incident detection in complex production environments
  - Root cause analysis for production incidents
  - Automated remediation of production incidents
  - Prevention of complex production incidents before they occur
  - AI-powered troubleshooting and site reliability engineering
  - Data visualization for time-series and topological infrastructure data
