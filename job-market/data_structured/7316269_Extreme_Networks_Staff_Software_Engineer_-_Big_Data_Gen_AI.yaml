    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building big data infrastructure
      (Spark, Lakehouse architectures, data pipelines) and
      distributed systems to support ML initiatives, not directly
      building or deploying AI models. The primary
      responsibilities involve designing data platform
      architectures, optimizing big data workflows, and
      engineering scalable systems - all enabling work for AI/ML
      rather than hands-on model development.
  responsibilities:
  - Drive innovative vision for products and platforms, design and launch strategic
    ML solutions
  - Lead end-to-end software development lifecycle including design, testing, deployment,
    and operations
  - Craft high-performance Big Data Lakehouse architectures such as Hudi, Delta, or
    Iceberg
  - Develop Big Data Platform to solve big data pipeline and processing challenges
  - Mentor and develop other engineers, establish technical direction and foster team
    culture
  - Build highly resilient and scalable systems and champion operational and process
    improvements
  use_cases:
  - Cloud-driven networking solutions for digital transformation
  - Big data processing and analytics pipelines
  - Machine learning platform infrastructure for networking applications
  - Distributed systems for data lakehouse architectures
  - Automation and analytics using AI/ML capabilities
