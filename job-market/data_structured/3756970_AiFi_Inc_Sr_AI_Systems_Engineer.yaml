    reasoning: |-
      This is an AI-first role focused on computer vision research
      and development. The engineer will directly implement state-
      of-the-art 3D reconstruction, semantic segmentation, multi-
      view stereo, and SLAM systems - core computer vision AI
      technologies.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead development of scene understanding systems for calibrating hundreds of cameras
    in retail spaces
  - Translate state-of-the-art computer vision research into scalable, maintainable
    engineering systems
  - Manage scene calibration technologies and collaborate with product managers on
    roadmaps
  - Deploy, monitor, and support Scene Understanding Services across hundreds of stores
  - Enforce best practices in software development and project management
  - Mentor engineers and build collaborative remote team environment
  - Evaluate emerging AI trends and technologies for potential applications in current
    and future projects
  use_cases:
  - Camera calibration for retail spaces with hundreds of cameras
  - 3D reconstruction from multi-view camera images
  - Semantic segmentation for scene understanding in autonomous retail
  - Structure from Motion and SLAM for spatial mapping
  - Scene understanding services deployed across hundreds of retail stores
