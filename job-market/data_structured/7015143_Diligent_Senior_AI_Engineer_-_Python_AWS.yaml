      The role involves building, deploying, and scaling ML and
      LLM-based systems, including RAG pipelines, prompt
      engineering, embeddings, and LLM integration. This is hands-
      on work with models (building, deploying, fine-tuning,
      optimizing) rather than just supporting infrastructure for
      others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, deploy, monitor, scale, and troubleshoot AI, ML, and LLM-based
    systems that power services across the platform
  - Build and maintain Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, including document
    ingestion, embeddings, vector search, and response orchestration
  - Develop AI solutions using AWS Bedrock and related AWS services for secure and
    scalable model inference
  - Build automated AI testing and evaluation frameworks to measure quality, performance,
    and reliability of LLM outputs
  - Collaborate with Applied Scientists and Software Engineers to implement and productize
    AI-based capabilities
  - Shape and evolve the team's AI platform infrastructure, leveraging established
    architectural patterns and infrastructure-as-code practices
  - Design and develop AI libraries and frameworks to accelerate value delivery across
    AI platform services
  - Work on projects involving sensitive customer content used for board communications,
    requiring strong privacy and security controls
  use_cases:
  - Board communications and governance workflows
  - Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) solutions
  - Enterprise search and document retrieval
  - Automated insights generation for decision making
  - Secure AI processing of sensitive customer content
