      This is a Computer Vision Research Engineer role focused on
      building traditional CV models for object recognition,
      tracking, and video understanding. The role involves
      developing, extending, and evaluating state-of-the-art deep
      learning-based CV architectures, but does not mention
      working with LLMs, generative AI, or agent-based systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop computer vision models and pipelines using state-of-the-art methods and
    architectures
  - Design experiments and conduct benchmarks to evaluate performance in real-world
    scenarios
  - Apply and develop techniques to adapt models to target hardware and compute constraints
  - Contribute to impactful projects and collaborate across teams and backgrounds
  use_cases:
  - Object recognition and tracking for defence applications
  - Video understanding and scene matching
  - AI-powered perception systems to assist human decision-making
  - Robust computer vision with hardware constraints and adversarial resistance
