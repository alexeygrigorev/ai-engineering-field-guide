  - Implement and deploy Machine Learning solutions to solve complex problems and
    deliver real business value
  - Collaborate with data product managers, software engineers and SMEs to identify
    AI/ML opportunities for improving process efficiency
  - Develop production-grade ML models to enhance customer experience, content recommendation,
    content generation, and predictive analysis
  - Monitor and improve model performance via data enhancement, feature engineering,
    experimentation and online/offline evaluation
  - Stay up to date with the latest in machine learning and artificial intelligence
    and influence AI/ML for the Life science industry
  use_cases:
  - Content recommendation and generation for life sciences validation
  - Predictive analysis for manufacturing excellence and compliance
  - Computer vision for image processing in validation workflows
  - NLP applications for process efficiency improvement
  - Causal AI for understanding relationships in validation data
  - Digital transformation and workflow optimization across product lifecycle
