  focus: LLM training through human feedback for code generation
position:
  title: AI Software Engineer (C#)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves providing human feedback for RLHF
      training of LLMs through code evaluation, ranking, and
      refactoring. The engineer works WITH AI systems but does not
      build, deploy, or fine-tune models - they generate training
      data and feedback signals that enable others to improve the
      models.
  responsibilities:
  - Compare and rank multiple code snippets to provide detailed explanations of which
    approach is best and why
  - Repair and refactor AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and style
  - Inject feedback including ratings, edits, and test results into the RLHF pipeline
    to maintain smooth operation
  - Generate reward signals through reinforcement learning that help models learn
    to propose and improve code
  - Provide clear written justifications for code critiques and improvement suggestions
  - Maintain code quality by identifying logic errors, performance traps, and security
    issues in generated code
  use_cases:
  - Training large language models to write production-grade code across multiple
    programming languages
  - Improving code generation quality through human feedback and reinforcement learning
  - Teaching models to propose, critique, and improve code similar to expert engineers
  - Generating reward signals from expert code reviews to fine-tune model behavior
  - Building code evaluation capabilities that help models identify and fix errors
