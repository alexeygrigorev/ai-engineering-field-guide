    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves building AI-driven process automation
      tools and internal applications, but the focus is on
      implementing AI for workflow optimization rather than
      building, training, or fine-tuning models. The position
      emphasizes scripting, CI/CD, automation frameworks (GitHub
      Actions, Power Automate), and software engineering to reduce
      manual toil - this is working NEAR AI to enable automation
      rather than directly ON AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and maintain AI-driven process automation tools and internal
    applications
  - Build, test, and deploy custom integrations and workflows using scripting and
    automation frameworks like GitHub Actions and Power Automate
  - Collaborate with program managers and cross-functional stakeholders to identify
    automation opportunities that reduce manual toil
  - Write clean, efficient, and scalable code in TypeScript, Python, Go, or Bash for
    automation solutions
  - Gather and analyze system requirements, document specifications, and create proof-of-concept
    solutions
  - Conduct unit and integration testing, troubleshoot production issues, and ensure
    high-quality deliverables
  - Contribute to experimental AI projects aimed at enhancing productivity and collaboration
    in hybrid work environments
  use_cases:
  - Intelligent process automation tools to reduce operational friction across cross-functional
    teams
  - AI-driven process optimization to identify and eliminate manual toil
  - Custom integrations and workflows using automation frameworks to streamline operations
  - Internal tooling that enhances team productivity in hybrid work environments
  - AI-assisted automation workflows for enterprise collaboration ecosystems
