      This role involves hands-on work with AI systems including
      building RAG pipelines, implementing agentic workflows, and
      selectively fine-tuning language models for specific legal
      tasks. The engineer owns the entire lifecycle of AI features
      from building underlying systems to customizing models,
      which directly aligns with working ON AI rather than just

    Generation (RAG) pipelines and agentic workflows
  - Selectively fine-tune and adapt language models to improve performance on highly
    specific legal tasks where off-the-shelf solutions fall short
  - Develop practical evaluation methods and monitoring systems to ensure the reliability,
    accuracy, and efficiency of AI features in production
  - Identify and apply the most effective AI techniques and tools from the research
    frontier to solve immediate product challenges
  - Collaborate with product, backend, and in-house legal experts to deliver end-to-end
    solutions that enhance user effectiveness
  - Take full ownership of AI features from initial concept through deployment and
    iteration
