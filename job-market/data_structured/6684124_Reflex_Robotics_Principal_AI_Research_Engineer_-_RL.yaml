  title: Principal AI Research Engineer - RL
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is hands-on building and deploying reinforcement
      learning algorithms for robotics, requiring re-
      implementation of RL algorithms (SAC, DDPG) from scratch and
      shipping on-policy RL on real hardware. The engineer will be
      directly developing robot policies and working with their
      proprietary robotics data to train AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Create robust robot policies using on-policy reinforcement learning algorithms
  - Re-implement and optimize core RL algorithms (SAC, DDPG) from scratch for robotics
    applications
  - Debug unstable gradients and tune hyperparameters for RL systems
  - Deploy on-policy RL on real-world hardware for learning in production environments
  - Develop sample-efficient RL algorithms to improve robot performance
  - Work with proprietary robotics datasets to train increasingly capable AI systems
  use_cases:
  - Automating dangerous and repetitive tasks in manufacturing and logistics
  - Loading products into containers in e-commerce warehouses
  - Lifting and moving heavy packages in retail environments
  - Cleaning and maintenance tasks in various settings
  - Real-time teleoperation with human-in-the-loop feedback for policy improvement
  - Achieving 99.99% success rates in robotic manipulation tasks
