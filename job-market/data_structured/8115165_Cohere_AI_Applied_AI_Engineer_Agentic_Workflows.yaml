  title: Applied AI Engineer – Agentic Workflows
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is an Applied AI Engineer role building, deploying, and
      optimizing agentic workflows powered by LLMs. The role
      requires hands-on experience with agent orchestration
      frameworks, RAG implementation, prompt engineering, and tool
      integration - all core AI/ML system development work.
  responsibilities:
  - Work with enterprise customers and internal teams to turn business workflows into
    scalable, production-ready agentic AI systems
  - Design and build LLM-powered agents that reason, plan, and act across tools and
    data sources with enterprise-grade reliability
  - Balance rapid iteration with enterprise requirements, evolving prototypes into
    stable, reusable solutions
  - Define and apply evaluation and quality standards to measure success, failures,
    and regressions
  - Debug real-world agent behavior and systematically improve prompts, workflows,
    tools, and guardrails
  - Contribute to shared frameworks and patterns that enable consistent delivery across
    customers
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise workflow automation through agentic AI systems
  - Content generation and semantic search powered by LLMs
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for enterprise knowledge access
  - Multi-step agent workflows that reason, plan, and act across tools and data sources
  - Tool and API integration for autonomous task execution
  - Human-in-the-loop workflows with enterprise-grade reliability and observability
