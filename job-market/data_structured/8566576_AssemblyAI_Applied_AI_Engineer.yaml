      This is a customer-facing technical role that supports
      customers in implementing AssemblyAI's Speech AI models, but
      does not involve building, training, or fine-tuning the
      models themselves. The engineer focuses on integration,
      troubleshooting, demos, and providing technical guidance on
      using pre-built APIs rather than working on the AI models
      directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Guide customers through their entire product journey from implementation to production
    deployment and ongoing support
  - Build custom demos and prototypes showcasing AssemblyAI's Speech AI models for
    specific customer use cases
  - Lead technical discovery sessions and provide architecture guidance for integrating
    APIs
  - Troubleshoot production issues for customers using streaming and async APIs across
    multiple programming languages
  - Serve as the voice of the customer to Product and Research teams, testing new
    features and providing feedback
  - Contribute to documentation, guides, and example code to help developers integrate
    APIs effectively
  - Experiment with new use cases and build open-source demos and reference implementations
  - Represent AssemblyAI at conferences and industry events, delivering talks or running
    workshops
  use_cases:
  - Voice agents and meeting assistants
  - Contact center solutions and analytics
  - Medical scribes and healthcare documentation
