    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role requires hands-on work building and deploying LLM-
      based applications using RAG, prompt engineering, vector
      databases, and fine-tuning models. The engineer directly
      constructs production AI systems including generative AI
      systems, agent-based architectures, and model serving
      infrastructure, not just supporting infrastructure for
      others.
  responsibilities:
  - Establish and enforce architecture standards for production AI systems, including
    data pipelines, model serving infrastructure, and real-time inference services
  - Implement AIOps/MLOps pipelines for CI/CD of ML models, model governance, monitoring,
    and lifecycle management
  - Build and deploy LLM-based applications using RAG, prompt engineering, vector
    databases, and agent-based architectures
  - Design and maintain scalable software applications with integrated AI/ML capabilities
    using Snowflake as the primary ML platform
  - Partner with cross-functional teams to operationalize AI algorithms and coordinate
    between research and engineering teams
  - Optimize model serving for performance and scale using techniques like model compression,
    caching, and hardware acceleration
  - Build end-to-end AI solutions from front-end (React) to back-end APIs (Flask,
    FastAPI, Node.js)
  - Implement monitoring, alerting, and SRE principles to ensure AI system reliability
    and detect model degradation
  use_cases:
  - Generative AI systems for banking operations and customer services
  - Personalization engines for tailored banking experiences and recommendations
  - Automation tools for streamlining banking processes and workflows
  - Fraud detection and risk assessment using AI/ML models
  - AML (Anti-Money Laundering) compliance and monitoring systems
  - Commercial/treasury analytics for business banking decisions
