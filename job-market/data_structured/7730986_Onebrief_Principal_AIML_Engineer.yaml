      The role involves hands-on work building AI systems
      including multi-agent orchestration, RAG implementation,
      knowledge graph integration, and deploying LLMs in
      production. The Principal AI/ML Engineer will architect and
      implement these AI solutions directly, not just support
      infrastructure for them.
  responsibilities:
  - Partner with product and domain experts to translate operational needs into technical
    roadmaps
  - Define system-level standards for model development, evaluation, and deployment
    while mentoring engineers
  - Drive long-term AI/ML architecture including agent orchestration systems coordinating
    multiple AI agents, tools, and workflows
  - Design and implement enterprise-scale AI infrastructure supporting retrieval,
    generation, and multi-modal reasoning
  - Build and scale graph-based systems for structured representation and reasoning
    integrated with generative models
  - Apply LLM practices like RAG and prompt engineering to deliver grounded outputs
    for mission planning
  - Establish evaluation frameworks and SLOs for RAG quality, agent reliability, and
    system performance in production
  - Collaborate with infrastructure teams to ensure high-quality data pipelines powering
    AI applications
  use_cases:
  - Transform complex military requirements for planning critical operations into
    robust production-ready systems
  - Enable distributed human-AI collaboration at scale using multi-modal foundation
    models
  - Coordinate AI agents to accomplish complex operational tasks in mission-critical
    environments
  - Support thousands of users in regulated, offline-capable environments for military
    operations
  - Combine text, structured data, and domain-specific signals for orchestrated AI
    systems
  - Deliver grounded and reliable AI outputs for military mission planning workflows
