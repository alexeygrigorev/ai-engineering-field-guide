  name: extend (extend.app)
  stage: Series A
  focus: Modern document processing platform using LLMs
position:
  title: Applied AI/ML Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is an AI-first role focused on building LLM-based
      document processing systems. The engineer will directly
      deploy QA agents, optimizer agents, multimodal models, and
      implement novel LLM techniques, not just supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design novel LLM techniques for increasing the complexity of use cases and data
    streams that Extend can be applied to
  - Monitor existing models in production, understand what's working well (and what
    isn't), and run experiments to solve those issues
  - Build QA agents to flag low confidence results and optimizer agents that improve
    document performance in the background
  - Create multimodal models for document layout awareness and novel chunking strategies
    for handling long documents
  - Build data pipelines and evaluate model performance while developing self-correcting
    systems
  - Take complete ownership over large areas of product and engineering with direct
    relationship with customers
  use_cases:
  - Document processing and extraction for enterprise workflows at scale
  - Automated QA and confidence scoring for document analysis results
  - Self-optimizing document processing systems that improve performance over time
  - Multimodal document understanding combining text and layout information
  - Mission-critical data processing for payments, real estate, and financial services
