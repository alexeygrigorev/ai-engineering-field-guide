      This role requires building, deploying, and operationalizing
      generative AI systems, LLM agents, and ML models. The
      engineer works directly on implementing RAG, agent
      frameworks (LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI), and turning AI
      prototypes into production systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and maintain end-to-end ML and AI pipelines, including training, testing,
    deployment, and monitoring
  - Partner with AI Scientists to translate prototypes and research models into scalable,
    production-ready systems
  - Develop APIs and microservices to integrate AI capabilities directly into business
    applications and workflows
  - Implement automation, testing, and monitoring for reliability, performance, and
    reproducibility
  - Experiment with and operationalize agentic frameworks to orchestrate intelligent,
    tool-using systems
  - Apply AI-augmented development tools to accelerate engineering velocity
  use_cases:
  - AI-driven search and merchandising optimization for B2B distribution
  - Dynamic pricing and demand forecasting systems
  - Automated customer support workflows using generative AI
  - Agentic architectures for autonomous and semi-autonomous business operations
  - RAG-based knowledge retrieval for distributor operations
