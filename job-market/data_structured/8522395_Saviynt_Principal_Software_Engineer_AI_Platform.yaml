      This is a Principal Software Engineer role for an AI
      Platform focused on building Java-based backend services,
      distributed systems, and platform infrastructure. The role
      involves creating the foundational platform and APIs that
      support AI workloads, but does not involve hands-on model
      development, training, fine-tuning, or deploying AI/ML
      models directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the design, development, and scalability of core Java-based backend services
    that power the multi-tenant platform
  - Architect and optimize platform components to support high-throughput, low-latency,
    and mission-critical workflows
  - Integrate and manage core data systems including relational databases, Redis,
    Elasticsearch, and LDAP
  - Drive the modernization of backend services, refactoring legacy Java components
    and adopting modern patterns like reactive programming and event-driven architectures
  - Build and maintain platform APIs, service orchestration logic, and critical workflows
    that support core business operations
  - Evaluate and implement scalable solutions for authentication, authorization, tenant
    isolation, and configuration management
  - Identify and remediate bottlenecks in Java services including JVM performance,
    GC tuning, thread management, and memory footprint
  - Mentor engineers across teams in deep Java design principles, debugging complex
    issues, and engineering for reliability
  use_cases:
  - Multi-tenant platform infrastructure supporting high-concurrency enterprise workloads
  - Identity and access management with authentication, authorization, and SSO integration
  - High-throughput data processing and management across distributed systems
  - Service orchestration and workflow automation for core business operations
  - Observability and monitoring platform for distributed microservices environment
