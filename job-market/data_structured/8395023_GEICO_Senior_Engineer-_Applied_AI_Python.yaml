      This is a hands-on engineering role directly building
      Generative AI systems using LangChain, LangGraph, and
      agentic workflows. The role involves implementing RAG
      patterns, building AI agents, and deploying production AI
      applications - clearly working ON AI systems rather than
      supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and maintain scalable microservices using Python, FastAPI, and
    LangChain/LangGraph to power AI-enabled applications
  - Build and integrate AI agents and agentic workflows that orchestrate tools, APIs,
    reasoning steps, and business logic
  - Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) patterns, Model Context Protocol
    (MCP) integrations, and agent skills
  - Leverage knowledge graphs and vector databases to enhance reasoning, entity relationships,
    and context retrieval
  - Contribute to architecture and implementation of applied AI solutions including
    automation, document intelligence, and intelligent assistants
  - Ensure production systems meet high standards for scalability, resilience, performance,
    and availability
  - Collaborate with cross-functional partners to translate business needs into technical
    AI solutions
  - Drive continuous improvement by exploring new models, frameworks, and reasoning
    techniques
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise workflow automation using AI-powered intelligent assistants
  - Document intelligence systems for processing and extracting insights from documents
  - Decision support systems that improve business decision-making across the enterprise
  - Customer experience enhancement through generative AI applications
  - Knowledge graph and vector search integration for enhanced context retrieval and
    reasoning
  - Agentic workflows that orchestrate business logic with AI capabilities
