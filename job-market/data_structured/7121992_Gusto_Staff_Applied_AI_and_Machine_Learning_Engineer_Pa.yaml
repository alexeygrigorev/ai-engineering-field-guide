    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves building and deploying machine learning
      models from scratch, including LLM integration for enhancing
      traditional risk models. The engineer directly develops
      predictive models for fraud/credit risk and deploys them
      into production, making it hands-on AI work rather than just
      support infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and deploy machine learning models to identify, assess and mitigate payment
    and fraud risks
  - Drive end-to-end model development from research through deployment and ongoing
    performance monitoring
  - Partner cross-functionally with Engineering, Design, and Product teams to solve
    complex problems in Payments and Risk domains
  - Develop scalable frameworks and libraries that enhance team's analysis and modeling
    capabilities
  - Integrate Large Language Models to improve data processing, analysis and insights
  - Identify new opportunities to leverage data to improve Gusto's products and present
    results to stakeholders
  use_cases:
  - Credit risk modeling to assess payment and lending risks
  - Fraud detection and prevention using traditional ML models and AI-enhanced approaches
  - Anomaly detection for suspicious payment patterns and user activities
  - Risk assessment platform for safeguarding users' financial transactions
  - NLP-based data processing and insights generation using LLMs
