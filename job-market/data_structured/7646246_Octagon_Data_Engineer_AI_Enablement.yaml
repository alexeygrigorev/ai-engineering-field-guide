    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a data engineering role focused on building
      infrastructure and pipelines to support AI/LLM solutions
      rather than building models directly. The work involves
      vector databases, embeddings pipelines, retrieval APIs, and
      data foundations that enable AI systems to function, but
      does not include model training, fine-tuning, or deployment
      of ML models.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and operate vector database search layers and document-chunking/embedding
    pipelines for discoverability
  - Implement and maintain ELT/ETL pipelines to support data labeling, classification,
    and document parsing workflows
  - Expose governed retrieval endpoints with permission controls, metadata filters,
    and source attribution for grounding
  - Normalize, transform, and move JSON and structured payloads through workflows
    ensuring reliable automation outputs
  - Collaborate with product, design, data science, and commercial teams to align
    on unified roadmaps and data contracts
  - Productionize prototypes from Solutions Engineers with CI/CD, telemetry, and cost
    guardrails
  - Build monitoring for freshness and retrieval quality, secrets management, and
    audit logging aligned with enterprise governance
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise search across organizational content using vector similarity search
  - RAG-style retrieval systems that provide accurate, grounded responses with source
    citations
  - Document processing and parsing workflows that structure unstructured content
    for AI consumption
  - AI-powered knowledge discovery that respects access control permissions and security
