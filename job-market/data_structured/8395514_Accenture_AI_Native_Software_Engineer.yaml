position:
  title: AI Native Software Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on design and deployment of agentic
      systems including retrieval, orchestration, RAG workflows,
      and tool invocation. The engineer builds and runs AI agents
      directly, not just supporting infrastructure for others who
      work on AI.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build enterprise-ready AI agents with retrieval, orchestration, policy-based
    routing, tool invocation, evaluation harnesses, and lifecycle observability
  - Develop abstraction layers across AI providers (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI) to
    enable seamless integration and multi-provider enablement
  - Leverage containerization (Kubernetes, Docker), microservices, serverless, event-driven
    architectures, CI/CD, and observability stacks to deliver scalable AI-native systems
  - Tailor and deploy agentic applications across verticals (finance, healthcare,
    retail) by adapting to domain-specific processes and constraints
  - Participate in and lead design workshops, POCs, and code-with sessions to shape
    data-driven agent workflows with stakeholders
  - Define and use key metrics, test harnesses, and evaluation plans to measure agent
    accuracy, latency, safety, and cost effectiveness
  use_cases:
  - Agent-powered enterprise workflows that augment business processes
  - Domain-specific agentic applications across finance, healthcare, and retail verticals
  - Multi-provider AI platform integration enabling seamless switching between Anthropic,
    Google, OpenAI, and open-source models
  - Policy-based routing and orchestration of AI agents for complex enterprise decision-making
  - Evaluation and observability systems to monitor agent performance, accuracy, and
    safety in production
