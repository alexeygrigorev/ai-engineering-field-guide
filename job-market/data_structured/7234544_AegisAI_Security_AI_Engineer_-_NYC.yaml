      The role involves building AI Agents for threat detection,
      directly working with models that need daily adaptation.
      This is hands-on development of AI systems (agents,
      orchestration layer) not just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect a constellation of AI agents for detecting and stopping emerging threats
  - Design and implement orchestration layer for rapid iteration and adaptive learning
  - Live in live threat data to evolve agents at the speed of the battlefield
  - Build fast, cheap, and high-precision detection systems
  - Develop new detection paradigms as threats evolve in real-time
  - Iterate quickly on AI systems to stay ahead of adversarial AI attacks
  use_cases:
  - Detecting and stopping adversarial AI attacks in real-time
  - Identifying customized, high-evasion attacks crafted by AI-enabled adversaries
  - Providing rapid threat detection that outpaces traditional rules-based systems
  - Orchestrating multiple AI agents to collaboratively identify emerging threats
  - Defending organizations against AI-powered security threats and customized evasive
    payloads
