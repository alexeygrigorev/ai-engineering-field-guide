      The role involves hands-on work with LLMs including
      developing prompts, building LLM-based applications and
      frameworks, working with embeddings and RAG pipelines. The
      role requires directly building and deploying AI-driven
      tools, not just supporting infrastructure for other AI
      engineers.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build AI-powered applications to analyze, summarize, and generate insights
    from survey data
  - Develop and optimize prompts and chains for LLM-based applications
  - Build applications to simplify analytics and improve the efficiency of data processing
  - Work with structured and unstructured data sources including surveys and behavioral
    tracking
  - Contribute to model evaluation and performance tracking using both qualitative
    and quantitative metrics
  - Stay up to date with recent developments in AI and machine learning, including
    LLMs, embeddings, and RAG pipelines
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered survey data analysis and insight generation
  - Text summarization and topic modeling for market research
  - RAG pipelines for extracting insights from unstructured survey responses
  - Natural language processing for text classification and opinion analysis
  - Fraud detection and data quality improvement in survey responses
