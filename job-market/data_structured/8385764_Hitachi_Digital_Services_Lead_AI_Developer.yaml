      This is a hands-on AI development role focused on building,
      deploying, and implementing production-grade AI models,
      agents, and algorithms using Agentic AI frameworks and LLM
      technologies. The role involves direct work with Gemini
      Enterprise, multi-agent orchestration, RAG pipelines, and
      LLMOps practices, which are core ai-first responsibilities
      rather than supporting or enabling work.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and implement production-grade AI models, agents, and algorithms
    using Agentic AI frameworks including multi-agent orchestration, tool-use, memory,
    and judge/ranker patterns
  - Lead delivery of Gemini Enterprise solutions including Agent Workspace/Agent Builder,
    defining agent roles, toolchains, and safety guardrails for enterprise workflows
  - Drive new AI initiatives across operating companies and corporate functions, ensuring
    secure integration with existing systems, data sources, and processes
  - Implement RAG pipelines including document ingestion, embeddings, vector search,
    grounding, and citations
  - Establish LLMOps/MLOps practices including CI/CD, versioning, evaluation harnesses,
    rollback, and prompt/test suites with AI Ops observability
  - Enhance and scale current Agentic AI capabilities for improved performance, latency,
    reliability, and cost efficiency
  - Collaborate with product, engineering, data, and business teams to translate requirements
    into high-impact AI features and APIs
  - Troubleshoot complex production issues across models, agents, tooling, and integrations;
    drive root-cause analysis and corrective actions
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise workflow automation using Agentic AI with safety guardrails and secure
    system integration
  - Knowledge management and information retrieval using RAG pipelines with document
    ingestion, embeddings, and vector search
  - Enterprise system integration connecting agents with ERP, CRM, ITSM, Finance,
    and Procurement systems via APIs and eventing
  - Intelligent document processing with grounding, citations, and context-aware responses
  - Enterprise AI governance with compliance standards, audit logs, model cards, and
    policy checks
  - Operational efficiency improvements through AI-powered automation of cross-functional
    business processes
