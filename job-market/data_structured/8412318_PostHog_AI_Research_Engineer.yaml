    Product analytics and business operating system platform
    with AI-powered analyst
position:
  title: AI Research Engineer

    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role explicitly involves training, fine-tuning, and
      running models to achieve product autonomy - building AI
      systems that can autonomously fix bugs and ship features
      based on customer data. This is hands-on work directly ON
      AI/ML models and systems, not just supporting AI
      infrastructure or platforms.
  responsibilities:
  - Train, fine-tune, and run models to achieve product autonomy
  - Use PostHog's vast data (trillion+ data points) to build systems that fix bugs,
    address issues, and ship features automatically
  - Work on product autonomy that anticipates what users want to build before they
    explicitly ask for it
  - Prioritize and identify high-impact areas for AI-driven product autonomy features
  - Work on a new team focused on product autonomy, collaborating closely with one
    of the founders
  - Iterate quickly in a rapidly changing, uncertain environment where technologies
    and approaches evolve fast
  use_cases:
  - Product autonomy - automatically building or suggesting features based on user
    intent and patterns
  - Automated bug detection and fixing using product telemetry data
  - AI-powered analyst that answers product questions and writes custom SQL queries
  - Session replay analysis to surface useful recordings to users
  - Customer request prioritization by analyzing internal conversations and feedback
  - Code generation and autonomous engineering assistance to reduce manual coding
