  - Design and implement modern, scalable front-end systems in React, TypeScript,
    and GraphQL
  - Build SDKs and reusable component libraries that bridge AI systems and product
    surfaces
  - Prototype intelligent, data-rich workflows that blend human interaction with AI
    assistance
  - Work across the stack to connect frontend features to Python/FastAPI backends
    and APIs
  - Collaborate with AI and backend teams to design clean interfaces between systems
  - Create UI patterns that visualize AI reasoning, feedback, and real-time collaboration
  - Shape engineering best practices for modularity, observability, and performance
  - Mentor other engineers and influence technical direction across Sirona's product
    stack
