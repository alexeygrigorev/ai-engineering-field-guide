position:
  title: Senior Knowledge Graph Engineer / AI Architect
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is an ai-first role because it directly involves
      building LLM + graph systems, prototyping real-time
      applications with LLMs, and developing autonomous agents.
      The role requires hands-on experience with LLM tools like
      LangChain and CrewAI, integrating AI models for reasoning
      and implementing advanced inference systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and scale Knowledge Graphs using RDF, OWL, SPARQL, and Neo4j
  - Integrate AI models for reasoning, enrichment, and search capabilities
  - Develop semantic pipelines including NLP, entity linking, and ontology alignment
  - Lead technical strategy and mentor engineering teams
  - Prototype LLM + graph systems for real-time applications
  - Architect scalable solutions combining semantic technologies with AI models for
    advanced inference
  use_cases:
  - Advanced inference and decision support systems
  - Autonomous agents powered by knowledge graphs and AI reasoning
  - Real-time applications combining LLMs with graph databases
  - Semantic search and enrichment using knowledge graphs
  - Knowledge-driven AI systems for intelligent decision-making
