      applications but does not work hands-on with model
      development, inference, or LLM fine-tuning.

  - Automate manual tasks through AI to achieve efficiency gains across the marketing
    organization
  - Manage critical, high-volume data pipelines with SLAs for growth initiatives and
    advanced analytics while improving efficiency and data quality
  - Facilitate sophisticated data integration and transformation requirements between
    applications, data marts, AI models, and CDP environments
  - Partner directly with non-technical stakeholders to translate business questions
    into technical requirements and scalable data solutions
  - Write optimized data transformations in Python/SQL to generate data products for
    customer systems and operations teams
  - Mentor junior engineers, conduct code reviews, and define best practices for the
