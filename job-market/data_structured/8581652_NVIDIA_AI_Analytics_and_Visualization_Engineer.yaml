      This role is directly building AI agent workflows and
      orchestration services that use LLMs to automate multi-step
      processes. The engineer is hands-on implementing agents,
      coordinating model calls, and creating AI-powered tools,
      which aligns with building and deploying AI/ML systems
      rather than just supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and run AI agent workflows involving LLMs and tools to automate multi-step
    processes
  - Build orchestration services that coordinate model calls, tools, and human review
  - Develop APIs that expose AI agents to internal apps and UIs
  - Connect existing ETL and data pipelines as tools and context for agents
  - Construct simple web or chat interfaces for workflows powered by artificial intelligence
  - Ensure scalability, performance, and security of AI services and data flows
  use_cases:
  - Automate complex engineering and business processes using AI agents
  - Streamline workflows across systems using LLM-powered orchestration
  - Enable data-driven decision-making through AI-powered tools
  - Integrate and coordinate multi-step processes with human review
