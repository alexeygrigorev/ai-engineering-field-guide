      The role involves directly architecting and building GenAI
      systems including LLMs, RAG architectures, vector search,
      and embeddings for conversational data exploration. The
      candidate is required to deploy AI/ML/GenAI products in
      production and implement AI-first architectures, not just
      support infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and scale GenAI systems for conversational data exploration, addressing
    real-world biomarker data challenges through production-ready features
  - Design and implement AI-first architectures, including GenAI pipelines, embeddings,
    vector search, and semantic search technologies
  - Make strategic architectural decisions that balance performance, cost, scalability,
    and maintainability across AI systems
  - Continuously improve AI-powered features, optimizing for accuracy, latency, and
    user experience
  - Shape the roadmap for AI experiences, aligning technical innovation with product
    goals and user needs
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams including Product, Design, and Engineering
    teams to design, develop, test, and maintain software applications
  use_cases:
  - Conversational data exploration for biomarker data
  - Semantic search and insight generation across clinical and biospecimen data
  - Enterprise-level sample and biomarker data management for biotech/pharma
  - Automated data management workflows for life sciences R&D teams
  - Connecting biospecimen, assay, and clinical data sources in a secure cloud infrastructure
