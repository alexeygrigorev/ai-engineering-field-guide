      The role is hands-on building AI-enabled solutions including
      agentic workflows, RAG implementations, AI agents with tool
      integration, and MCP servers. The engineer directly designs,
      develops, and deploys these AI capabilities using frameworks
      like LangChain and APIs from OpenAI/Anthropic, rather than
      just supporting AI work done by others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and develop AI-enabled microservices, APIs, applications, and internal
    tools
  - Build agentic workflows using frameworks like LangChain with tool integration,
    memory, and guardrails
  - Implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows to enhance context and
    reliability
  - Integrate AI capabilities into low-code automation platforms like Power Automate,
    n8n, and Workato
  - Develop Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for secure AI-to-system connectivity
  - Lead AI-based document parsing and intelligent data extraction initiatives
  - Establish AI observability practices including monitoring model behavior and detecting
    anomalies
  - Mentor technical and non-technical staff on responsible AI adoption and best practices
  use_cases:
  - Intelligent automation and workflow optimization
  - Enterprise document parsing and data extraction
  - Agentic AI workflows for business process automation
  - AI-enabled microservices and API integrations
  - Low-code/no-code platform enhancement with AI capabilities
