      This role focuses on providing human feedback for RLHF
      (ranking code, writing critiques, refactoring) rather than
      building, training, or deploying AI models. The engineer
      enables the model to improve through annotation and code
      review tasks, which is supporting work for AI development.
  responsibilities:
  - Compare and rank multiple code snippets with detailed explanations of quality
  - Repair and refactor AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and style
  - Inject feedback including ratings, edits, and test results into the RLHF pipeline
  - Provide detailed code reviews identifying logic errors, performance issues, and
    security problems
  - Maintain smooth operation of the RLHF feedback loop through consistent quality
    annotations
  use_cases:
  - Training large language models to write production-grade code in multiple programming
    languages
  - Improving AI code generation through reinforcement learning with human feedback
  - Converting expert code review feedback into reward signals for model fine-tuning
  - Developing models that can critique and improve their own code outputs
