      The role involves hands-on implementation, deployment, and
      maintenance of ML models including forecasting, regression,
      classification, and ensemble methods. Additionally, the role
      requires working with modern AI approaches including LLMs,
      embeddings, and vector databases, indicating direct work on
      AI systems rather than just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and maintain full-stack applications that deliver predictive insights
    through scalable, user-facing interfaces
  - Develop and maintain automated data pipelines for ingesting, processing, and transforming
    large-scale structured and unstructured data
  - Implement, deploy, and maintain machine learning models including forecasting,
    regression, classification, and ensemble methods
  - Build and maintain backend services, APIs, and integrations that support analytics
    and modeling workflows
  - Work with modern AI approaches, including large language models, to support automation
    and data-driven workflows
  - Optimize system performance, reliability, and scalability across data pipelines
    and ML services
  - Support experimentation, testing, and validation of models and analytical outputs
  - Contribute to best practices for code quality, monitoring, and operational stability
    of production ML systems
  use_cases:
  - Media intelligence and analytics for predicting advertising ROI and revenue growth
  - Predictive forecasting and forward-looking analysis to see weeks or months into
    the future
  - Multi-source data integration and real-time processing for media acquisition decisions
  - Causal modeling and statistical analysis to understand media spend impact on business
    outcomes
  - Automated workflows and data-driven decision support for media investment optimization
