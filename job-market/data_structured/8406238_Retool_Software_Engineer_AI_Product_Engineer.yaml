      This role is hands-on working directly with LLMs and AI
      systems - building RAG implementations, few-shot prompting,
      agentic architectures, and generative UIs that create apps
      from natural language. The engineer is developing,
      evaluating, and optimizing AI features, not just supporting
      infrastructure for other AI practitioners.
  responsibilities:
  - Build generative UIs that enable users to create real applications from natural
    language descriptions
  - Improve performance, observability, and safety of internal model architecture
  - Extend AI evaluation systems to support smarter ranking, feedback loops, and product
    metrics
  - Develop patterns for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), few-shot prompting,
    and agentic architecture
  - Contribute to building internal tools that accelerate iteration on AI features
    and workflows
  use_cases:
  - Natural language to app generation
  - Intelligent internal tools development
  - Developer productivity automation
  - AI-powered software building
  - Enterprise operational tools
