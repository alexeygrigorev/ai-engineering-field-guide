  - Contribute features, patterns, and abstractions to the Mosaic product toolkit
    based on customer engagement learnings
  - Work backwards from customer vision to surface specific AI applications with clear
    business value
  - Ship AI solutions quickly while balancing speed and quality in complex production
    environments
  use_cases:
  - Deploying agentic workflows for critical industries including healthcare, manufacturing,
    and energy
  - Building multi-step AI agents with tool use capabilities for enterprise automation
  - Implementing RAG pipelines for knowledge retrieval and document analysis
  - Creating human-in-the-loop AI systems that integrate with existing business operations
  - Developing AI solutions that drive measurable business value for industry-leading
