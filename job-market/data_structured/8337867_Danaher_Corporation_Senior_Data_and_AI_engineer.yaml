  - Partner with Data Science teams to support model training, feature engineering,
    and deployment processes
  - Collaborate with data scientists, project managers, and software engineering teams
    to understand data needs and translate business requirements into technical solutions
  - Develop and manage data architecture, data lakes, and data warehouses supporting
    Service AI use cases
  - Optimize data storage, compute, and retrieval strategies for structured and unstructured
    data
  - Support MLOps workflows by enabling model deployment, monitoring, and versioning
    pipelines
