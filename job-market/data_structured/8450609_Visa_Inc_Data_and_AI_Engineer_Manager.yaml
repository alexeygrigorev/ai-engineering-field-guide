      This is a Data Engineering Manager role that focuses on
      building data infrastructure and platforms to enable AI/ML
      workloads. The role involves creating feature stores, model
      serving infrastructure, and data pipelines for GenAI
      applications, but does not include building, training, fine-
      tuning, or deploying models directly. The position enables
      AI work through data engineering and MLOps practices rather
      than hands-on AI model development.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build enterprise-scale data platforms using modern big data technologies
    and cloud-native services
  - Architect robust, scalable data pipelines that process petabytes of data for batch,
    streaming, and real-time analytics
  - Build data infrastructure that supports AI/ML workloads including feature stores,
    training pipelines, and model serving infrastructure
  - Implement streaming data pipelines using Kafka and Spark Streaming for real-time
    analytics and decision-making
  - Manage and optimize cloud infrastructure on AWS/Azure including S3, EMR, EC2,
    Lambda, Glue, Redshift, and SageMaker
  - Design and implement data pipelines for GenAI applications including embeddings
    generation, vector storage, and retrieval systems
  - Mentor junior data engineers and drive technical decisions on architecture, tooling,
    and engineering practices
  - Partner with product managers, data scientists, and business stakeholders to translate
    requirements into technical solutions
  use_cases:
  - Global payments processing infrastructure for Visa's 200+ countries and territories
  - Enterprise-scale data analytics and insights for global clients and financial
    institutions
  - Real-time fraud detection and decision-making using streaming data pipelines
  - GenAI applications with RAG architectures for enhanced data retrieval and semantic
    search
  - AI/ML model serving infrastructure supporting fraud detection, risk assessment,
    and payment analytics
  - Feature engineering pipelines enabling machine learning models for payment security
    and optimization
