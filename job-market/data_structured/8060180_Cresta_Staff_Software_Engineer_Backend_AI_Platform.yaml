    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a platform engineering role that builds and
      maintains infrastructure (model serving stacks, training
      pipelines, Kubernetes orchestration) to enable ML/AI work
      rather than building or fine-tuning models directly. The
      role focuses on MLOps, observability, and creating platform
      primitives for research/product teams to ship models
      independently.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and maintain low-latency, highly-available serving stacks for in-house
    ML model serving and LLM integration
  - Orchestrate data prep, training, evaluation, and registry workflows on Kubernetes
    with MLOps practices
  - Profile and tune throughput, memory, and cost; introduce caching, sharding, batching,
    and GPU/CPU autoscaling
  - Create reusable SDKs, templates, and CLI tools enabling research and product teams
    to ship models independently and safely
  - Implement deep observability including tracing, metrics, alerts, and drive blameless
    post-mortems
  - Mentor engineers on production ML best practices and maintain culture of rigorous
    testing and continuous delivery
  use_cases:
  - Contact center conversation analysis and customer insights discovery
  - Behavioral best practices identification and training for contact center teams
  - Automating conversations and inefficient contact center processes
  - Real-time AI assistance for contact center agents to improve performance
  - Large language model integration for customer conversation understanding and response
