      The role focuses heavily on traditional ML/DL model
      development, training, and deployment for classification,
      prediction, NLP, and computer vision. While Generative AI is
      listed as preferred knowledge, the core responsibilities
      involve building PyTorch/TensorFlow models and MLOps
      pipelines rather than LLM-specific development.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, train, and optimize ML/DL models for classification, prediction, NLP,
    computer vision, and recommendation systems
  - Deploy ML models into production using MLOps frameworks such as Kubeflow, MLflow,
    SageMaker, Vertex AI, and Azure ML
  - Build end-to-end automated ML lifecycle pipelines including training, testing,
    deployment, and monitoring
  - Implement data pipelines for real-time and batch ML workloads with focus on feature
    extraction and data quality
  - Optimize algorithms for speed, accuracy, and cost efficiency using GPU/TPU environments
  - Implement drift detection, continuous learning, and retraining strategies for
    production models
  - Ensure compliance with ethical AI practices and regulatory frameworks while implementing
    security measures for ML models
  - Collaborate with data scientists, data engineers, and business analysts to align
    AI solutions with business outcomes
  use_cases:
  - Classification systems for enterprise data
  - Predictive analytics and forecasting models
  - Natural language processing applications
  - Computer vision solutions
  - Recommendation engines
  - Real-time and batch ML inference pipelines
