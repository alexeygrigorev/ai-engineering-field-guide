    prototyping, iteration, and production launch
  - Establish foundational components and practices for document processing, indexing,
    retrieval, orchestration, and evaluation
  - Build reliable services and APIs that are observable, secure, and designed for
    scale in a cloud environment
  - Define success metrics and drive continuous improvement via experimentation and
    data-driven decisions
  - Create durable team assets to make RAG development repeatable across products
  - Collaborate cross-functionally to translate ambiguous needs into shippable capabilities
    with clear business impact
  - Mentor teammates and contribute to engineering culture around AI systems
  use_cases:
  - Freight and transportation planning optimization
  - Data-driven logistics decision making
  - Retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-grounded AI outputs
  - Document processing and information retrieval for logistics data
  - AI-powered operational insights and revenue optimization
