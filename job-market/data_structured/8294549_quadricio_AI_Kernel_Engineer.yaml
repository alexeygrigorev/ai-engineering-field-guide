  title: AI Kernel Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on optimizing kernel library performance
      and improving the compiler toolchain for AI inference on
      Quadric's hardware platform. The engineer works on
      infrastructure that enables efficient model execution rather
      than building, training, or fine-tuning AI/LLM models
      themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop AI/LLM kernels/operators on Quadric platform for efficient inference
  - Optimize the kernel performance for different hardware configurations and workloads
  - Profile and analyze kernel performance in terms of compute, data and parallelism;
    identify micro-architecture and software bottlenecks and provide optimization
    solutions
  - Optimize kernel C/C++ codes, maximize hardware utilization
  - Collaborate across related areas of the AI inference stack to support team and
    business priorities
  - Make Improvement to Quadric toolchain, compiler and runtime
  - Provide technical support and documents to customers and developer community
  use_cases:
  - Neural network inference on edge devices
  - Smart-sensor systems with battery constraints
  - Automotive and autonomous vehicle systems
  - Real-time AI inference at the edge
  - Combined neural network and conventional DSP code execution
