      This is an AI Infrastructure Engineer role focused on
      building platforms and services that enable ML engineers and
      data scientists to train and deploy models. The role
      involves MLOps tools, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure
      automation rather than building, training, or fine-tuning
      models directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, implement, and maintain high-performance ML training and inference platforms
  - Ship MLOps tools that allow ML engineers to deploy models in minutes, not days
  - Improve scalability, reliability, and cost efficiency of model training and serving
    systems
  - Partner with researchers to turn experimental voice models into production-ready
    systems
  - Establish standards for model versioning, testing, monitoring, and governance
  - Automate data and model pipelines to reduce manual intervention and speed up experimentation
  use_cases:
  - Text-to-speech conversion for PDFs, books, documents, websites, and articles
  - Cross-platform audio generation apps for iOS, Android, Mac, Chrome, and web
  - Voice synthesis for reading assistance and accessibility
  - Low-latency audio streaming systems
  - AI-powered voice model deployment and serving
