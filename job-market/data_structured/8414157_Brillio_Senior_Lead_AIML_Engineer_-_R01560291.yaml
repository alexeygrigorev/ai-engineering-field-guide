      This is hands-on work building AI systems - specifically
      multi-agent AI architectures using LangGraph, LLM
      orchestration, and RAG. The role involves designing,
      developing, and optimizing autonomous AI agents with
      reinforcement learning, not supporting others who work on
      AI.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and develop multi-agent AI systems using LangGraph for workflow automation
    and autonomous problem-solving
  - Build memory-augmented, context-aware AI agents capable of planning, reasoning,
    and executing tasks
  - Develop and optimize agent orchestration workflows using LangGraph for high performance
    and scalability
  - Implement knowledge graphs, vector databases, and RAG techniques for enhanced
    agent reasoning
  - Apply reinforcement learning methodologies (RLHF/RLAIF) to fine-tune AI agents
    for improved decision-making
  - Lead Agentic AI proof-of-concept projects and scale successful prototypes into
    production
  - Mentor a team of AI Engineers and Data Scientists on LangGraph and multi-agent
    architectures
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise workflow automation using multi-agent AI systems
  - Autonomous problem-solving across multiple business domains
  - Complex decision-making with context-aware AI agents
  - Enhanced reasoning through RAG and knowledge graph integration
  - Self-improving AI agents that adapt based on real-time feedback
