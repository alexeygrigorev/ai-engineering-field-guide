    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a general software engineering role building the
      SDK, APIs, and infrastructure that power Symbolica's AI
      products. The engineer works on integrations, per-model
      optimizations, and context tuning, but collaborates with ML
      researchers rather than building models directly. The focus
      is on turning research prototypes into production-quality
      systems and developer tools.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and maintain Python-based systems across SDK, libraries, APIs, server-side
    platform, and integration layers
  - Work on applied AI engineering including per-model optimizations, context tuning,
    and agent-related features
  - Design developer-facing tools and libraries that customers use directly
  - Integrate with external inference providers to ensure reliability and scalability
  - Collaborate with ML researchers and engineers to turn prototypes into robust production
    systems
  - Own projects end-to-end from requirements clarification to shipping production-ready
    code
  use_cases:
  - Developer SDKs and libraries for AI model integration
  - Applied AI features including agent engineering and context tuning
  - Per-model optimization systems for inference providers
  - Production infrastructure for deploying symbolic reasoning models
  - Developer tools for building applications with Symbolica's AI
