    reasoning: |-
      This is a Data Engineer role that builds data pipelines and
      infrastructure to support AI/ML work. While the role
      involves working with Azure Machine Learning, OpenAI APIs,
      and MLOps workflows, the primary focus is on data
      engineering, cloud infrastructure, and software development
      rather than building, training, or fine-tuning AI models
      directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and maintain applications using modern programming languages
    like Python, C#, and JavaScript
  - Architect, build, and deploy secure, high-performing applications on the Azure
    platform
  - Develop and optimize data pipelines leveraging Azure Data Factory, Synapse Analytics,
    and related services
  - Build and deploy ML models using Azure Machine Learning, Cognitive Services, and
    OpenAI APIs
  - Implement MLOps workflows for model monitoring, retraining, and lifecycle management
  - Contribute to architectural decisions ensuring scalability, fault tolerance, and
    security
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise analytics and data science for strategic decision making
  - Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines
  - AI systems that solve complex real-world business problems at scale
  - Conversational AI and RAG systems using OpenAI, Hugging Face, and LangChain
  - Multi-agent architectures and ensemble strategies for AI applications
