      The role involves hands-on building, deploying, and
      maintaining AI/ML infrastructure including LLM chat
      interfaces, vector stores for RAG, and predictive ML
      workflows. The developer will directly create AI-enabled
      features, prototypes, and production APIs using LangChain
      and PyTorch, not just supporting infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Support product teams in building new AI-enabled features and rapid prototypes,
    contributing to technical vision and integrating AI/ML capabilities into product
    ideas
  - Facilitate technical interoperability between product management, data engineering,
    software engineering, and partner teams to leverage core ML and AI infrastructure
  - Develop and maintain ML and AI infrastructure including LLM chat interfaces, vector
    stores for RAG, predictive ML workflows, and MLOps tools in AWS and Snowflake
    environments
  - Contribute to data engineering by collaborating on data pipelines and product-facing
    APIs for the central data warehouse
  - Support data science and analytics projects including inferring causal factors
    of user intent, predicting user attributes, and projecting revenue
  - Deploy production-grade AI/ML APIs using FastAPI or Flask with proper model training,
    evaluation, and MLOps practices
  use_cases:
  - LLM chat interface for enhanced product interactivity and user engagement
  - RAG-based knowledge retrieval using vector stores to leverage content data
  - Predictive ML workflows with automated triggers for proactive insights
  - User intent analysis and prediction models to enhance personalization
  - Data-driven insights for editorial and marketing decision making
  - Revenue projection and causal factor analysis for business optimization
