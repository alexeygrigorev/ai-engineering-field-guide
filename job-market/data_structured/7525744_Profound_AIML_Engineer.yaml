      This role is hands-on building LLM systems including RAG,
      prompt engineering, content generation workflows, and
      evaluation frameworks. The engineer directly designs and
      deploys NLP/LLM models from data to deployment, not just
      supporting infrastructure for AI teams.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and deploy NLP models at scale for classification, ranking, clustering,
    topic extraction, and summarization
  - Design LLM workflows for context and content generation end to end, including
    topic discovery, brief creation, outlines and drafts, revision loops, and publish-ready
    assets
  - Develop prompt and template libraries aligned to brand voice and channel, including
    blogs, landing pages, help docs, and ads, with retrieval for evidence-grounded
    generation and citations
  - Create evaluation frameworks for generated content, including factuality, coverage,
    tone, safety, and originality, with rubric-based LLM evaluations, human-in-the-loop
    review, and red teaming
  - Instrument content performance across AEO and SEO visibility, engagement, and
    conversion, and run experiments to improve quality, cost, and latency
  - Transform large text datasets into production features and signals that drive
    product insights
  - Partner with engineering to instrument events, maintain data pipelines, and uphold
    high data quality and observability
  - Collaborate with product, data, and go-to-market teams on success metrics and
    experiments that move customer-facing KPIs
  use_cases:
  - AI presence management and control for companies
  - Content generation including blogs, landing pages, help docs, and ads
  - Text classification, ranking, clustering, and topic discovery for content organization
  - Content summarization and brief creation with evidence-grounded citations
  - AEO and SEO visibility optimization through AI-powered content
  - Content quality evaluation including factuality, tone, safety, and originality
