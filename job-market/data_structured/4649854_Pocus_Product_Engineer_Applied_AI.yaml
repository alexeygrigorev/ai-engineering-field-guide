      The role involves building agentic AI systems end-to-end,
      implementing intelligent agents that use LLMs and tool-use
      for reasoning and contextualizing data. The engineer is
      responsible for designing and deploying AI/ML systems that
      power real-world workflows, not just supporting
      infrastructure for other engineers.
  responsibilities:
  - Build agentic AI systems end-to-end by architecting and implementing intelligent
    agents that extract insights from fragmented data sources
  - Engineer an extensible AI platform with flexible data ingestion, semantic enrichment,
    query engine, and workflow orchestration layers
  - Prototype, iterate, and ship quickly with deep autonomy to test ideas and own
    systems that impact customers directly
  - Prioritize security and reliability by handling sensitive customer data with best-in-class
    security practices
  - Elevate the engineering bar through clean abstractions, fast feedback loops, thoughtful
    testing, and excellent developer tooling
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered prospecting platform that automates manual research and outreach tasks
    for sales teams
  - Real-time alerts and account plan generation powered by AI agents monitoring compelling
    events
  - Next best action recommendations using intelligent agents that reason over structured
    and semi-structured data
  - Automated workflows connecting to sales tools like Slack, Outreach, and CRMs via
    APIs and webhooks
  - Semantic enrichment and transformation of customer data from warehouses, databases,
    and public datasets
