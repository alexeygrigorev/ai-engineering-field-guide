      This role involves hands-on work building LLM-powered
      extraction pipelines, implementing RAG systems, and
      deploying agentic workflows with tool/function-calling. The
      engineer directly works on LLM systems, fine-tuning models,
      and optimizing inference at scale - not just providing
      infrastructure support.
  responsibilities:
  - Build automated content discovery pipelines that acquire grant-related content
    from foundation websites and RFPs
  - transforming web content into structured data
  - Implement LLM extraction pipelines that convert unstructured documents (PDFs,
    HTML, Word) into canonical business objects using OCR, table extraction, and layout-aware
    parsing
  - Design and maintain semantic chunking strategies, embedding model selection, and
    vector indices that power search and RAG features
  - Optimize LLM systems for cost and latency at scale through token profiling, caching,
    batching, and model selection strategies
  - Implement data quality validation, anomaly detection, and alerting for extraction
    drift while serving clean data to product teams via APIs and event streams
  - Integrate and normalize data from external providers by resolving entities and
    mapping to internal schemas
  use_cases:
  - Grant discovery and matching for nonprofit organizations
  - Automated extraction of structured data from unstructured grant documents and
    foundation profiles
  - Enterprise search over grant-related content using vector embeddings and RAG
  - Data normalization and entity resolution across multiple grant data sources
  - Content ingestion and processing from web sources at scale
