    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role explicitly requires building AI agent-based
      systems, agent workflows, and orchestration logic using
      modern LLM frameworks like LangGraph and LangChain. This is
      hands-on work with AI systems (building, deploying,
      implementing agents) rather than supporting infrastructure
      or platforms for AI work.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and maintain AI agent-based systems that perform multi-step tasks
    using defined goals, tools, and decision logic
  - Design, build, and maintain full-stack web applications including React-based
    UIs with thoughtful component architecture and performance optimization
  - Design, develop, and maintain backend services, RESTful APIs, and data models
  - Architect scalable systems and contribute to high-level design and planning
  - Drive code quality, testing, and engineering best practices across the team
  - Collaborate across functions to deliver end-to-end product features
  use_cases:
  - Multi-step task automation using AI agents with tool calling and orchestration
  - Stateful workflows for AI-driven business applications
  - Real-time intelligence and interactive business applications
  - Data-driven decision support for financial services, insurance, technology, media,
    and sports
  - Marketing, operations, and product development optimization
