    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on building and deploying AI
      systems including LLM integration, RAG implementation, and
      multi-step AI workflow chains. The engineer will directly
      work with models, prompts, embeddings, and vector databases
      to create user-facing AI features, not just supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build user-facing AI capabilities that simplify decision-making and
    surface insights for operational teams
  - Create and maintain multi-step LLM workflows combining prompts, tools, and data
    to execute complex tasks
  - Implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to combine internal data with LLMs
    for context-aware results
  - Take AI features from prototype to production with focus on scalability, cost-efficiency,
    and observability
  - Set standards and best practices for trustworthy, scalable AI implementation across
    the organization
  - Work cross-functionally with product, engineering, and data teams to deliver AI-driven
    product experiences
  use_cases:
  - User-facing AI capabilities for decision support and insights in restaurant operations
  - Conversational agents and data-powered assistants for automating operational tasks
  - RAG-powered systems that combine restaurant data with LLMs for context-aware recommendations
  - AI workflows that surface actionable insights from operational data for faster
    decision-making
  - Automated process improvements through intelligent multi-step AI pipelines
