      This role focuses exclusively on reinforcement learning
      algorithms and applied machine learning, working directly
      with model design, training, and evaluation. While it
      involves sophisticated AI techniques, it centers on
      traditional ML approaches (policy gradients, Q-learning,
      actor-critic models) rather than modern generative AI or LLM
      technologies.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, implement, and tune reinforcement learning algorithms to support decision
    making and behavior modeling in simulation environments
  - Define and refine reward functions, state representations, and action spaces aligned
    to mission objectives
  - Build and maintain training environments and experimentation pipelines for reinforcement
    learning agents
  - Evaluate agent performance using rigorous metrics such as convergence, sample
    efficiency, robustness, and stability
  - Analyze training outcomes and simulation results to recommend changes to models,
    scenarios, or learning approaches
  - Collaborate closely with modeling and simulation engineers and software teams
    to integrate RL components into the baseline
  - Ensure AI and ML components are transparent, testable, and maintainable within
    the broader system architecture
  - Support test events, demonstrations, and technical reviews by clearly communicating
    AI and ML behavior and results
  use_cases:
  - Reinforcement learning for decision making and behavior modeling in simulation
    environments
  - AI-enabled capabilities for mission-critical modeling and simulation
  - Training and evaluating RL agents for operational scenarios
  - Integration of RL components into larger software and modeling systems
  - Supporting analytical depth and capability modernization across the portfolio
