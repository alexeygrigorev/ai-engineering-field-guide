  title: 'Machine Learning Engineer Intern: 3D Generative AI (Q1 2026)'
  ai_type:
    type: ml-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is hands-on ML focused on 3D computer vision and
      generative models for avatar creation. The role involves
      designing, training, fine-tuning, and deploying ML models
      using PyTorch/TensorFlow for 3D asset synthesis, mesh
      generation, and graphics. While it works with AI for content
      generation, it's centered on traditional ML/DL frameworks
      and computer graphics rather than LLMs or agents, making it
      ml-first.
  responsibilities:
  - Collaborate with R&D and Application teams to integrate AI/ML solutions into avatar
    creation ecosystem using 3D computer vision and computer graphics techniques
  - Design, train, fine-tune, accelerate, optimize, and deploy ML models and technical
    frameworks for 3D asset production
  - Utilize computer graphics pipelines, computational geometry, and 3D principles
    to synthesize meshes, images, and motion
  - Implement white paper concepts to develop user-facing creative technologies and
    tools
  - Manage ML framework resources and infrastructure including dataset management,
    cloud computing, experiment tracking, and model deployment
  - Partner with Product and Creative teams to refine AI/ML-powered creation tools
    and interfaces
  - Communicate technical decisions and project updates to cross-functional stakeholders
  - Stay up-to-date on emerging AI technologies and advise on strategic integration
  use_cases:
  - AI avatar generation and customization for digital identity
  - 3D asset and mesh synthesis for avatar creation
  - User-generated content platform for avatar ecosystems
  - Social gaming experiences powered by AI avatars
  - Digital self-expression and identity representation
  - Cross-platform avatar interoperability
