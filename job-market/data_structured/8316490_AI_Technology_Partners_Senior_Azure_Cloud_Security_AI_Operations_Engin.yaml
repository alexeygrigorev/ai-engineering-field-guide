    reasoning: |-
      The role is an Azure Cloud, Security & AI Operations
      Engineer focused on infrastructure, security, and DevOps.
      While the company delivers generative AI solutions and the
      engineer uses LLMs to accelerate workflows, the primary
      responsibilities involve building and maintaining Azure
      platforms, security operations, and observability - not
      building, training, or deploying AI models directly. This is
      an infrastructure/platform role that supports AI workloads
      rather than developing them.
  responsibilities:
  - Own and evolve Azure foundations including subscription strategy, landing zones,
    networking, identity, secrets management, and data services
  - Design and implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps with
    Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Bicep)
  - Operate and automate security monitoring, threat detection, vulnerability scanning,
    and compliance frameworks
  - Establish SRE practices including SLOs/SLIs, observability, incident response,
    and auto-remediation workflows
  - Use LLMs and code generation to accelerate infrastructure and operations workflows
    like pipeline scaffolding and runbook creation
  - Work directly with enterprise clients to translate requirements into secure, reliable
    designs and guide adoption
  use_cases:
  - Deploying and managing secure generative AI solutions for enterprise clients
  - Running Azure OpenAI (GPT-4.1) workloads in production with robust security controls
  - Implementing RAG pipelines with LibreChat and MeiliSearch for enterprise AI applications
  - Managing vector search and multi-cloud AI provider integrations (OpenAI, Google
    Gemini, Cohere)
  - Supporting secure, compliant AI infrastructure that meets enterprise regulatory
    requirements
