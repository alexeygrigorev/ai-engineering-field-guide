      This role focuses on building infrastructure and platforms
      that enable GenAI capabilities rather than directly
      building, training, or fine-tuning models. The
      responsibilities emphasize platform components like model
      gateways, vector databases, monitoring, and CI/CD pipelines
      that support other teams working with AI.

  - Design, build, and maintain the core infrastructure layer supporting GenAI products,
    including model gateways, prompt/versioning stores, vector databases, and LLM
    evaluation tools
  - Implement secure access controls and authentication mechanisms integrated by default
    into the AI platform components
  - Develop and manage observability, monitoring, and logging solutions for GenAI
    workloads and infrastructure
  - Collaborate closely with product and engineering teams to integrate GenAI infrastructure
    with agent frameworks and downstream applications
  - Optimize infrastructure for scalability, high availability, and cost efficiency
    for production workloads
  use_cases:
  - Seamless delivery of AI-generated insights into agent workflows
  - Integration of GenAI capabilities with existing products
  - Safe and scalable AI product delivery
  - Real-time monitoring and performance of GenAI workloads
