      This role involves directly designing, implementing, and
      training AI models for perception, inspection, decision-
      making, and control on real robotic systems. The engineer is
      responsible for deploying ML models on production hardware,
      working with synthetic data generation using generative AI
      techniques, and implementing reinforcement learning for
      robotic control - all hands-on model development and
      deployment work.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, implement, and train state-of-the-art AI models for perception, inspection,
    decision-making, and control in real-world robotic manufacturing systems
  - Lead the development of simulation-based tooling for reinforcement learning, synthetic
    data generation, and autonomous robotic cell setup
  - Own and advance synthetic data generation pipelines using generative AI techniques
    for complex 3D geometry, physics-based simulation, and image data
  - Develop and deploy multi-modal inspection and health monitoring systems integrating
    vision, 3D sensing, and force/torque sensors
  - Bridge the gap between simulation and reality, ensuring models trained in simulation
    transfer robustly to physical robotic cells
  - Optimize, deploy, and maintain ML models on production robotic systems considering
    latency, reliability, and hardware constraints
  use_cases:
  - Automated surface finishing tasks in manufacturing environments
  - Perception and inspection systems for robotic quality assurance
  - Synthetic data generation for training robotic perception models
  - Reinforcement learning for recipe learning and process optimization
  - Multi-modal sensor fusion for robotic control and monitoring
  - Simulation-to-reality transfer for robust robot deployment in high-mix manufacturing
