      This is a DevOps Engineer role focused on infrastructure and
      platform support for an AI team. The responsibilities
      involve deploying and managing infrastructure, CI/CD
      pipelines, and observability for AI/LLM solutions, but not
      building, training, or fine-tuning models directly. The role
      enables the AI/ML work of others by providing the underlying
      cloud infrastructure, automation, and deployment systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Expand and manage application hosting across AWS and Google Cloud, ensuring performance,
    flexibility, and resilience
  - Develop and maintain Terraform or similar IaC installers for Azure and GCP to
    fully automate infrastructure deployments
  - Design and implement AWS cost optimization strategies including reserved instances,
    right-sizing, and resource efficiency initiatives
  - Strengthen infrastructure security with robust access controls, encryption, monitoring,
    and alerting frameworks
  - Build and enhance monitoring platforms with Grafana dashboards and Prometheus
    alerts for real-time performance insights
  - Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and optimize Ingress controllers for
    enhanced security and delivery resilience
  - Create Python and Bash scripts to automate repetitive tasks, streamline workflows,
    and improve operational efficiency
  - Deploy and manage LLM-related solutions requiring MCP, LangFuse, Airflow, GraphDB,
    VectorDB, and Redis
  use_cases:
  - Hybrid observability platform for digital infrastructure monitoring
  - Real-time performance insights and proactive issue resolution for IT infrastructure
  - LLM solution deployment and infrastructure support
  - Internal self-hosted AI services management
  - Multi-cloud infrastructure orchestration and optimization
