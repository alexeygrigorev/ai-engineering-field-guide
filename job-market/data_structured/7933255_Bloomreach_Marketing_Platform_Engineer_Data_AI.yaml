      This role builds the data infrastructure and API backbone
      that enables AI agents to function, rather than building,
      training, or deploying the AI models themselves. The
      engineer is responsible for data pipelines, context
      retrieval systems, and API architecture that support AI
      operations - this is enabling work for AI systems, not
      hands-on AI/ML development.
  responsibilities:
  - Own Salesforce data integrity including data quality, deduplication, and enrichment
    while maintaining the single source of truth
  - Engineer the context retrieval backbone by designing versioned, documented API
    endpoints for GTM agents
  - Optimize retrieval performance through tuning query logic, filters, boosts, and
    ranking algorithms for sub-second latency
  - Scale GTM Brain data sources by integrating new sources without disrupting existing
    agents
  - Maintain context freshness through background jobs, re-embeddings, and data pipelines
    that prevent drift
  - Enable agent developers with starter queries and templated context patterns for
    rapid adoption
  - Collaborate on vendor strategy integrating tools like N8N, Clay, and Rattle into
    the context architecture
  - Build the GTM data stack coordinating with RevOps and AI Ops on Salesforce, enrichment
    platforms, and LLM tools integration
  use_cases:
  - Conversational shopping assistant providing personalized product guidance
  - Autonomous search for intuitive product discovery
  - AI-powered autonomous marketing workflow automation
  - Real-time customer journey personalization across touchpoints
  - Sales and marketing agent context retrieval and intelligence
  - Data enrichment and deduplication for customer relationship management
