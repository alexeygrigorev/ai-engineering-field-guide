      This is a Forward Deployed/Enablement Engineer role that
      helps customers adopt AI tools (Devin, Windsurf) and
      integrate agentic workflows. The engineer teaches others to
      use AI systems and provides infrastructure enablement rather
      than building, training, or fine-tuning the AI models
      themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead interactive programs for enterprise engineering teams including live workshops
    and pair programming sessions
  - Guide customers through installing, configuring, and optimizing Devin and associated
    tools like DeepWiki and MCP integrations
  - Pair-program with engineers at varying experience levels to help them build, debug,
    and automate real projects
  - Identify high-ROI workflows for Devin across engineering, QA, support, data, and
    product teams
  - Create enablement materials, best practices, and shared playbooks based on customer
    learnings
  - Collaborate with leadership to scale AI Enablement into a repeatable productized
    offering through digital learning and partner certifications
  - Work with Engagement Managers and Engineering teams to refine onboarding and provide
    feedback on new features
  use_cases:
  - AI software engineering agents that can build end-to-end software
  - AI-native IDEs for collaborative development workflows
  - Agentic workflows integrated into day-to-day development processes
  - Automated coding, debugging, and project assistance for engineering teams
  - Knowledge management through DeepWiki and tool integrations via MCP
  - Scalable AI adoption and enablement programs for enterprise engineering organizations
