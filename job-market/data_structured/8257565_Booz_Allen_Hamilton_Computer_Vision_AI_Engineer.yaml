position:
  title: Computer Vision AI Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ml-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on traditional computer vision and deep
      learning models (DINO, CLIP, SAM) for sensor fusion and
      target tracking, not generative AI or LLMs. The engineer
      will train, test, deploy, and optimize these CV models using
      GPU programming and embedded systems - classic ML/DL work
      applied to computer vision domains.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and implement deep learning computer vision models with focus on sensor
    fusion and target tracking
  - Collaborate with multidisciplinary teams to design, develop, test, and deploy
    technical solutions in Python, C++, and Rust
  - Develop and maintain Fire Control Systems ensuring robustness and accuracy in
    real-time applications
  - Utilize GPU programming including CUDA or RAPIDs to optimize performance of computer
    vision applications
  - Contribute to architecture and implementation of embedded systems programming
    using C, C++, or Rust
  use_cases:
  - Missile warning problems in near-real-time
  - Sensor fusion for space-based solutions
  - Target tracking systems
  - Fire control systems for real-time applications
  - Computer vision for embedded systems
