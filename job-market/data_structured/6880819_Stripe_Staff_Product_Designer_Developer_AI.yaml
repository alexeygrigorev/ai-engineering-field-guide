      This is a Product Designer role focused on designing AI-
      powered developer tools and experiences. The role involves
      creating the user interface and interaction patterns for AI
      tools, but does not involve building, training, or deploying
      models - the actual AI engineering is handled by the
      engineering team the designer works alongside.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and prototype innovative new developer tools and experiences powered by
    AI from the ground up
  - Apply understanding of the AI industry to craft AI experiences for developers
  - Create boundary-pushing AI experiences and interaction models that set new industry
    standards
  - Turn ambiguous developer-facing problems into concrete products from proposal
    through launch
  - Build with AI tools directly and prototype ideas using these tools as part of
    the design process
  - Shape the developer experience roadmap alongside engineers by pitching new ideas
  - Work cross-functionally with Developer Products, Connect, Merchant Experience
    and other teams to uplevel developer experiences
  - Advocate for AI capabilities across internal teams and participate in design reviews
    with leadership
  use_cases:
  - Streamline and automate building and maintaining Stripe integrations using LLMs
    and AI
  - Re-imagine the zero-to-one integration experience for developers building on Stripe
    APIs
  - Bring Stripe knowledge including docs, reference and support to developer fingertips
    through tools like MCP server
  - Partner with tools like v0 to help users get set up and taking payments in minutes
    rather than weeks
  - Reduce pain of API migrations and upgrades using AI tools to automate the process
  - Explore new ways AI can improve overall Developer Experience beyond current patterns
