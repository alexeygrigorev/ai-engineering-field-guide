  title: Backend Engineer, AI
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      The role focuses on building backend systems, orchestration
      layers, and inference pipelines that power AI features, but
      does not involve training, fine-tuning, or directly
      developing models. The engineer works on infrastructure,
      APIs, and production concerns (latency, reliability,
      monitoring) to serve existing LLMs rather than building or
      deploying models themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and operate backend systems that serve AI-powered features in production
  - Design inference pipelines, orchestration layers, and service boundaries around
    models
  - Own production concerns including monitoring, logging, alerting, and incident
    response
  - Optimize latency and throughput across inference, caching, batching, and streaming
  use_cases:
  - Proactive AI system that carries work forward across conversations, tools, and
    time
  - AI-powered features that require model orchestration across multiple interactions
  - Real-time inference serving with high throughput and low latency requirements
