      The role involves direct hands-on implementation of LLM
      systems, including prompt engineering, secure LLM
      interactions, and developing Model Context Protocol (MCP)
      servers that form the backbone of an AI-driven platform. The
      engineer is building infrastructure and tools to enable LLM-
      based applications for trading strategy analysis, not just
      supporting existing AI work.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, test, and deploy robust and scalable MCP servers and related
    tools in Python
  - Enhance existing MCPs to ensure reliable access to strategy metadata, historical
    PnL data, and PnL attribution by risk factors
  - Develop new MCPs for direct data system integration, strategy analytics, and performance
    reporting
  - Design and implement secure prompt engineering techniques to interact with LLMs
    while protecting intellectual property
  - Work on API development and integration ensuring seamless data flow between internal
    systems and data warehouses
  - Implement data parsing and manipulation logic for various formats and contribute
    to data pipelines for strategy metrics
  use_cases:
  - AI-assisted insights for Portfolio Managers to analyze trading strategies more
    efficiently
  - Natural language interfaces to query and maintain financial strategies using LLMs
  - Automated routine analytical tasks for strategy management and performance analysis
  - Secure access to proprietary strategy data, PnL attribution, and risk factor analysis
    through AI-driven tools
