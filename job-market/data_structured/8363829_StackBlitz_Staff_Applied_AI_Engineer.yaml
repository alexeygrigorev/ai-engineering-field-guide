      This is a hands-on AI engineering role working directly with
      LLMs to build AI agent systems. The engineer will lead the
      design and evolution of AI agent architectures, work with
      OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google models, and implement systems
      that enable agents to generate full-stack applications from
      natural language - this is core AI development, not support
      work.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the design and evolution of AI agent systems, establishing patterns, frameworks,
    and standards for how agents manage context and orchestrate workflows
  - Shape the multi-provider strategy for LLM models (OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude,
    Google Gemini) and establish evaluation frameworks and selection criteria
  - Architect foundational systems for tool use and workflow orchestration, enabling
    AI agents to safely call external tools and APIs
  - Partner across engineering, product, and design teams to align AI initiatives
    with business objectives and influence roadmaps
  - Establish data and evaluation standards for collecting and analyzing agent responses,
    building evaluation harnesses that support business KPIs
  - Drive research and innovation in NLP and LLM techniques, including prompting strategies,
    context handling methods, and fine-tuning opportunities
  use_cases:
  - Convert natural language into production-ready full-stack web and mobile applications
  - Maintain context across large codebases while making changes, from simple UI tweaks
    to complex architectural decisions
  - Orchestrate multi-step workflows that handle increasingly complex user needs across
    the application development process
  - Enable safe and effective tool use by AI agents for web searches, database queries,
    and domain-specific operations
  - Provide instant code generation and editing capabilities directly in the browser
    without requiring traditional code writing
