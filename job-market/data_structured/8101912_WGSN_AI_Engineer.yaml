  title: AI Engineer

    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work building and deploying LLM
      and multimodal models, implementing RAG systems, and
      designing inference services. The engineer is directly
      responsible for taking AI/LLM models from prototype to
      production, including building evaluation frameworks, vector
      search infrastructure, and monitoring systems - all core
      AI/ML development tasks rather than supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Build, deploy and maintain production-grade LLM and multimodal models
  - Design and implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, semantic search
    pipelines, embeddings, and vector search infrastructure
  - Design and develop robust APIs and microservices to expose AI functionality into
    WGSN products
  - Build scalable inference infrastructure using Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS services
  - Develop CI/CD pipelines for model deployment, versioning, evaluation and rollback
  - Implement and maintain monitoring for latency, throughput, drift, hallucinations,
    quality, reliability and operational cost
  - Build automated evaluation pipelines, test suites and guardrail systems to ensure
    safe, predictable model behaviour
  - Collaborate with data scientists, data engineers, platform engineers and product
    teams to embed models into production features
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise trend forecasting and consumer insights
  - Fashion and design trend analysis
  - Product design recommendation systems
  - Consumer behavior prediction and analysis
  - Multimodal content search and retrieval
