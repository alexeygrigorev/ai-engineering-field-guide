    reasoning: |-
      This is a Data Engineer role focused on building data
      infrastructure, pipelines, and services that support AI/ML
      efforts rather than building, training, or deploying models
      directly. The role involves creating ETL pipelines, feature
      stores, and data APIs to enable AI/ML engineers and data
      scientists to work with the data.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and maintain ETL/ELT pipelines for structured and unstructured
    data to support AI/ML model and application development, evaluation, and monitoring
  - Build and optimize data processing workflows in Databricks, AWS SageMaker, or
    similar cloud platforms
  - Collaborate with AI/ML engineers to deliver clean, reliable datasets for model
    training and inference
  - Implement data quality, observability, and lineage tracking within the ML lifecycle
  - Develop Data APIs/microservices to power AI applications and reporting/analytics
    dashboards
  - Support the deployment of AI/ML applications by building and maintaining feature
    stores and data pipelines optimized for production workloads
  - Ensure adherence to CR's data governance, security, and compliance standards across
    all AI and data workflows
  - Integrate data from multiple internal and external systems, including APIs, third-party
    datasets, and cloud storage
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered consumer product ratings and reviews
  - Generative AI applications for enhancing consumer insights and recommendations
  - Machine learning models for analyzing consumer trends and marketplace challenges
  - Analytics dashboards for reporting on consumer survey data and testing results
  - Data-driven advocacy tools for identifying and addressing marketplace harms
  - Feature stores and data infrastructure supporting production AI/ML workloads
