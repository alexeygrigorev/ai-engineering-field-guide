position:
  title: Principal AI Research Engineer - World Models
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is hands-on AI/ML work focused on building and
      training world models (large-scale video/world models like
      Sora/Veo) and turning them into controllable simulators for
      robotics. The engineer will work directly on model
      architecture, training, and evaluation - not supporting
      infrastructure or data pipelines for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and train large-scale video/world models (like Sora, Veo) for robotics
    applications
  - Turn generative models into controllable simulators with action-/state-conditioned
    rollouts
  - Build data and evaluation infrastructure for world modeling to quantify downstream
    policy success
  - Develop systems to achieve 99.99% success rates in real robot deployments
  - Work with proprietary robotics datasets to train increasingly capable AI systems
  - Contribute to the human-intervention + RL product feedback loop
  use_cases:
  - Automating dangerous and repetitive tasks in manufacturing and logistics
  - Loading items into boxes and containers with high precision
  - Lifting and moving heavy objects (e.g., 40 lb bags) in retail settings
  - Real-time teleoperation system allowing remote control of robots
  - Collecting high-quality demonstrations at scale for training
  - Achieving 99.99% success rates for real-world robot deployments to ensure zero
    errors
