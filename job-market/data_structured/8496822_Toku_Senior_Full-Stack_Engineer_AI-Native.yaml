    reasoning: |-
      This is an AI-native full-stack engineering role where AI
      agents are used as the primary interface for software
      development across the SDLC. However, the engineer is
      building traditional financial/payroll infrastructure
      systems, not AI/ML models or AI products themselves. The
      role uses AI tools to accelerate development but does not
      involve building, deploying, or fine-tuning AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and ship full-stack features across frontend and backend systems
  - Own work end-to-end from product requirements to deployment and monitoring
  - Use AI agents to accelerate delivery while improving reliability and maintainability
  - Partner closely with product, design, and operations to deliver high-impact outcomes
  - Improve internal engineering workflows for AI-native development and team leverage
  use_cases:
  - Global payroll processing and payments infrastructure
  - Stablecoin, fiat, and token-based payroll disbursements
  - API integration with payroll platforms like ADP, Gusto, and Workday
  - Financial operations and token administration systems
