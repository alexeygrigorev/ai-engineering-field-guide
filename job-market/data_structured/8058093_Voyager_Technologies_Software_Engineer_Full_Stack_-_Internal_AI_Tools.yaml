  title: Software Engineer – Full Stack - Internal AI Tools Team
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a full-stack web engineering role focused on
      building UI/frontend tools for AI agents, not building or
      deploying AI models directly. The engineer creates
      visualization interfaces, dashboards, and collaboration
      features to interact with AI systems, but does not train,
      fine-tune, or implement the underlying models or agents.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build web applications that serve as mission control for ACE, with
    focus on responsiveness and usability for expert users
  - Implement high-fidelity 2D/3D visualizations of CAD models, PCB layouts, and CFD
    fields using Three.js, WebGL, or WebGPU
  - Create features that expose agent reasoning, tool usage, and design history in
    transparent and intuitive ways for engineers
  - Develop real-time collaborative editing and review workflows using WebSockets
    or CRDTs for human-AI co-design
  - Collaborate with backend, platform, and domain team members to design APIs and
    data contracts that power the UI
  - Manage agentic teams of LLMs to scaffold components, generate documentation, and
    accelerate development
  use_cases:
  - Agentic AI platform for computational engineering that compresses hardware development
    cycles from years to days
  - AI-native design system integrating Design for Manufacturing, Design for Assembly,
    and Design for Test into initial design stages
  - Real-time collaboration between human engineers and AI agents for hardware and
    CAD design workflows
  - Visualization and control interface for steering AI agents working on physics
    simulations and hardware development
  - Transparent AI agent reasoning and action tracking for engineering decision-making
    and review processes
