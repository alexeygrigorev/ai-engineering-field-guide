      This is a software engineering role building full-stack
      features for data operations platforms, not building or
      deploying AI models directly. The role involves designing
      front-end, back-end, and infrastructure systems that support
      Scale's AI data pipeline and operations, which is
      infrastructure/platform work that enables others to work
      with AI.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement features end-to-end across front-end, back-end, and infrastructure
  - Build features using TypeScript, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Temporal for compute
    orchestration
  - Own high-impact technical systems critical to Scale's revenue delivery
  - Build and iterate on complex systems scaling to millions of tasks per week
  - Collaborate with model teams, Forward Deployed Engineers, and cross-functional
    stakeholders
  - Help shape engineering culture, values, and best practices
  use_cases:
  - RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) for LLM training and alignment
  - Human data generation for generative AI model development
  - Model evaluation, safety, and alignment for enterprise and government customers
  - High-impact dataset creation pushing boundaries of LLM capabilities
  - Contributor onboarding and incentive optimization for data operations
  - Trust, safety, and security measures for data integrity
