      This role involves hands-on development and deployment of
      deep learning models for computer vision perception systems
      in robotics. The engineer will work across the full ML
      lifecycle including model development, optimization,
      training, and real-time deployment, which directly aligns
      with building AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and optimize deep learning models for object detection, segmentation,
    tracking, and 3D scene understanding using multi-modal sensor data
  - Build scalable pipelines for data processing, training, evaluation, and deployment
    into real-world and real-time systems
  - Design labeling strategies and tooling for automated annotation, QA workflows,
    dataset management, augmentation, and versioning
  - Implement monitoring and reliability frameworks, including uncertainty estimation,
    failure detection, and automated performance reporting
  - Conduct proof-of-concept experiments to evaluate new algorithms and perception
    techniques; translate research insights into practical prototypes
  - Collaborate with robotics, systems, and simulation teams to integrate perception
    models into production pipelines and improve end-to-end performance
  use_cases:
  - General purpose robotic intelligence for widespread deployment
  - Real-world robotics and automation perception systems
  - Multi-modal sensor fusion for scene understanding
  - Robust perception adapting to unseen scenarios
  - Real-time computer vision for robotics applications
