      The role involves hands-on AI/ML engineering including
      building REAL.AI consumer intelligence engine, implementing
      predictive modeling, personalization algorithms, and
      recommendation systems. The engineer will integrate
      OpenAI/LangChain APIs, develop LLM-powered features, and
      work with TensorFlow/PyTorch - directly building and
      deploying AI models, not just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead technical implementation of REAL.AI consumer intelligence engine including
    data modeling, predictive algorithms, and personalized recommendation pipelines
  - Architect and build loyalty program infrastructure that ties user behaviors to
    rewards and predictive engagement cycles
  - Collaborate with mobile team to implement AI-driven personalization across feeds,
    notifications, and product recommendations
  - Develop and integrate API layers between Firebase, Zoho CRM, Segment, Voucherify,
    and internal data warehouse (GCP)
  - Build scalable backend services supporting dynamic campaigns, A/B tests, and loyalty
    redemptions
  - Partner cross-functionally with data science, marketing, and product design to
    translate consumer behavior into actionable features
  - Optimize performance, ensure data integrity, and design systems for scalability
    across millions of users
  use_cases:
  - Consumer intelligence engine for predicting user intent and behavior
  - Personalized recommendation systems for feeds, notifications, and products
  - Gesture-based loyalty experiences with predictive engagement cycles
  - Real-time campaign optimization using behavioral data
  - Emotional intelligence-driven experiences that adapt to user interactions
  - First-party data segmentation and behavior scoring for marketing
