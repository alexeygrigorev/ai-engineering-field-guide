    reasoning: |-
      This is an SRE role that focuses on infrastructure,
      reliability, and operational health of AI systems rather
      than building, training, or fine-tuning models. The engineer
      collaborates with ML researchers but works on distributed
      systems, monitoring, and deployment infrastructure to
      support AI workloads.
  responsibilities:
  - Own the reliability, performance, and operational health of production AI systems,
    focusing on improving complex, existing services
  - Lead efforts to refactor and harden the AI codebase to improve observability,
    maintainability, and resilience
  - Diagnose and resolve issues across distributed systems, including latency, throughput,
    data pipelines, and resource utilization
  - Design and build monitoring, alerting, and debugging tools for high-availability
    services
  - Partner with researchers and ML engineers to productionize models at scale
  - Establish best practices for testing, deployment, capacity planning, and incident
    response
  - Serve as a technical leader during on-call rotations, driving incident response,
    postmortems, and continuous system improvements
  use_cases:
  - Real-time threat detection for known and unknown cybersecurity threats across
    cloud, hybrid, and on-premises environments
  - Self-supervised AI systems that automatically learn and adapt to dynamic network
    environments
  - Scalable cybersecurity monitoring for large organizations with big data workloads
  - Protecting critical infrastructure and government/defense assets from cyber threats
  - Context-aware anomaly detection in network traffic patterns
