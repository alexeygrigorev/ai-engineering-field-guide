      The role involves building backend systems specifically for
      AI agents, including designing APIs for LLMs, optimizing for
      AI inference patterns, and managing LLM context. While it's
      backend-focused, the work is directly ON AI systems -
      building infrastructure that powers agentic chat and enables

  - Build infrastructure and APIs that enable AI agents to access and process platform
    data at scale
  - Develop data pipelines and integration layers optimized for generative AI workloads
    and inference patterns
  - Deploy and maintain AWS-hosted SaaS systems with automated CI/CD pipelines
  - Support production operations and ensure reliability of AI-powered systems
  - Collaborate across teams to provide technical expertise and drive AI platform
    adoption
  use_cases:
  - Agentic chat interface that provides expert insights to engineering leaders
  - AI-powered analytics across the entire Jellyfish platform
  - Large-scale data processing for generative AI applications
  - Context-aware LLM integration for engineering decision support
  - AI tools that help align engineering decisions with business initiatives
