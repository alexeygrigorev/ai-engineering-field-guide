company:
  name: Sixfold
  stage: Early-stage
  focus: AI platform for insurance risk evaluation and pricing
position:
  title: Software Engineer, AI
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work with generative AI and LLMs,
      including building RAG systems, fine-tuning prompts,
      designing evaluation metrics, and implementing LLM
      workflows. The engineer will directly work on the AI
      pipeline that powers risk evaluation agents, not supporting
      infrastructure or platforms for other AI workers.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and deploy code across the AI pipeline using Python and generative AI/ML
    tools
  - Work with large language models, fine-tune prompts, design evaluation metrics,
    and implement responsible AI practices
  - Develop full-stack features using Ruby on Rails, React, and TypeScript to integrate
    AI capabilities with web app and APIs
  - Collaborate cross-functionally with product managers, designers, and engineers
    through problem discovery, solution design, and delivery
  - Own software through entire lifecycle from problem identification and technical
    specs to deployment and on-call support
  - Assess pressing product and engineering problems, identify solutions, write technical
    specs, and scope projects
  use_cases:
  - AI agents that understand risk evaluation similar to veteran underwriters
  - Analyzing location-specific risks (e.g., bakery in Florida vs Montana)
  - Detecting risk profile changes when companies pivot business models (e.g., toys
    to medical devices)
  - Making million-dollar underwriting decisions with AI intuition
  - Processing billions in insurance premium for major carriers
