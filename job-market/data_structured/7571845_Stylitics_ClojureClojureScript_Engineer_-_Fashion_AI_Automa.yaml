  focus: AI-powered visual outfitting and styling for retail
position:
  title: Clojure/ClojureScript Engineer - Fashion AI Automation
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is an AI-first role as the engineer builds, deploys,
      and orchestrates AI systems directly: integrating LLM APIs,
      managing prompts and context windows, implementing RAG
      pipelines with Qdrant, building MCP/tool-calling
      architectures, and coordinating multi-step AI workflows for
      image generation, product attribution, and copy writing. The
      hands-on work with models, vector search, and AI workflow
      orchestration clearly places this in the ai-first category.
  responsibilities:
  - Build Temporal workflows that orchestrate multi-step AI operations including product
    attribution, copy generation, image generation, and outfit creation
  - Develop backend services in Clojure that integrate with LLM APIs, manage context
    and prompts, handle streaming responses, and process structured outputs
  - Design data models and PostgreSQL schemas supporting complex AI workflows, vector
    embeddings, and integration with the product catalog
  - Implement RAG pipelines using Qdrant for semantic search, similarity matching,
    and context retrieval for smarter AI recommendations
  - Create MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations and tool-calling architectures
    enabling LLMs to query data and trigger system actions
  - Build ClojureScript UIs for review workflows where humans validate, edit, and
    improve AI-generated content
  - Develop APIs and data pipelines that connect systems, monitor AI quality, and
    support fast iteration
  use_cases:
  - Generate outfit images at scale using AI workflows that coordinate LLMs, image
    generation, and human review loops
  - Automatically write product copy and product attribution for retail catalogs
  - Enable semantic discovery across fashion catalogs using vector search architectures
  - Coordinate intelligent review flows where humans and AI collaborate to produce
    millions of styled recommendations
  - Power visual outfitting and styling recommendations across e-commerce, email,
    advertising, stores, and social media channels
