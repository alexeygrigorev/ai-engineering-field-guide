      This role involves hands-on building and deployment of AI
      agents, LLM workflows, RAG pipelines, and automation
      solutions. The engineer designs end-to-end AI systems using
      OpenAI APIs, vector databases, LangGraph, and agent
      frameworks - directly implementing model-driven solutions
      rather than just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and deploy tailored AI and automation solutions based on client-specific
    needs and objectives
  - Translate ambiguous business problems into scalable, end-to-end AI workflows using
    Python, n8n, OpenAI APIs, and vector databases
  - Build full end-to-end AI automations, including triggers, LLM logic, API calls,
    data storage, error handling, monitoring, and iteration
  - Design and deploy AI agent systems, including multi-step workflows that call tools,
    interact with APIs, and operate autonomously
  - Integrate with third-party AI tools and platforms to solve real-world problems
    such as customer service queues, phone routing systems, voice agents, and agent-driven
    workflows
  - Act as a technical partner for retainer clients, owning solution delivery, refinement,
    and ongoing maintenance
  use_cases:
  - Customer service automation bots and phone routing systems
  - Voice agents for customer interaction automation
  - Multi-step AI agent workflows that autonomously call tools and APIs
  - Customer support queue automation with intelligent triage
  - Enterprise workflow automation using LLM-driven decision making
  - Agent-driven workflows for operational efficiency and cost reduction
