    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work building and deploying
      generative AI solutions with LLMs, including RAG
      implementations, prompt optimization, and full-stack AI
      application development. The engineer is directly
      responsible for automating content workflows using OpenAI
      models, embeddings, and chunking techniques, which is core
      AI/ML development work rather than support infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Drive automation and workflow improvements through innovative LLM solutions balancing
    speed, function, and robustness
  - Rapid prototyping of generative AI applications with full-stack development from
    proof-of-concept to front-end UI
  - Develop ETL/data pre-processing workflows to structure and manage clinical content
    for LLM pipelines
  - Collaborate with clinical editors and data scientists to implement RAG, optimize
    prompts, and evaluate AI strategies
  - Evaluate, measure, and continuously improve performance of generative AI solutions
  - Stay current with industry developments in generative AI technologies and best
    practices
  use_cases:
  - Automate search, filter, retrieval, and critical evaluation of medical literature
    to accelerate content production
  - Improve content creation efficiency with AI-powered copy editing assistance tools
  - Streamline evidence-based care guideline updates through automated literature
    review workflows
  - Enable clinical editors to create content more efficiently and accurately with
    AI-powered tools
