    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work building models, deploying
      LLMs, implementing RAG and prompt engineering at scale. The
      ML Engineer directly creates AI-powered features and models
      rather than just supporting infrastructure for other ML
      engineers.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and develop machine learning infrastructure, tooling, and models to help
    teams deliver world class experiences
  - Build internal products and platforms to enable teams to incorporate AI into their
    features and customer facing products
  - Build scalable, resilient services to support data integration, event processing,
    and platform extensions
  - Consult with teams to help them understand common patterns, anti-patterns, and
    tradeoffs of machine learning
  - Work with stakeholders to translate product goals into actionable engineering
    plans
  - Contribute to the continued evolution of product functionality that services large
    amounts of data and traffic
  - Coach and collaborate inside and outside the team, sharing expertise and encouraging
    best practices
  use_cases:
  - Building AI-powered applications that require access to large sets of data for
    product innovation
  - Developing natural language models and pipelines for B2B multi-tenant applications
  - Implementing real-time audio models for voice use cases including transcription,
    ASR pipelines, interruption detection, and speech synthesis
  - Handling data for hundreds of millions of people daily with TBs of data and 100M+
    to 10B+ records
  - Creating low latency natural language models and pipelines at scale for customer-facing
    products
