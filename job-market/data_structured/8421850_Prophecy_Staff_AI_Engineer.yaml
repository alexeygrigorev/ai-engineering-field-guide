      This role requires hands-on work with ML/LLMs including
      fine-tuning, building production agents with
      LangChain/LlamaIndex, RAG systems, and vector databases. The
      engineer will build multi-agent systems for ETL automation
      and code-gen, not just support infrastructure for AI work.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead fine-tuning and optimization of ML/LLM models using PyTorch and HuggingFace
  - Build and deploy production AI agents using LangChain, LlamaIndex, and CrewAI
    frameworks
  - Design and implement RAG systems with vector databases and prompt orchestration
  - Develop multi-agent systems for ETL automation and code generation applications
  - Architect and scale cloud infrastructure supporting 10k+ RPS backends on AWS/GCP
  - Enforce MLOps and DevOps practices including CI/CD, canaries, observability, and
    A/B prompt testing
  - Provide hands-on technical leadership through coding prototypes, mentoring staff,
    and solving complex problems
  use_cases:
  - AI-native data preparation and transformation using visual and document interfaces
  - Multi-agent systems for ETL automation and code generation loops
  - RAG-based systems for enterprise-scale data analysis and insight generation
  - Code generation and text-to-SQL applications for data workflows
  - Semantic extraction and knowledge graph applications using graph databases
