      This role involves hands-on work with generative AI models
      for image and video generation, including training and fine-
      tuning LoRA models. The engineer directly builds, optimizes,
      and deploys AI outputs, working on model architectures and
      experimentation rather than just supporting infrastructure.

  - Support rapid prototyping using text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-image,
    and video-to-video workflows
  - Produce high-quality, product-accurate AI imagery and video content for global
    clients
  - Train and fine-tune LoRA models using CGI datasets and photographic references
  - Optimize models and explore emerging image/video generation techniques and architectures
  - Collaborate with CGI artists to ensure outputs meet client-approved visual standards
    and translate experiments into reliable workflows
  - Conduct R&D to identify and evaluate new tools, methodologies, and models in the
    Gen AI landscape
  - Document findings and share expertise with the team for knowledge-sharing and
    continuous improvement
