      This role involves directly building, deploying, and scaling
      production LLM-powered systems with hands-on work on agentic
      architectures, RAG implementations, and agent evaluation
      frameworks. The position emphasizes designing and shipping
      AI-driven features including orchestration, tool use, and
      guardrails, which are core AI/ML engineering tasks rather
      than supporting infrastructure or data pipelines.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, implement, and ship AI-driven features and systems into production environments
  - Lead technical decision-making for AI architecture, data modeling, and system
    integration within domain
  - Partner with Product, Engineering, and stakeholders to translate business needs
    into scalable technical solutions
  - Identify and address reliability, scalability, performance, and observability
    challenges in AI systems
  - Implement and advocate for best practices for applied AI engineering including
    agent evaluation, interpretability, data layer design, and monitoring
  - Mentor and guide other engineers, raising the bar on AI engineering quality and
    decision-making
  - Provide input into technical strategy and roadmap discussions related to AI capabilities
    and platform evolution
  use_cases:
  - Agentic system design with orchestration, tool use, state/memory, and multi-step
    workflows
  - AI-powered customer engagement and conversational systems
  - Quality assurance through agent evaluation, regression testing, and online/offline
    metrics
  - Guardrails implementation for hallucination mitigation, grounding, HITL review,
    and safe degradation
  - Production operations management for cost/latency optimization, caching, rate-limits,
    and incident response
  - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with indexing strategies, freshness management,
    and data quality constraints
