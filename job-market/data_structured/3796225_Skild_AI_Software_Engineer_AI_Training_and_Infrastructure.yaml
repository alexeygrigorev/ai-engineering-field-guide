  title: Software Engineer, AI Training and Infrastructure
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building infrastructure, training
      pipelines, and tooling to support ML model training rather
      than directly building or training models. The engineer
      works collaboratively with researchers and ML engineers to
      enable their work through scalable systems, data
      preprocessing, and training orchestration, which aligns with
      ai-support classification.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and maintain robust, scalable, and distributed training pipelines and
    frameworks for large-scale AI models
  - Optimize training processes for performance and resource utilization, ensuring
    scalability and reliability
  - Collaborate with researchers and machine learning engineers to integrate state-of-the-art
    algorithms and techniques into training pipelines
  - Monitor and analyze training, identifying bottlenecks and proposing solutions
    to improve efficiency and performance
  - Ensure the robustness and reliability of the training infrastructure, including
    automated testing and continuous integration
  use_cases:
  - Training general purpose robotic intelligence models
  - Large-scale distributed AI model training
  - Data preprocessing and training orchestration for robotics applications
  - Scalable ML infrastructure for real-world robotics deployment
