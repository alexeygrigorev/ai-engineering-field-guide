    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This Forward Deployed Engineer role is hands-on with AI
      systems - deploying Unstructured AI solutions to enterprise
      customers, working with LLM-based enrichment models, and
      designing how data flows into AI systems. The role
      explicitly mentions becoming an expert in context
      engineering and using the Unstructured AI platform to build
      enterprise-grade AI products within customer environments.
  responsibilities:
  - Own end-to-end technical delivery of Unstructured AI deployments from prototype
    to stable production across enterprise environments
  - Build and scale full-stack systems that process and enrich large volumes of unstructured
    content including PDFs, contracts, and reports
  - Embed closely with customer and field teams to understand their metadata, governance,
    and security needs
  - Scope work, sequence delivery, and remove blockers to ensure fast iteration cycles
    between product, research, and deployment teams
  - Codify repeatable patterns from customer projects into reusable connectors, enrichment
    modules, or playbooks
  - Feed field insights back to Product and Research to identify opportunities to
    improve product experience
  use_cases:
  - Process and enrich large volumes of unstructured enterprise documents (PDFs, contracts,
    reports) at scale
  - Apply LLM-based enrichment models for classification, extraction, deduplication,
    and PII detection on enterprise data
  - Enable AI agents to reason over real-world enterprise data by designing how data,
    metadata, and domain knowledge flow into AI systems
  - Support AI-driven decision making at enterprise scale by transforming unstructured
    and structured data
  - Integrate Unstructured AI capabilities into customer's broader Collibra data governance
