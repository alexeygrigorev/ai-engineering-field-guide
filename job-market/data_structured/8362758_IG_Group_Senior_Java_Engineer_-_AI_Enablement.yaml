    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves building AI-powered development
      infrastructure including MCP servers, AI-assisted CI/CD
      pipelines, and agentic AI solutions. The engineer will
      implement AI directly in production workflows for code
      analysis, automated refactoring, test generation, and
      documentation - working hands-on with LLMs rather than just
      supporting others who do.
  responsibilities:
  - Modernise legacy services using AI tools for codebase analysis, dependency mapping,
    and API extraction
  - Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for service discovery, dependency
    mapping, and architecture compliance
  - Create AI-assisted CI/CD pipelines with automated code review, security scanning,
    and test generation
  - Build automation using Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and LLM APIs for development
    workflows
  - Demonstrate AI-first development practices through hands-on coding, refactoring,
    test creation, and documentation
  - Train teams on AI-enabled workflows and share learnings through shipped work and
    patterns
  use_cases:
  - Automated legacy service modernisation and migration using AI-assisted code analysis
  - AI-powered development tooling for increased engineering productivity and code
    quality
  - Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation for service discovery and architecture
    compliance
  - AI-driven CI/CD automation for code review, security scanning, and test generation
  - Agentic AI solutions for automated refactoring and documentation at scale
