    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves building AI-driven systems with LLM-based
      agents (Claude Code, GPT-based agents) and creating agentic
      workflows for autonomous data exploration. The engineer will
      directly implement and integrate AI coding agents into
      quantitative research pipelines, which constitutes hands-on
      work with AI models and agents.
  responsibilities:
  - Design AI-assisted research pipelines for data ingestion, feature engineering,
    alpha generation, and backtesting
  - Build agentic workflows that autonomously explore datasets and propose candidate
    signals
  - Rapidly prototype and evaluate systematic strategies with robust validation frameworks
  - Improve research efficiency by integrating AI coding agents into the quant workflow
  - Partner with researchers and PMs to transition validated alphas into production-ready
    implementations
  use_cases:
  - Alpha discovery for quantitative trading
  - Automated feature engineering and signal generation
  - Systematic trading strategy development and backtesting
  - AI-augmented quantitative research workflows
