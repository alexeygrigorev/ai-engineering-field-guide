      Hatch's AI-driven customer service platform. The engineer is
      not building, training, fine-tuning, or deploying AI agents

      and be delivered to customers.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and ship user-facing functionality spanning React web applications,
    backend APIs, and databases

    engineers to extend
  - Implement clean, maintainable React components and patterns that support usability,
    accessibility, and long-term velocity
  - Create intuitive schemas and query patterns that serve both product needs and
    developer productivity
  - Define conventions and make architectural decisions that balance speed, quality,
    and maintainability across the stack
  - Support engineers working in both backend and frontend areas, growing full-stack
    fluency and technical ownership
