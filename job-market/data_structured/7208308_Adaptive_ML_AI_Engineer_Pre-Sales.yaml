      This role requires hands-on work with AI systems including
      fine-tuning LLMs and building prototype pipelines using
      Adaptive Engine. Unlike typical pre-sales roles, this
      position involves directly working on model adaptation and
      deployment, not just demonstrating technology that others
      build.
  responsibilities:
  - Partner with sales to engage with prospects, uncovering business challenges and
    mapping them to Adaptive ML solutions
  - Design and deliver compelling technical demos tailored to specific customer use
    cases

    business outcomes
  - Build prototype pipelines and fine-tuned LLMs using Adaptive Engine to showcase
    production-ready solutions
  - Translate technical requirements into custom proposals, suggested architectures,
    and recommendations for customer deployments
  - Collaborate with research and product teams to influence roadmap priorities based
    on customer feedback
  - Represent Adaptive ML at conferences, webinars, and industry events with technical
    authority
  use_cases:
  - Specializing large language models for enterprise-specific business needs
  - Deploying adapted LLMs into production workflows with measurable impact
  - Building and evaluating optimized models for specific enterprise use cases
  - Enabling companies to leverage reinforcement learning for model improvement
