    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role is primarily a software engineering position
      building web/mobile apps and data pipelines that support the
      company's AI-powered computer vision platform. The
      description mentions working on client-facing applications
      and optimizing data pipelines rather than directly building,
      training, or fine-tuning ML models, which places it in the
      ai-support category.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and maintain new features across Visia's engineering services
    including client-facing web and mobile apps, computer vision pipeline, and IoT
    software
  - Maintain system reliability by monitoring, debugging, and resolving technical
    issues across multiple platforms
  - Collaborate with other engineers to write well-documented and maintainable code
    supporting the company's mission
  - Participate in cross-functional team meetings and contribute to Visia's overall
    product roadmap
  - Build customer-facing applications to facilitate alerting on prohibited items
    in material streams
  - Develop internal tooling for remote monitoring, configuration, and control of
    device fleet
  - Accelerate machine learning workflows by optimizing data pipelines and enabling
    seamless data transfer between edge devices and cloud
  use_cases:
  - Real-time detection and alerting of prohibited items in recycled material streams
  - Material audits and automated KPI tracking for recycling processors
  - Remote monitoring and control of IoT fleet in recycling facilities
  - Optimizing throughput in recycled materials processing (over 300% increase)
  - Creating transparent, traceable, and automated supply chain for waste materials
