      The role involves hands-on deployment and optimization of
      LLMs and Generative AI technologies, including integrating
      pre-trained models into production. Responsibilities include
      tuning model performance, latency, and managing AI/ML
      pipelines, which qualifies as working directly ON AI systems
      rather than just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop, deploy, and maintain robust AI and machine learning pipelines for internal
    and client-driven projects
  - Deploy, manage, and scale AI models, including pre-trained models (LLMs) and custom
    ML models, into production environments
  - Work with data scientists to implement model prototypes into scalable, production-ready
    AI systems
  - Optimize and tune model performance, latency, and cost-efficiency on cloud platforms
  - Integrate AI/ML solutions with major cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) and utilize
    containerization technologies (Docker, Kubernetes)
  - Apply standard MLOps practices, including continuous integration/continuous delivery
    (CI/CD), model versioning, monitoring, and maintenance systems
  - Collaborate with software engineering teams to ensure seamless integration of
    AI capabilities into applications and user workflows
  - Stay up to date with advancements in AI/ML technologies, Generative AI, and MLOps
    deployment strategies
  use_cases:
  - Deploying and scaling pre-trained Large Language Models and Generative AI technologies
    for client products
  - Integrating AI/ML capabilities into internal and client-facing applications
  - Building production-ready AI systems from data scientist prototypes
  - Optimizing model performance for cloud platforms to improve latency and cost-efficiency
