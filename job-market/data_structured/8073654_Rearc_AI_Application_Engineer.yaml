      Role involves hands-on work building GenAI solutions
      including LLMs, RAG architectures, fine-tuning, prompt
      engineering, and deploying models via Amazon Bedrock or
      Databricks AI. The engineer directly implements AI
      orchestration tools, compound AI systems, and integrates
      generative models with production services, not just
      supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Collaborate with colleagues to understand customer business objectives and technical
    challenges, designing and developing effective GenAI solutions
  - Build scalable, reliable, and maintainable Compound AI systems using tools like
    LangGraph and other modern frameworks
  - Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation architectures and integrate retrieval
    systems with generative models
  - Integrate Generative AI scripts with AWS, Databricks, and other cloud services
    to build scalable and secure AI solutions
  - Stay current with state of the art AI application development technologies and
    patterns
  - Share knowledge about AI engineering best practices through blog posts, articles,
    and internal talks to foster continuous learning
  use_cases:
  - Customer-specific GenAI solutions tailored to business objectives
  - Intelligent systems deployment in customer environments
  - Compound AI systems for enterprise applications
  - Knowledge base integration with LLMs for enhanced retrieval
  - Scalable and secure AI solutions built on cloud platforms
  - RAG-powered applications leveraging vector databases and similarity search
