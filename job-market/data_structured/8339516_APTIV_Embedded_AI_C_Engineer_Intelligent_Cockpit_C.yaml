  title: Embedded AI C++ Engineer – Intelligent Cockpit C++/Linux/Android
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves integrating ML models (CNNs, LLMs, VLMs)
      for embedded devices, accelerating runtime execution of CV
      and ML algorithms, and optimizing across CPU, GPU, DSP, NPU
      architectures. This is hands-on work deploying and
      optimizing AI models, not just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Write high-quality, well-tested, and efficient C++ code for AI/ML software stack
  - Integrate ML models including CNNs, LLMs, and vision-language models for Interior
    Sensing and Intelligent Cockpit applications on embedded devices
  - Accelerate runtime execution of computer vision and machine learning algorithms
    for specific hardware architectures
  - Develop efficient back-end applications for ML applications on Android and Linux
  - Integrate vehicle sensors and cameras with automotive operating systems like Android
    Automotive OS
  - Optimize algorithm scheduling across heterogeneous device cores including CPU,
    GPU, DSP, and NPU
  use_cases:
  - Interior Sensing for automotive applications
  - Intelligent Cockpit systems
  - Computer vision for vehicle interior monitoring
  - Vision-language model integration for automotive AI
  - Vehicle sensor and camera integration for AI applications
