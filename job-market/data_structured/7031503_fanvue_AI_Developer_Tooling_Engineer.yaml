    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role is about building infrastructure and tooling to
      enable OTHER engineers to use AI tools more effectively -
      not building or deploying AI models/products itself. The
      focus is on developer productivity, setting up AI coding
      workflows (Cursor, Claude Code, MCP servers), and creating
      the platforms/frameworks that allow the engineering
      organization to leverage AI, which falls squarely under ai-
      support.
  responsibilities:
  - Align the Fanvue codebase with modern AI coding tools such as Cursor and Claude
    Code
  - Define, standardize, and roll out AI-assisted development stack across IDEs, PR
    workflows, and CI
  - Build and operate MCP servers and AI-ready infrastructure for context-aware code
    generation
  - Enable parallelized development workflows with confident AI-generated code review
    and shipping
  - Establish best practices for AI-assisted coding, reviews, and refactoring across
    the team
  - Track and report measurable improvements in developer productivity including PR
    cycle time and code quality
  - Evaluate emerging AI developer tools and vendors with success criteria and kill
    switches
  use_cases:
  - Accelerating developer velocity and feature delivery through AI-assisted coding
    workflows
  - Enabling parallelized development with AI-generated code review and automated
    PR processes
  - Building context-aware code generation systems integrated across IDEs and CI pipelines
  - Establishing safe and consistent AI deployment practices across the engineering
    organization
  - Measuring and improving developer productivity metrics like PR cycle time and
    throughput
