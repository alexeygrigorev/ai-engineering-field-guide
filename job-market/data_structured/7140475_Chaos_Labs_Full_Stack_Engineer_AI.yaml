position:
  title: Full Stack Engineer (AI)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on development of a financial AI
      agent with explicit requirements for LLM frameworks
      (LangChain), vector databases, RAG pipelines, and agent
      orchestration (MCP). The engineer will integrate and
      productionize agent logic, build systems for the AI agent,
      and work directly with agent workflows, which qualifies as
      working directly ON AI systems rather than just supporting
      them.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build full-stack systems for the AI financial agent
  - Develop scalable APIs and backend services to support agent workflows
  - Build high-performance, user-facing interfaces to visualize agent reasoning and
    surface insights, as well as enable real-time interaction
  - Collaborate with AI researchers to integrate and productionize agent logic
  - Connect and manage data pipelines from financial sources
  - Implement testing, monitoring, and performance best practices
  - Stay up to date with LLM frameworks, full-stack tools, and financial trends
  use_cases:
  - Financial AI agent for risk management and capital efficiency analysis
  - On-chain economic security system for crypto protocols
  - Real-time agent reasoning visualization and insights for DeFi protocols
  - Automated analysis of protocol mechanics and scenario implications using EVM simulations
  - Integration of AI agents with blockchain protocols and DeFi systems
