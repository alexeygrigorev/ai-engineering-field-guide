  title: Full Stack Software Engineer (AI, ML, and Data Science)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a full-stack software engineer role that builds web
      applications, APIs, and services to integrate and
      operationalize AI/ML models, but does not involve building,
      training, or fine-tuning the models themselves. The engineer
      implements RAG pipelines and vector databases to make AI
      models accessible through user-facing tools, which is
      supporting AI work rather than doing AI work directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and develop full-stack web applications, Data APIs, and analytics dashboards
    that integrate AI/ML models
  - Build and maintain backend services and APIs using Python (FastAPI, Django) and
    Node.js, integrating with Databricks, AWS SageMaker, or similar platforms
  - Develop intuitive, responsive front-end interfaces using React.js, Next.js, JavaScript,
    and CSS frameworks
  - Deploy scalable, cloud-native applications leveraging AWS, GCP, or Azure infrastructure
  - Work with AI/ML engineers to implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines,
    vector databases, and AI model endpoints
  - Implement secure authentication, data access, and API management for consumer
    and internal applications
  - Build CI/CD pipelines, automate testing, and optimize system performance for production
    workloads
  - Partner with product and design teams to deliver user-centric AI application experiences
  use_cases:
  - Help consumers make informed choices through intelligent, data-driven experiences
  - Empower employees with next-generation AI tools
  - Address AI harms in the digital marketplace
  - Make AI models accessible through user-facing tools and applications
  - Provide data-driven product ratings and consumer insights
