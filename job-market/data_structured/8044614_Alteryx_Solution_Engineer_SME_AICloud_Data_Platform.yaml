      Data Platform that is primarily sales-facing and GTM-

  - Translate strategic vision into clear execution plans with defined timelines and
    measurable outcomes
  - Build alignment across diverse teams, driving accountability while managing dependencies
    and risks
  - Deliver high-quality recommendations and executive-ready presentations that influence
    decision-making
  - Lead the GTM organization in creation, planning, and execution of GTM messaging
    and initiatives

    insights
