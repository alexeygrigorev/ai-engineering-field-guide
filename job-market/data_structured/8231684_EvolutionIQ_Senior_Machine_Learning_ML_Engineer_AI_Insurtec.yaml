    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves building ML/LLM-driven features,
      extracting information from medical documents using language
      models, and deploying machine learning models for time
      series forecasting and NLP understanding. The engineer works
      directly on building, training, and deploying models, not
      just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Build ML/LLM-driven features for claim guidance product including information
    extraction from medical documents and human-in-the-loop workflows
  - Perform exploratory data analysis to scope ML opportunities and establish model
    design, training, and evaluation strategies
  - Build scalable machine learning models for claim time series forecasting and NLP
    text understanding
  - Translate client business problems into ML problems and implement features to
    improve model performance
  - Deploy and maintain model-serving pipelines in production with daily production-quality
    code reviews
  - Make sense of large-scale structured and unstructured datasets for business problems
  use_cases:
  - Insurance claim guidance and automated recommendations for claims handling teams
  - Information extraction from complex medical documents using ML/LLM
  - Claim time series forecasting for predicting claim outcomes and timelines
  - NLP-based understanding of insurance claim documentation and unstructured text
  - Human-in-the-loop workflows combining AI recommendations with human review
  - Making insurance claims handling more accurate, fair, and efficient
