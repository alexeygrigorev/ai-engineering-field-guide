      The job description mentions both traditional ML frameworks
      (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn) and AI/ML in general
      terms but does not specify LLMs, RAG, agents, or GenAI
      tools. Without clear indication of whether the role focuses
      on modern generative AI or traditional machine learning, the
      classification remains uncertain.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and implement machine learning models and algorithms to solve
    complex business problems
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to identify and prioritize AI/ML opportunities
  - Preprocess and clean large datasets, perform feature engineering, and conduct
    exploratory data analysis
  - Develop and maintain scalable ML pipelines for model training, evaluation, and
    deployment
  - Optimize existing ML models for improved performance and efficiency
  - Contribute to the development of AI/ML strategies and roadmaps
  - Mentor junior team members and share knowledge through documentation and presentations
  use_cases:
  - Solve complex business problems through ML solutions
  - Develop AI/ML solutions for job portal operations
  - Build predictive models for job matching and recommendations
  - Implement NLP for job search and matching
  - Apply computer vision for resume or image processing
  - Create scalable ML pipelines for production deployment
