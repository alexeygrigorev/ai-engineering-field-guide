    data flows, and robust data validation frameworks
  - Design and implement reliable, scalable, and secure data pipelines that serve
    analytical and product use cases
  - Provide technical leadership and mentorship to other data engineers and cross-functional
    collaborators
  - Own the architecture and evolution of the data platform, ensuring performance,
    scalability, and agility
  - Implement data governance, quality, and observability best practices to ensure
    trustworthy insights
  - Optimize cloud data infrastructure for cost, performance, and maintainability
  - Collaborate with product managers, engineers, and customer stakeholders to translate
    needs into engineering solutions
  use_cases:
  - AI/ML predictions and forecasts for decision intelligence products
  - Feature engineering pipelines supporting machine learning models
  - Data validation frameworks ensuring model input/output quality
  - Analytical data products delivering business insights
  - Customer-facing data products driving decision intelligence
