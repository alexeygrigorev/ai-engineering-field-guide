    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work building autonomous agents,
      co-pilots, and RAG architectures using LangChain,
      LlamaIndex, AutoGen, and CrewAI. The engineer will implement
      MCP/A2A protocols and work directly with LLMs and
      intelligent agent architectures, which is core AI
      development rather than support work.
  responsibilities:
  - Define, design, and supervise the technical architecture of solutions based on
    intelligent agents and LLMs
  - Integrate frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, CrewAI, or equivalent
    into agent architectures
  - Implement MCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) architectures
    for multi-agent coordination
  - Enable autonomous flows within business environments through agent coordination
  - Collaborate with MLOps team on continuous agent updating and deployment
  - Manage memory, context, and long-term planning in execution environments
  - Work with product, UX, data, and backend teams to map business needs to intelligent
    agent architectures
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous agents and co-pilots for business operations
  - Multi-agent coordination systems using MCP and A2A protocols
  - RAG-based solutions with vector stores for information retrieval
  - AI-powered solutions for accounting, finance, payroll, billing, or ERP domains
  - Intelligent agent architectures that integrate with existing business systems
