      This is a hands-on research engineering role building large-
      scale foundation models for biology. The role involves
      pretraining, fine-tuning, and implementing models using
      PyTorch, which directly contributes to AI system development
      rather than supporting it.
  responsibilities:
  - Execute the research roadmap including large-scale pretraining of foundation models
  - Fine-tune foundation models for impactful applications in biology
  - Drive research for cutting-edge foundation model efforts and lead projects
  - Implement software for research initiatives and applied AI workflows
  - Collaborate with researchers and engineers on interdisciplinary projects
  - Engage the scientific community through publications and open-source releases
  use_cases:
  - Understanding and programming life at scale using AI
  - Studying cellular operations and systems to understand disease mechanisms
  - Building next-generation biology models using large-scale compute infrastructure
  - Applying AI models to solve applied problems in biological research
  - Accelerating scientific discoveries to help cure or prevent disease
  - Developing open science tools and data for the broader research community
