    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is an AI-first role focused on building LLM-based
      features end-to-end, including prompt engineering, RAG
      systems, evaluation frameworks, and optimization of
      embeddings and vector stores. The engineer will ship multi-
      provider LLM solutions to production and work directly with
      large-context LLM systems using advanced techniques.
  responsibilities:
  - Own the development and application of LLM-based features end-to-end
  - Build and maintain evaluation frameworks for prompt iteration and semantic retrieval
  - Optimize embeddings and vector stores for performance and scalability
  - Interact with users to understand their problems and design solutions
  - Stay up-to-date with the latest trends in LLMs and applied AI practices
  - Collaborate with a cross-functional team to create cutting-edge products
  use_cases:
  - Multi-provider LLM-based solutions for production use
  - Large-context LLM systems with RAG, knowledge graphs, and hybrid search
  - Prompt management, logging/tracing, and evaluation systems
  - Semantic retrieval and vector search optimization
  - User-centric product features powered by language models
