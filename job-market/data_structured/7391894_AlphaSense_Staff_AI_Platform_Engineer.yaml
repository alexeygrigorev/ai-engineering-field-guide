      This role is a platform engineering position focused on
      building infrastructure, reliability, and engineering
      excellence for AI systems. The engineer is not building,
      training, or fine-tuning models directly, but rather
      architecting distributed systems, establishing
      observability, and creating platforms that enable other
      engineers to ship AI applications reliably.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement distributed systems that power AI agents processing thousands
    of requests per hour, ensuring reliability, performance, and cost-efficiency
  - Establish comprehensive testing strategies, observability systems, and CI/CD pipelines
    to catch issues before customers do
  - Mentor a team of engineers, sharing experience in building production systems
    with high reliability
  - Own the technical roadmap for the AI platform and make architectural decisions
    shaping future systems
  - Collaborate with ML engineers and researchers to productionize cutting-edge AI
    capabilities while maintaining system stability
  use_cases:
  - AI agents processing market intelligence requests at scale
  - Enterprise market intelligence search powered by AI
  - RAG-based search and retrieval from research documents, company filings, and expert
    calls
  - Multi-model AI systems delivering insights from thousands of content sets
  - Agentic systems that power decision-making for S&P 500 companies
