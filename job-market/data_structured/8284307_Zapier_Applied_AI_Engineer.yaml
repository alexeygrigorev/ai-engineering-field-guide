      The role involves hands-on work building with LLMs in
      production, including agent architectures, RAG systems,
      evaluation frameworks, and function calling. The engineer is
      responsible for integrating LLMs into software products and
      owning the full lifecycle of LLM architecture development,
      not just enabling work for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Integrate LLMs into software products at Zapier, setting up necessary infrastructure
    for performance, scalability, and reliability
  - Build tooling and infrastructure that enables teams to iterate on AI products
    faster without sacrificing safety or reliability
  - Monitor performance and health of AI systems, proactively detecting and addressing
    system failures and performance degradation
  - Implement data-driven feedback loops that capture user data, synthesize use cases,
    and test strategies with LLMs to enhance performance
  - Improve cost observability across teams and work to optimize spend for AI products
  - Collaborate with Data and cross-functional teams to refine and deploy LLM-based
    features
  use_cases:
  - Building user-facing features leveraging agent architectures with LLMs
  - Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for improved model accuracy
    and speed
  - Deploying evaluation frameworks for LLMs to assess performance, reliability, and
    bias
  - Optimizing knowledge retrieval with semantic search and vector databases
  - Creating shared libraries, evaluation systems, and orchestration patterns for
    AI development
  - Enhancing automation workflows with AI-powered capabilities
