    reasoning: |-
      Role involves building and scaling systems for LLMs, RAG,
      and agents. Hands-on work with prompt engineering, knowledge
      retrieval pipelines, and AI model evaluation - directly
      working ON GenAI systems rather than just supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and develop reusable, scalable platform services that expose GenAI models,
    knowledge retrieval pipelines, and agent workflows to application teams
  - Build and maintain knowledge retrieval systems including embedding generation,
    chunking, and database management strategies
  - Set up frameworks for monitoring and evaluating AI output quality including relevance,
    accuracy, safety, drift, and cost
  - Create prompt templates, system prompts, and guidelines for context engineering
    and platform users
  - Work with cross-functional teams to build flagship AI projects and develop best
    practices for AI at Octopus
  - Design and build backend applications and services that connect AI models into
    wider applications and business logic
  use_cases:
  - Generate tens of thousands of high-quality customer emails combining energy industry
    knowledge with customer-specific data
  - Enterprise knowledge retrieval and search using RAG systems
  - AI-powered customer support and communication systems
  - Agent-based workflows for energy specialist assistance
  - Platform services enabling multiple teams to deploy GenAI applications
