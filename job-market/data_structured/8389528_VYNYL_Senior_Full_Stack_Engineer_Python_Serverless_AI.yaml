  title: Senior Full Stack Engineer (Python, Serverless, AI Fluency)

    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      The role is a Senior Full Stack Engineer focused on building
      serverless backend services using Python and AWS. While it
      requires fluency with AI/ML development tools (GitHub
      Copilot, Claude Code, agentic coding tools, LLMs) for
      software development productivity, these are used as aids to
      write and review code rather than building, deploying, or
      fine-tuning AI/ML models themselves. The engineer works ON
      applications that may leverage AI services, but the primary
      responsibility is software engineering and infrastructure
      development, not AI/ML model development.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the design and implementation of highly scalable, cost-efficient serverless
    backend services using Python and AWS services including Lambda, API Gateway,
    DynamoDB, SQS, and EventBridge
  - Architect and build event-sourced systems and event-driven pipelines, ensuring
    reliable message processing, idempotency, and eventual consistency across distributed
    services
  - Collaborate with product managers and designers to translate requirements into
    technical designs and shippable code
  - Implement best practices for security, logging, monitoring, and infrastructure-as-code
    using Terraform or CloudFormation
  - Perform rigorous code reviews, mentor junior and mid-level engineers, and drive
    technical excellence across the team
  - Actively research, propose, and integrate new technologies and patterns, with
    a focus on optimizing development velocity and system performance
  - Clearly articulate a professional point of view on how to effectively, securely,
    and ethically integrate AI tools into the software development lifecycle
  use_cases:
  - Detecting diseases through AI-enabled diagnostic tools
  - Identifying children who need special educational support
  - Applying AI to support complex legal settlements
  - Helping people access mental health services
  - System modernization and new product development for regulated industries including
    healthcare, financial services, government, and education
