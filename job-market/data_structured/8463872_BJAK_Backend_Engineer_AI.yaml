    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role focuses on building and operating backend systems
      that power AI-powered features, specifically designing
      inference pipelines and orchestration layers around LLMs and
      embeddings. The engineer works directly with models,
      optimizing inference latency and throughput, and implements
      AI systems for production use.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and operate backend systems that serve AI-powered features in production
  - Design inference pipelines, orchestration layers, and service boundaries around
    models
  - Own production concerns including monitoring, logging, alerting, and incident
    response
  - Optimize latency and throughput across inference, caching, batching, and streaming
  use_cases:
  - Proactive AI system that carries work forward across conversations, tools, and
    time
  - AI-powered features in production environments
  - LLM-based inference and orchestration systems
  - Multimodal AI inference pipelines
  - High-throughput, low-latency AI services
