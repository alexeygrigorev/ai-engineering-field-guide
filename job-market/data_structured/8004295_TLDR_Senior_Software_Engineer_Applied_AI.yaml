      This role involves building production AI agents, designing
      Claude Skills, and implementing autonomous systems that
      handle real business workflows. The engineer will directly
      work on AI components including prompt engineering, context
      management, and LLM APIs, rather than just supporting

    Google Drive, Slack, and Sponsy
  - Design clean abstractions enabling non-technical users to compose AI primitives
    into workflows without writing code
  - Ship autonomous AI agents using workflow automation platforms like n8n to handle
    sales, marketing, and operations tasks
  - Establish and maintain AI development infrastructure including tooling, templates,
    patterns, and documentation
  - Design composable interfaces between AI components where outputs from one tool
    become inputs to another
  - Create a production-ready Skills Library covering CRM analysis, proposal generation,
    knowledge base search, and competitive research
  use_cases:
  - CRM analysis and proposal generation for sales workflows
  - Knowledge base search and competitive research automation
  - Lead enrichment and content research through autonomous agents
  - Data hygiene and reporting without human intervention
  - Internal tooling for non-technical teammates to create AI workflows
  - Marketing and operations task automation using autonomous agents
