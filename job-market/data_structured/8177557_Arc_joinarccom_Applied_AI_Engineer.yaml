      This role is directly building AI-powered financial products
      using Generative AI techniques including agentic workflows,
      RAG systems, and state-of-the-art model integrations. The
      role involves hands-on work with LLMs, model optimization,
      and building production-grade AI systems, which clearly
      qualifies as working ON AI rather than supporting it.

    AI-powered financial products
  - Build evaluation frameworks, model-improvement infrastructure, and production-grade
    AI systems
  - Rapidly prototype 0→1 and MVP experiences to unlock new value for Arc customers
  - Ship projects frequently and consistently, with strong bias to action
  - Architect and implement Generative AI applications using agentic workflows, RAG
    systems, and state-of-the-art model leveraging techniques
  - Optimize for inference performance, token efficiency, latency, and cost
  - Contribute to platform-level systems in Python and Typescript
  use_cases:
  - Business cash management through AI-powered platform
  - Treasury management with AI automation
  - Debt marketplace powered by AI
  - Financial data analysis and action through unified platform
  - AI-driven insights for financial decision-making
