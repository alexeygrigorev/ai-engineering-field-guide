      The role is titled "AI First Software Engineer" but the
      actual responsibilities focus on general software
      engineering - building microservices, REST APIs, and web
      applications using Java, Spring Boot, Docker, and
      Kubernetes. The AI-related requirements are limited to using
      AI development tools (GitHub CoPilot, Cursor) and
      "implementing AI thinking," which means applying AI concepts
      to improve efficiency rather than building or deploying
      AI/ML models directly.

  - Mentor and guide junior team members to foster their development
  - Cultivate substantial relationships with clients to understand their needs
  - Analyze project requirements and deliver quality results
  - Work with cross-functional teams to confirm project alignment
  - Maintain awareness of industry trends to drive continuous improvement

  - Software solutions for digital transformation and business performance enhancement
  - Microservices-based applications with REST APIs and event-driven architecture
  - Client-facing software projects across various industries
  - Enterprise applications leveraging AI development tools for efficiency
