  title: Software Engineer — AI-Enabled Product Autonomy
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is building an AI-first product development loop
      with agentic development environments, orchestrating
      multiple AI agents for autonomous software development. The
      engineer will directly build and optimize the infrastructure
      for AI agents, including LLM gateways handling 10K-100K
      requests/second and coding sandboxes for generated code
      execution. This is hands-on work implementing AI/ML systems,
      not supporting other AI practitioners.
  responsibilities:
  - Build an AI-enabled product development loop achieving product autonomy through
    AI-first workflows
  - Create a desktop app alternative to IDEs as an agentic development environment
    with multiple AI agents
  - Scale the language model gateway to handle 10K-100K requests per second with low
    latency and high reliability
  - Build and optimize coding sandboxes for AI agents enabling safe, isolated code
    execution
  - Orchestrate multiple stateful AI agents enriched with PostHog product data
  - Develop the end-to-end AI product development pipeline from analysis to auto-merge
    features
  use_cases:
  - Agentic development environment that replaces human-driven product development
    cycles with AI-first workflows
  - Multiple autonomous AI agents that perform product analysis, coding, and review
    tasks
  - Desktop app alternative to traditional IDEs for AI-powered software development
  - Auto-merged features generated by AI agents with robustness and scalability
  - AI-powered analyst using PostHog product data to answer product questions and
    write SQL queries
  - Isolated execution environment for AI-generated code ensuring safety and reliability
