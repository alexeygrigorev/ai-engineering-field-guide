  name: Striim
  stage: Pre-IPO
  focus: Real-time data integration and streaming platform
position:
  title: Software Engineer II - Platform/AI
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a platform engineering role building infrastructure
      for AI capabilities rather than directly working with AI
      models. The focus is on distributed systems, data streaming,
      microservices, and cloud infrastructure that enables AI
      features (automation, intelligent data enrichment,
      contextual insights) to be embedded across the platform.
      While exposure to agentic AI frameworks and LLM-based
      automation is mentioned as a plus, the core work is on
      platform components and orchestration frameworks that
      support AI, not building or training models directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, implement, and maintain core components of Striim's AI/Platform infrastructure
    for scalable, real-time data processing
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to embed AI capabilities across the platform
  - Develop and optimize microservices for performance, reliability, and cost efficiency
    in multi-cloud environments
  - Contribute to platform observability, automation, and intelligent orchestration
    frameworks
  - Write clean, efficient, and testable code following modern best practices including
    CI/CD
  - Participate in technical design discussions and influence architectural decisions
  - Troubleshoot and resolve production issues quickly and effectively
  use_cases:
  - Real-time data integration and streaming across clouds, data, and applications
  - AI-driven automation for data integration workflows
  - Intelligent data enrichment with contextual insights in real time
  - Event monitoring across any environment for enterprise companies
  - Real-time analytics to enable digital transformation applications
