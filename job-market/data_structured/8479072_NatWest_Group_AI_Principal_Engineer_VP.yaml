      This role requires hands-on experience building and
      optimizing pipelines for LLMs, implementing RAG, embedding
      pipelines, LLM orchestration, and model fine-tuning. The
      role involves direct work with AI/ML systems including model
      deployment, evaluation, and integration with
      OpenAI/Anthropic models, which goes beyond AI-support
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Define and develop architecture models and roadmaps for application and software
    components to meet business and technical requirements
  - Build and optimize pipelines for LLMs, traditional ML models, and data processing
    using OSS frameworks or AWS/GCP ecosystems
  - Implement supervised and unsupervised learning, time-series forecasting, RAG,
    embedding pipelines, LLM orchestration, and prompt engineering
  - Define and enforce standards for MLOps, CI/CD, experiment tracking, model deployment,
    observability, security, and performance tuning
  - Evaluate and integrate capabilities across OpenAI/Anthropic models, fine-tuning,
    GPU compute, AutoML, and feature stores
  - Collaborate with feature teams to produce high-quality software rapidly that adds
    business value
  - Design and engineer complex software, scripts, and tools to enable delivery of
    bank platforms, applications, and services
  use_cases:
  - Time-series forecasting for financial predictions
  - RAG-based systems for knowledge retrieval and question answering
  - LLM-powered applications for customer service and banking operations
  - Supervised and unsupervised learning for fraud detection and risk assessment
  - Data processing pipelines for financial data transformation and analysis
