      This is an ML Platform engineering role focused on building
      infrastructure, tools, and pipelines to enable ML teams to
      deploy and serve models. The engineer works NEAR AI by
      building deployment pipelines, CI/CD workflows, and serving
      infrastructure, but does not directly build, train, or fine-
      tune models themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and maintain scalable systems and infrastructure for deploying and serving
    ML models
  - Design low-latency, fault-tolerant model inference systems using Amazon SageMaker
  - Implement safe deployment strategies like blue/green deployments and rollbacks
  - Create and manage CI/CD pipelines for ML workflows
  - Monitor model performance and system health using AWS observability tools
  - Develop internal tools and APIs to help ML teams deploy and monitor models easily
  - Collaborate with ML engineers, data scientists, and DevOps to productionize new
    models
  use_cases:
  - Real-time identity verification for fraud prevention
  - Model inference systems serving identity trust predictions
  - Automated ML model deployment pipelines for production systems
  - Monitoring and observability for deployed ML models
  - Feature serving and caching for ML workloads
