    type: ml-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role focuses on traditional computer vision and deep
      learning techniques like ViT, RCNN, and action recognition
      on image sequences. While it mentions generative AI as a
      preference, the core requirements are conventional computer
      vision algorithms and models for robotic/autonomous systems,
      not LLMs, RAG, or agentic AI.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop, test, debug, deploy, and maintain computer vision algorithms and hardware
    for different environments
  - Develop automated vision algorithms for robots and autonomous hardware systems
  - Gather and optimize analytics from computer vision algorithms to improve performance
  - Research and apply software, computer vision, and machine learning techniques
    for challenges bridging virtual and real worlds
  use_cases:
  - Action recognition on sequences of images for multi-dimensional video content
  - Autonomous robot navigation and hardware interaction
  - 3D reconstruction of visual content
  - Interactive video experiences that break the fourth wall
