    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is a Forward Deployed AI Engineer who directly builds
      and deploys GenAI systems to customers, including LLM
      workflows, RAG architectures, agentic orchestration, and
      Graph RAG. The role involves hands-on model deployment,
      fine-tuning, evaluation, and LLMOps, not just supporting AI
      infrastructure. While customer-facing, the engineer actively
      constructs and optimizes AI solutions rather than providing
      general support for an AI company.
  responsibilities:
  - Own end-to-end GenAI strategy from discovery and problem decomposition to production
    deployment and adoption
  - Define solution architectures across RAG, agentic AI, knowledge bases, and multi-turn
    conversational systems
  - Design and deploy large-scale LLM workflows, RAG systems, Graph RAG, and autonomous/agentic
    systems
  - Establish robust evaluation frameworks and drive iterative improvement of AI systems
  - Build conversational chatbots and search strategies using hybrid retrieval and
    query rewriting
  - Implement conversation memory systems using short-term context buffers and long-term
    vector/graph stores
  - Develop and register AI Fabric components with traceability, observability, and
    reusability
  - Build LLMOps observability including tracing, prompt management, evaluation pipelines,
    and safety guardrails
  use_cases:
  - Healthcare conversational AI systems with multi-turn memory
  - Enterprise knowledge base search and retrieval using RAG and Graph RAG
  - Medical document understanding and information extraction
  - Healthcare decision support systems with agentic AI orchestration
  - Clinical workflow automation using knowledge graphs and ontologies
  - AI-powered medical technology solutions with regulatory compliance
