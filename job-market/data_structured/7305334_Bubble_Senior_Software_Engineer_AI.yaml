  name: Bubble
  stage: Series A
  focus: AI-powered no-code visual development platform
position:
  title: Senior Software Engineer, AI
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is an ai-first role involving hands-on work with LLMs,
      RAG pipelines, and agentic workflows. The engineer will
      build LLM-driven product features, design agent workflows,
      and develop private models trained on proprietary datasets.
      The role directly involves implementing and optimizing AI
      systems rather than just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Drive the design and implementation of AI-powered products and features that integrate
    with the Bubble Editor, elevating and evolving how users build with AI
  - Iterate across the stack to build intuitive and powerful UX for AI features, improve
    the latency and accuracy of agent and RAG pipelines, and enhance how the system
    understands and manipulates Bubble's proprietary application representation
  - Build frameworks for evaluating agent performance to power both product strategy
    and engineering innovation
  - Translate ambiguous AI challenges into actionable engineering plans, leveraging
    emergent technologies and experimentation
  - Shape the direction of AI initiatives in partnership with product, engineering,
    and design teams to advance the platform's capabilities
  use_cases:
  - AI-assisted full-stack development allowing users to describe applications in
    natural language and have AI generate, modify, and enhance their apps
  - Enable users to take ideas from prompt to fully-functional, scalable reality across
    web, iOS, and Android without writing code
  - LLM-driven application generation and modification through agentic workflows
  - Understanding and manipulating Bubble's proprietary application representation
