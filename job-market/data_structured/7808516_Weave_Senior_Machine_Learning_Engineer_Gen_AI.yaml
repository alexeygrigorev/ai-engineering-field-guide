      The role involves building models with LLMs, implementing
      RAG, prompt engineering, and fine-tuning models. This is
      hands-on work directly with AI models and deployment to
      production, not just infrastructure or platform support.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and develop machine learning infrastructure, tooling, and models to help
    teams deliver world class experiences
  - Build internal products and platforms to enable teams to incorporate AI into their
    features and customer facing products
  - Build scalable, resilient services to support data integration, event processing,
    and platform extensions
  - Consult with teams to help them understand common patterns, anti-patterns, and
    tradeoffs of machine learning
  - Build models for new products with emerging technologies at scale to enable AI-powered
    applications
  - Design and architect systems for distributed data sets and services handling hundreds
    of millions of people daily
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered applications that require access to large sets of data
  - Natural language models with embeddings and inference at scale
  - Real-time audio models and voice use cases including transcription, ASR pipelines,
    and speech synthesis
  - Multi-modal models for various customer-facing products
  - ML-driven B2B multi-tenant applications in production environments
  - Handling sensitive data such as PHI (HIPAA) and PII data
