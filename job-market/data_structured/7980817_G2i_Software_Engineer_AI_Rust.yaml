  title: Software Engineer, AI (Rust)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on providing human feedback (ranking,
      editing, reviewing code) for RLHF pipelines to train LLMs,
      rather than building, deploying, or fine-tuning models
      directly. The work involves code review and refactoring to
      generate training data/signals for others to use in model
      training, which is enabling work for AI systems rather than
      hands-on AI development.
  responsibilities:
  - Compare and rank multiple code snippets, explaining which is best and why
  - Repair and refactor AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and style
  - Inject feedback including ratings, edits, and test results into the RLHF pipeline
  - Provide detailed explanations of code quality to help the model learn
  - Identify logic errors, performance traps, and security issues in code
  - Maintain smooth operation of the RLHF feedback pipeline
  use_cases:
  - Training large language models to write production-grade code
  - Generating expert code comparisons and rankings for model learning
  - Creating reward signals through human code feedback for reinforcement learning
  - Improving AI code generation through human-in-the-loop refinement
  - Teaching LLMs to propose, critique, and improve code like expert engineers
