      This is a data engineering role focused on building data
      pipelines, infrastructure, and platforms to enable AI/ML
      workloads for molecular design. The role involves preparing,
      integrating, and managing data for downstream modeling but
      does not involve building, training, fine-tuning, or
      deploying AI/ML models directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Support data integration efforts by collaborating with scientists, bioinformaticians,
    and AI engineers to ensure data is accessible and well-structured for downstream
    modeling
  - Build and maintain data pipelines to ingest, transform, and store structured and
    unstructured biological data from wet lab experiments, public databases, and internal
    platforms
  - Implement data quality checks and validation routines to ensure reliability and
    reproducibility of datasets used in molecular design workflows
  - Contribute to infrastructure development by assisting in the setup and optimization
    of cloud-based data platforms and tools for scalable storage and compute
  - Document workflows and processes to support reproducibility, collaboration, and
    knowledge sharing across teams
  use_cases:
  - AI-driven molecular design for life sciences applications
  - Processing and analysis of biological data including genomic sequences, protein
    structures, and assay results
  - Wet lab experiment data integration for molecular design workflows
  - Scientific research and development in diagnostics, life sciences, and biotechnology
  - Bioinformatics data management and analysis for molecular design
