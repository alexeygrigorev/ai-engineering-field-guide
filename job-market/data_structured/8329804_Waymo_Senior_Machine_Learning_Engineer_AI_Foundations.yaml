  title: Senior Machine Learning Engineer, AI Foundations
  ai_type:
    type: ml-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves conducting applied foundation model
      research, training and evaluating large deep learning
      models, and working with frameworks like JAX, TensorFlow,
      and PyTorch. The focus is on traditional ML areas like
      reinforcement learning, learning from demonstration,
      Bayesian inference, and hierarchical learning, rather than
      building LLM-powered applications or agents, which aligns
      with ml-first classification.
  responsibilities:
  - Conduct applied foundation model research and development
  - Design compelling experiments by training and evaluating large deep learning models
  - Write high quality code, unit tests, and documentation
  - Collaborate with other teams to deploy models to production
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous driving safety and operation across cities and driving conditions
  - Reinforcement learning for autonomous driving decision making
  - Learning from demonstration to train autonomous driving models
  - Generative modeling for autonomous driving scenarios
  - Hierarchical learning for complex driving tasks
  - Robust evaluation of autonomous driving systems
