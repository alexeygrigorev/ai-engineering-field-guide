    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      Role is deeply hands-on with architecting and building LLM-
      based systems, agentic workflows, RAG pipelines, and model
      fine-tuning. While it includes infrastructure work, the core
      focus is on designing and implementing AI/ML models and
      systems, not just supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect enterprise-grade AI systems using LLMs, multimodal models, vector databases,
    knowledge graphs, and agentic orchestration frameworks
  - Design end-to-end ML pipelines from data ingestion through model training, evaluation,
    deployment, and feedback loops
  - Define engineering standards for MLOps, LLMOps, data quality, model observability,
    guardrails, and prompt security
  - Guide teams in building prototypes, PoCs, and production systems using modern
    AI stacks including transformer and diffusion models
  - Architect secure, high-throughput data platforms for AI/BI use cases based on
    lakehouse and streaming patterns
  - Advise CIO/CTO/CDO teams on AI system design, architecture modernization, and
    model lifecycle governance
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise-scale AI systems with retrieval-augmented generation and autonomous
    agent workflows
  - Multimodal AI applications combining text, vision, and speech processing
  - Real-time event-driven AI systems with continuous learning loops
  - Large-scale distributed model training and inference optimization
  - Data platform modernization for AI and business intelligence use cases
  - Intelligent automation systems with multi-agent architectures
