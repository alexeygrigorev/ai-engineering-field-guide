  title: AI Engineer II (Remote)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is an AI-first role because the engineer will build AI-
      powered platforms and systems from scratch, implement RAG
      and LLM application patterns, develop agentic systems, and
      deploy AI solutions directly into customer-facing products
      and internal tools. The role requires hands-on experience
      with transformer architectures, fine-tuning strategies,
      embeddings, vector databases, and intelligent automation -
      all core AI/ML engineering activities.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the design, development, and ownership of AI-powered internal platforms and
    systems built from the ground up
  - Own end-to-end delivery of complex projects from problem discovery through production
    rollout and iteration
  - Design and implement AI-driven features, intelligent automation, and orchestration
    systems
  - Embed AI capabilities into customer-facing products, internal tools, and operational
    workflows
  - Build full-stack systems spanning backend services, APIs, data layers, and frontend
    interfaces
  - Apply systems thinking to ensure reliability, performance, security, permissions,
    and auditability across platforms
  - Participate in production support and incident response for owned systems
  - Mentor AI team members through code reviews, design feedback, and hands-on guidance
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered platforms for internal operations
  - Intelligent automation and orchestration of workflows
  - Customer-facing AI-enhanced shopping experiences
  - Decision support systems for business operations
  - NLP applications including text classification, semantic search, and information
    extraction
  - AI-assisted or agentic systems interacting with tools and data
