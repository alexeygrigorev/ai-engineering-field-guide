    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building data infrastructure for AI
      systems - specifically data pipelines, vector search
      infrastructure, document ingestion, and knowledge base
      management. While the role works with AI technologies
      (embedding models, vector databases, RAG systems), it does
      not involve building, training, fine-tuning, or deploying
      models directly. The engineer provides the data foundation
      and retrieval systems that enable other AI engineers to work
      with models, which is characteristic of an ai-support role.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement documentation ingestion pipelines for AWS Bedrock Knowledge
    Base and other vector stores
  - Build semantic chunking and document processing systems optimized for retrieval
    quality and context preservation
  - Develop vector embedding pipelines with hybrid search strategies combining semantic
    and keyword search
  - Create real-time telemetry collection systems for model monitoring, performance
    tracking, and quality assurance
  - Implement data anonymization and PII detection systems to ensure privacy-compliant
    AI operations
  - Build automated knowledge base refresh and quality monitoring systems for maintaining
    data freshness
  - Optimize vector indexes and database performance for low-latency retrieval at
    scale
  - Collaborate with AI engineers to optimize retrieval strategies and improve RAG
    system performance
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise knowledge management and semantic search
  - RAG-powered AI applications with context-aware responses
  - Real-time data ingestion and processing for AI systems
  - Privacy-compliant document processing and retrieval
  - Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword approaches
  - Model monitoring and quality assurance telemetry
