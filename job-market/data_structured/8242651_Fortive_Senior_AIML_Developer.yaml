      This role focuses on traditional ML frameworks (TensorFlow,
      PyTorch, Scikit-learn) and building ML pipelines for
      training and deployment. While the job title mentions
      "AI/ML," there's no mention of LLMs, RAG, agents, or other
      GenAI technologies - the work is centered on
      supervised/unsupervised learning, feature engineering, and
      MLOps practices.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and automate robust, scalable ML pipelines for training, validation, deployment,
    and monitoring in production environments
  - Collaborate with data scientists, engineers, and product managers to understand
    business requirements and translate them into ML solutions
  - Analyze and process large-scale datasets to develop efficient ML models and drive
    actionable insights
  - Own the end-to-end ML model lifecycle, including versioning, deployment, performance
    monitoring, recalibration, troubleshooting, and retraining
  - Develop and manage CI/CD pipelines for ML workflows, including automated testing,
    containerization, and model registry integration
  - Implement and manage scalable ML infrastructure for data processing, training,
    and inference in collaboration with DevOps and engineering teams
  - Continuously improve engineering practices, code quality, and automation, while
    staying up to date with the latest trends in AI, ML, and MLOps
  use_cases:
  - Repair and maintenance service automation for facilities management
  - Predictive maintenance for industrial and commercial facilities
  - Large-scale data analysis for actionable business insights
  - ML model deployment for facilities management operations
  - IoT and AI-driven innovation for facilities operations
