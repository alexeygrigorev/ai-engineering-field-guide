      This role involves hands-on work with LLMs including fine-
      tuning, optimization, RAG implementation, and building AI
      agents/automations. The engineer will directly architect
      data systems for AI agents and apply model-tuning techniques
      to optimize LLMs for specific marketing tasks.
  responsibilities:
  - Apply AI theory to design and implement large-scale data systems that feed AI
    agents and autonomous workflows
  - Fine-tune, evaluate, and optimize LLMs for marketing tasks including attribution
    insights, anomaly detection, summarization, classification, and recommendations
  - Build end-to-end automations using LLMs, internal data, and external signals to
    eliminate repetitive human tasks
  - Design retrieval, orchestration, and memory layers that make AI agents smarter
    over time
  - Establish best practices for AI data quality, observability, experiments, and
    safety
  - Lead R&D initiatives including rapid prototyping, experimentation, model evaluations,
    and productionization
  - Mentor data scientists and engineers on LLM use across the organization
  use_cases:
  - Marketing attribution insights and analysis
  - Anomaly detection for marketing performance
  - Content summarization and classification
  - Automated marketing recommendations
  - AI-driven workflow automation to reduce manual tasks
  - Decisioning engines for marketing intelligence
