  - Work closely with development partners and stakeholders to iteratively design,
    develop, and deliver AI-enabled products
  - Participate in on-call duties for production systems
  use_cases:
  - Search and analytics of observability data using Generative AI technologies
  - AI agent-driven conversational user interfaces for data interaction
  - RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) applications for querying observability data
  - AI-powered integrations to solve IT and Security data needs
  - Customer-facing AI features that enhance data exploration and analysis
