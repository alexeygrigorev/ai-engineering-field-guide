      The role involves building and owning AI orchestration
      systems, agents, and workflows using LLMs. The engineer is
      directly responsible for turning frontier models into
      production-grade systems through routing, tool calling, and
      MCP servers - hands-on work with AI models, not just
      supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead multi-quarter initiatives across AI, product, and infrastructure including
    orchestration layers, retrieval systems, and unified knowledge bases
  - Architect and implement backend services powering generative AI agents and complex
    workflows like tax filing, advisory, and audit
  - Build and evolve AI orchestration including routing, tool calling, MCP servers,
    multi-step workflows, and safety guardrails around LLMs
  - Design high-throughput, low-latency AI workloads with caching, queuing, rate-limiting,
    and model failover strategies
  - Work with large-scale data including millions of documents, retrieval systems,
    vector stores, and indexing strategies
  - Establish SLOs, observability, and incident response for AI systems requiring
    correctness, auditability, and trustworthiness
  use_cases:
  - AI-native tax and accounting products used by accountants on real client work
  - Tax filing assistance through AI agents and workflows
  - Advisory and audit support using generative AI and document analysis
  - Document-centric experiences for tax professionals analyzing millions of documents
  - AI agents and conversational interfaces for accounting workflows
  - Knowledge base and retrieval systems for tax laws and regulations
