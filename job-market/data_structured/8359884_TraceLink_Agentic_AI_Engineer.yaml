  title: Agentic AI Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role is explicitly building agentic AI/GenAI systems
      including RAG pipelines, multi-agent workflows, and fine-
      tuning language models. This is hands-on work directly
      implementing AI models and agent systems, not supporting
      infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Support the design and implementation of agentic AI/GenAI systems that assist
    in automating supply chain workflows
  - Build and maintain backend services and integrations using Python and/or Java
  - Contribute to multi-agent workflows including tool execution, routing, agent collaboration
    patterns, and task orchestration
  - Assist in creating testing and validation strategies for AI systems including
    evaluation datasets, regression testing, and behavior monitoring
  - Help implement and improve knowledge base systems including RAG pipelines, grounding
    strategies, and retrieval quality improvements
  - Contribute to experimentation with lightweight fine-tuning approaches for small
    language models and reinforcement-learning-inspired improvement loops
  use_cases:
  - Automating supply chain workflows in pharmaceutical industry
  - Knowledge-based retrieval for supply chain decision making
  - Multi-agent task orchestration for enterprise operations
  - Testing and validation of non-deterministic AI systems
  - Fine-tuning small language models for domain-specific applications
