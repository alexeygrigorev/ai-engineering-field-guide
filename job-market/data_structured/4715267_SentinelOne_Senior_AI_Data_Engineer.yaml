    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role is focused on building and maintaining datasets
      that power AI models rather than directly building,
      training, or deploying models. The responsibilities
      emphasize data collection, cleaning, labeling, and pipeline
      development to support AI/ML teams, which is characteristic
      of an ai-support role.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and maintain datasets that power training, fine-tuning, and prompting of
    AI models for cybersecurity applications
  - Explore and curate structured and unstructured security data (logs, malware, alerts,
    incidents) to improve model relevance and effectiveness
  - Develop pipelines for data collection, cleaning, labeling, and versioning
  - Collaborate with researchers and engineers to define data requirements and ensure
    relevance to cybersecurity problems
  - Contribute to evaluation design and automation to ensure continuous improvement
    of AI systems
  - Drive data quality and coverage for use cases like summarization, classification,
    detection, and reasoning over security context
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered cybersecurity threat detection and analysis
  - Alert summarization to help security defenders quickly understand incidents
  - Classification of security events, malware, and threat types
  - Automated reasoning over security context for threat intelligence
  - Fine-tuning AI models with curated cybersecurity datasets for improved accuracy
