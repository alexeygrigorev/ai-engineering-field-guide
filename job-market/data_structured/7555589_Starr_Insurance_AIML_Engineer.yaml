  title: AI/ML Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves designing, developing, and deploying AI/ML
      solutions with hands-on work in machine learning, deep
      learning, and foundational models. The engineer will fine-
      tune, evaluate, and implement foundation models directly,
      which is core ai-first work rather than support or
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and deploy AI/ML solutions using statistics, machine learning,
    deep learning, and foundational models to improve profitability
  - Implement classification models, forecasting, propensity and uplift modeling,
    and foundational model fine-tuning, evaluation, and implementation
