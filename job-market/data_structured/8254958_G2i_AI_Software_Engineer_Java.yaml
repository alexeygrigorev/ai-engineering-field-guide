      This role involves hands-on work with LLMs through RLHF
      (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback), directly
      participating in the model training process by ranking code,
      providing feedback, and injecting data into the training
      pipeline. The engineer's expertise directly shapes how the
      AI model learns and improves its code generation
      capabilities.
  responsibilities:
  - Compare and rank multiple code snippets, explaining which is best and why
  - Repair and refactor AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and style
  - Inject feedback including ratings, edits, and test results into the RLHF pipeline
  - Maintain smooth operation of the RLHF pipeline for continuous model improvement
  - Apply strong code-review instincts to spot logic errors, performance traps, and
    security issues
  - Provide clear written explanations justifying code quality decisions
  use_cases:
  - Training large language models to write production-grade code across multiple
    programming languages
  - Converting expert code review feedback into reward signals for reinforcement learning
  - Teaching models to propose, critique, and improve code similar to expert engineers
  - Improving AI code generation through iterative RLHF processes
