      This is an AI Infrastructure role focused on building cloud
      platforms, IaC, CI/CD pipelines, and orchestration systems
      that support AI/ML workloads rather than directly building
      or deploying models. While the role mentions some exposure
      to LLMs and ML algorithms, the primary responsibilities are
      infrastructure engineering - creating the platforms and
      environments that enable other teams to work with AI models.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and maintain cloud infrastructure on AWS and Azure to support AI/ML
    workloads
  - Implement Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and manage containerization with
    Docker and Kubernetes
  - Design, test, code, and instrument AI/ML platforms and tools for model development
  - Develop and maintain CI/CD pipelines for automating AI infrastructure and ML model
    deployment
  - Implement monitoring and alerting systems to ensure health and performance of
    production AI infrastructure
  - Collaborate with stakeholders to understand AI development team requirements and
    key challenges
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered commerce and payments platform enhancing business decision-making
  - Large Language Models for generative AI projects in financial services
  - Machine learning platforms for risk assessment and fraud detection
  - Big data analytics infrastructure for business intelligence and customer insights
  - AI-driven products to help customers grow their business effectively
