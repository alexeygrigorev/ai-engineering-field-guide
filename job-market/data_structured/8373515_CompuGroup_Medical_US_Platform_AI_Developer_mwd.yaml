      The role involves hands-on development of LLM-powered
      agentic applications, building RAG systems, orchestrating
      multi-agent architectures, and deploying foundation models.
      This is direct work on AI systems rather than supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Development and operation of a microservice-based agent mesh that is highly scalable,
    multi-tenant, and secure by design
  - Orchestration of agentic systems and multi-agent architectures using frameworks
    like LangChain, CrewAI, or Semantic Kernel
  - Integration and productive deployment of foundation models from providers like
    OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face, and Mistral
  - Design and implementation of intelligent backend components for context management,
    RAG, memory, tool use, and agentic collaboration
  - Building pipelines for prompt optimization, inference control, and usage analytics
  - Collaboration with frontend, UX, and infrastructure teams to bring AI solutions
    into end-to-end production
  use_cases:
  - Multi-agent systems for healthcare applications
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for knowledge retrieval in healthcare
  - Intelligent backend components for context management and tool use in healthcare
    workflows
  - AI-powered orchestration of healthcare processes
  - Scalable and secure AI systems for healthcare enterprise deployment
