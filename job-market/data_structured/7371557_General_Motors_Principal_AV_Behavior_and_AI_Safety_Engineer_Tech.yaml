    reasoning: |-
      This is a safety and validation leadership role for
      autonomous vehicle systems, focused on setting safety
      standards, assurance processes, and validation strategies
      for AI/ML models rather than building, training, or
      deploying the models themselves. The role involves
      establishing safety frameworks (ISO 8800, ISO 21448),
      validating AI-driven systems, and providing technical
      guidance to engineering teams - all support functions that
      enable safe AI development rather than hands-on model work.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop AI/ML and autonomous system safety strategy using ISO 8800, ISO 21448,
    and industry best practices for development, deployment, and maintenance
  - Work with software, data science, and systems engineering teams to ensure safe
    training of machine learning models for autonomous systems
  - Establish safety standards for prototyping, testing, and deploying new AI solutions
    including Generative AI
  - Set strategy for testing and validation of datasets and develop comprehensive
    assurance plans
  - Define systematic approach to breaking down operational design domain components
    and driving behavior components for validation
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to establish safety launch targets across
    vehicle behaviors and develop assurance processes
  use_cases:
  - Level 4 autonomous driving features and vehicle behaviors
  - AI/ML model safety validation for autonomous vehicles
  - Generative AI solutions for autonomous driving systems
  - Large Language Model applications in automotive safety contexts
  - Operational design domain validation for autonomous driving
