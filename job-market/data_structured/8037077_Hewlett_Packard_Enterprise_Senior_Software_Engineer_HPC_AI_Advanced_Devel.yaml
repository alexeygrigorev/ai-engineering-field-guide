      This role focuses on HPC infrastructure, distributed
      systems, and data pipelines for simulation telemetry. While
      there are "nice to have" mentions of AI surrogates and LLMs,
      the core responsibilities involve building scalable
      workflows, data analysis infrastructure, and distributed
      memory programming - all supporting technologies for AI/HPC
      workloads rather than directly building or deploying AI
      models.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop distributed HPC/AI workflows for processing large-scale telemetry datasets
    (terabytes to petabytes)
  - Compose and integrate open-source solutions using distributed and parallel programming
    approaches for scaling data and simulations
  - Collaborate in consensus-driven design processes and Agile development environments
  - Create technical documentation, collaborate with users, and present progress through
    various communication channels
  use_cases:
  - Scaling high-fidelity discrete-event simulations on HPE supercomputers using distributed
    memory and checkpointing
  - Distributed large-scale data analysis of traces, logs, and telemetry data from
    simulations and HPC systems
  - Interactive processing of massive telemetry datasets for HPC system monitoring
    and analysis
  - Digital twin software development integrated with visualization tools and AI/ML
    workflows
  - AI surrogate development for real-time HPC system error detection
  - LLM-powered chat interfaces for analysis and development environments
