      This role is a Data Engineer focused on building data
      pipelines, infrastructure, and platforms that support ML and
      LLM workloads. The engineer enables AI work by providing
      scalable data architecture, vector databases, and feature
      stores, but does not build, train, fine-tune, or deploy
      models directly. The role explicitly states they partner
      with data scientists and AI software engineers to support
      model development, which is characteristic of ai-support.

    data sources
  - Develop and optimize data models, ETL processes, and batch/streaming data infrastructure
  - Partner with data scientists to support training, evaluation, and deployment of
    ML and LLM models
  - Implement scalable architectures for embeddings, vector databases, and retrieval
    pipelines
  - Ensure data quality, lineage, observability, and governance across all data products
  - Deploy secure, cloud-native data infrastructure for high-volume AI workloads
  - Contribute to the design of feature stores and MLOps platforms for continuous
    learning and model updates
  use_cases:
  - HR and employee experience management through intelligent AI applications
  - ML and LLM model training, evaluation, and deployment for HR workflows
  - Vector search and retrieval pipelines for enterprise knowledge management
  - Real-time and offline analytics for workplace insights and decision-making
  - Compliant data usage with Responsible AI workflows in regulated HR environments
