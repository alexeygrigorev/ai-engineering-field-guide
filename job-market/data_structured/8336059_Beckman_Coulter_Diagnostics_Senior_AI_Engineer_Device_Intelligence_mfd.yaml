    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves designing and implementing advanced AI
      systems including LLMs, agentic workflows, and computer
      vision technologies. The engineer will work hands-on with
      models, RAG approaches, and vector databases to extract
      insights from device data, directly building and deploying
      AI systems rather than just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Collaborate with the Senior Director and broader team to develop AI-driven product
    improvements and create new products for Danaher devices, with initial focus on
    imaging devices
  - Design and implement advanced AI systems including next-generation agentic workflows,
    LLMs and computer vision technologies to enhance instrument automation
  - Work closely with cross-functional and cross company teams to translate product
    concepts into concrete AI architectures, ensuring alignment with product success
    criteria and measurable KPIs
  - Lead the technical implementation of AI projects of notable complexity, involving
    multiple functions and typically spanning multi-quarter timelines
  - Drive innovation in the AI software stack, focusing on maximizing value extraction
    from instruments for customers through AI systems
  - Collaborate with business stakeholders, technical experts, and subject matter
    experts to build comprehensive AI roadmaps for imaging products across various
    verticals
  use_cases:
  - Extract meaningful insights from data created by Danaher diagnostic and life science
    devices
  - Enhance imaging device automation and user capabilities through AI-driven analysis
  - Improve user experience for diagnostic and biotechnology instruments using AI
  - Leverage multimodal AI combining computer vision with LLMs for instrument intelligence
  - Enable automated instrument control and enhanced automation for scientific equipment
