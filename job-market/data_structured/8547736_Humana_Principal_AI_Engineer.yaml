      This role focuses on building internal developer platforms
      and infrastructure that ENABLE agentic AI development for
      other teams, not building the AI systems themselves. The
      Principal AI Engineer architects cloud infrastructure, CI/CD
      pipelines, developer tooling, and platform services that
      support agent-driven applications - which is
      infrastructure/platform work for AI teams rather than hands-
      on model/agent development.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the design, development, and evolution of internal developer platforms tailored
    for agentic AI use cases
  - Architect, deploy, and manage core infrastructure and platform services on cloud
    platforms, leveraging agentic AI and ML services
  - Build and maintain robust CI/CD and agentic AI pipeline automation for automated
    testing, deployment, and agent lifecycle management
  - Develop scalable backend services and APIs using Python specifically designed
    to power agentic AI platform functionalities
  - Establish comprehensive monitoring, logging, tracing, and alerting systems for
    agent workflows, models, and applications
  - Partner with application, data science, security, and operations teams to understand
    agentic AI needs and evolve the platform
  use_cases:
  - Agentic AI systems for autonomous action and complex reasoning across multiple
    environments
  - Agent orchestration and human-AI collaboration workflows
  - Self-service agent training, deployment, and monitoring for application and data
    science teams
  - Enterprise-wide agent-driven applications for healthcare operations
  - Internal developer tools for building and deploying AI agents at scale
