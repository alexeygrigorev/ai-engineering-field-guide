      The role focuses on using GenAI tools to accelerate
      development and build internal developer tools (coding
      assistants, documentation, testing), not on building,
      training, or deploying AI models. The engineer acts as a

    across the software development lifecycle
  - Work hands-on in product codebases using GenAI tools to accelerate development,
    improve quality, and simplify systems
  - Build and evolve AI-powered internal tools and workflows including coding assistants,
    reviews, documentation, and testing tools
  - Act as a multiplier and culture driver by coaching teams on effective GenAI usage
    and establishing AI-first ways of working
  - Run small, data-informed experiments to test AI approaches and turn successful
    patterns into repeatable standards and playbooks
  - Apply AI-first principles to design, coding, testing, deployment, and operations
    in a you-build-it-you-run-it environment
  use_cases:
  - Internal developer productivity tools including coding assistants, code reviews,
    and documentation generators
  - Automated testing and code quality improvement using GenAI tools
  - Workflow automation for software development processes including debugging and
    refactoring
  - AI-powered development acceleration and innovation across engineering teams
  - Code generation and decision support for engineering productivity
