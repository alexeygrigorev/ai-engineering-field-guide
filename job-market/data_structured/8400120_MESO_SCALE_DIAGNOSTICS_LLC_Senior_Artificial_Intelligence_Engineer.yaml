    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work building, fine-tuning, and
      deploying AI models and systems including RAG, model fine-
      tuning, knowledge distillation, and on-premise deployment.
      The engineer is directly working ON AI/ML systems -
      implementing retrieval systems, optimizing models, and
      engineering reasoning capabilities in LLMs, not just
      supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems with semantic
    and traditional search capabilities
  - Develop and optimize vector search systems and data pipelines for model fine-tuning
  - Execute model fine-tuning experiments, knowledge distillation, and design prompt
    engineering strategies
  - Build fault-tolerant applications integrating with AWS Bedrock and SageMaker
  - Implement production-grade Python backends for AI-powered features
  - Optimize models for on-premise deployment in data center environments
  - Manage model deployment, monitoring, and engineer reasoning capabilities in self-hosted
    models
  - Develop evaluation frameworks for RAG and fine-tuning performance
  use_cases:
  - Information retrieval using semantic and vector search capabilities
  - Knowledge distillation to create smaller models for on-premise deployment
  - Prompt engineering and in-context learning for enhanced model performance
  - Model optimization and reasoning capabilities for self-hosted environments
  - Production AI systems leveraging AWS Bedrock and SageMaker services
  - Robust evaluation frameworks for assessing model performance and trade-offs
