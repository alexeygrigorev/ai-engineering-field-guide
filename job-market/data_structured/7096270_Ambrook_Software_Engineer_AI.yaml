      This role involves building LLM-powered features for
      production including document parsing, transaction
      categorization, and financial workflows. The engineer will
      develop intelligent systems using LLMs, NLP, and implement
      evaluation pipelines and prompt management - directly
      working on AI systems rather than just supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop intelligent systems and tools using LLMs, NLP, and heuristics to streamline
    bookkeeping, inbox triage, and financial workflows
  - Build and ship AI-powered features such as parsing paper documents and categorizing
    financial transactions
  - Establish foundations for evaluation pipelines, prompt management, and feedback
    loops to improve LLM performance
  - Implement systems for document extraction and financial transaction tagging using
    both heuristics and model-based approaches
  - Architect and scale systems for automated bookkeeping using hybrid AI and rule-based
    approaches
  - Contribute to AI strategy including task automation decisions, confidence measurement,
    and human-in-the-loop design
  - Build internal tooling for prompt iteration, embedding search, labeling, and retraining
  use_cases:
  - Cleaning and categorizing messy financial transactions from unstructured sources
  - Parsing and extracting data from scanned PDFs and other paper financial documents
  - Summarizing financial documents to surface key insights for farmers and ranchers
  - Inbox triage and processing of text-heavy communications
  - Automated bookkeeping and financial analysis for agricultural businesses
  - Hybrid AI + rule-based systems for high-stakes financial workflows
