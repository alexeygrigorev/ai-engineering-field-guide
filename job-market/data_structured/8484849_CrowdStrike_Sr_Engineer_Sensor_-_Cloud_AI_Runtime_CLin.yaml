    reasoning: |-
      This is a systems engineering role that builds security
      infrastructure and runtime protection for cloud and AI
      workloads. The engineer works on low-level Linux components
      using C++, eBPF, and kernel modules to protect AI
      infrastructure, but does not build, train, deploy, or fine-
      tune any AI models themselves. The role focuses on securing
      AI workloads rather than developing AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Build comprehensive runtime security solutions for Cloud and AI workloads deployed
    at scale
  - Design and develop highly scalable and performant Linux system software components
    for security
  - Engage and influence cutting edge security designs of Major Cloud & AI service
    providers through partnerships
  - Ensure systems and components reliability and performance through monitoring,
    testing, and debugging
  - Lead strategic technical initiatives focusing on AI workloads, VMs, Containers
    and Orchestrators security
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate sensor and cloud solutions
  use_cases:
  - Runtime security monitoring for cloud-native workloads
  - Security for AI and ML infrastructure across Kubernetes environments
  - Detection and prevention of threats in dynamic cloud environments
  - Lightweight sensor-based protection for millions of systems
  - Visibility into AI workload execution and behavior
  - Security for containerized and virtualized workloads
