    for medical image processing
  - Establish and enforce rigorous data quality frameworks, validation checks, and
    security protocols compliant with HIPAA standards
  - Lead technical strategy and best practices in data engineering, DataOps, and infrastructure
    management with ownership of tooling decisions
  - Partner with AI and research teams as the primary technical expert to understand
    requirements and build solutions that accelerate model development
