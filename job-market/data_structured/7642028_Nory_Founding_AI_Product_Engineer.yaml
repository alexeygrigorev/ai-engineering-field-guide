      This is a hands-on engineering role building production
      agentic workflows and LLM-powered systems, not supporting
      infrastructure. The engineer will directly architect,
      deploy, and operate multi-step agent systems that deliver
      real-time intelligence to restaurant operators.
  responsibilities:
  - Own production AI systems end-to-end including reliability, monitoring, alerting,
    and on-call responsibility
  - Design and build backend services incorporating multi-step agentic workflows with
    explicit failure and retry handling
  - Transform prototypes into shipped, customer-facing features and iterate based
    on real usage
  - Integrate LLM-powered capabilities into core Nory workflows in collaboration with
    Product and Data teams
  - Make pragmatic trade-offs around latency, cost, accuracy, and user trust for AI
    systems
  - Establish best practices and patterns for building and operating agentic systems
    at scale

  - Real-time data analysis and AI predictive analytics for restaurant operations
  - Food prep optimization and forecasting to reduce waste and improve margins
  - Operational intelligence system providing control over restaurant margins and
    consistency
  - Agent-backed features delivering actionable insights to restaurant operators
