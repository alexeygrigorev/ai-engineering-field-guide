  title: Staff AI Software Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building AI infrastructure, data
      pipelines, and MLOps tools rather than directly developing
      or fine-tuning models. The engineer creates foundational
      systems and frameworks that enable other AI teams to deploy
      models, working primarily on supporting infrastructure and
      tooling.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop data pipelines and curation workflows for perception, locomotion, and
    manipulation tasks
  - Design and maintain scalable AI infrastructure including shared libraries, model
    training pipelines, and evaluation frameworks
  - Build dashboards, visualization tools, and metrics to monitor model performance
    and operational readiness
  - Implement testing, validation, and reproducibility tools for reliable model deployment
    on Digit
  - Collaborate with skills and control teams to integrate models into real-time production
    systems
  - Promote best practices for data management, experiment tracking, and ML operations
    across the organization
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous robot navigation and mobility in human-occupied spaces
  - Perception systems for environment understanding and object detection
  - Robotic manipulation for picking, carrying, and handling objects
  - Real-time model execution for safe human-robot interaction
  - Learning-based capabilities for dexterous robot operations
