      This is an AI-first role focused on building, fine-tuning,
      deploying, and optimizing LLM-based systems. The role
      directly involves model training with parameter-efficient
      fine-tuning methods (LoRA, QLoRA), RAG pipelines, prompt
      engineering, and model serving - all hands-on work with AI
      models rather than support infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement traditional ML and LLM-based systems and applications
  - Optimize model inference performance and cost efficiency
  - Fine-tune foundation models for specific use cases and domains
  - Implement diverse prompt engineering strategies
  - Build robust backend infrastructure for AI-powered applications
  - Implement and maintain MLOps pipelines for AI lifecycle management
  - Design and implement comprehensive traditional ML and LLM monitoring and evaluation
    systems
  - Develop automated testing frameworks for model quality and performance tracking
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise data solutions for Fortune 500 companies
  - RAG-powered knowledge retrieval systems
  - Fine-tuned LLMs for domain-specific applications
  - Production-scale AI model deployment
  - Automated model evaluation and monitoring
  - Real-time AI-powered backend APIs
