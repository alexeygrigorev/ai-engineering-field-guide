  title: Senior Math Libraries Engineer – Emulation in AI and HPC
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on developing GPU math libraries and
      numerical dense linear algebra software that enable AI
      workloads, rather than directly building, training, or
      deploying AI/ML models. The engineer works on foundational
      infrastructure (CUDA kernels, precision emulation, hardware
      optimization) that supports AI applications, making it an
      enabling/support role.
  responsibilities:
  - Scoping, designing, and implementing high quality and performance numerical dense
    linear algebra software on GPUs
  - Providing technical leadership and feedback to library engineers and mentor interns
    on projects
  - Working closely with product management and internal/external customers to understand
    requirements and define technical roadmaps
  - Finding opportunities to improve library performance and reduce code maintenance
    overhead through re-architecting
  use_cases:
  - GPU accelerated math libraries for AI kernel generation and HPC applications
  - Emulation of math operations across different precision formats for scientific
    computing
  - Numerical dense linear algebra operations powering AI training and inference
  - Support for applications in healthcare, NLP, VR, deep learning, and autonomous
    vehicles
  - Data center computing powered by GPUs for scientific and engineering simulations
