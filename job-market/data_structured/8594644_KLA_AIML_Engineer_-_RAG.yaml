  title: AI/ML Engineer - RAG
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is an AI-first role focused on building RAG systems
      that directly work with LLMs and retrieval mechanisms. The
      engineer will design, implement, and optimize end-to-end RAG
      pipelines including embeddings, retrieval, reranking, and
      answer generation - all hands-on work with AI models and
      systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement robust RAG pipelines including ingestion, parsing, chunking,
    enrichment, embedding, indexing, retrieval, reranking, and answer generation
  - Choose and tune retrieval strategies (dense, sparse/lexical, and hybrid) to maximize
    recall and precision for enterprise queries
  - Implement and optimize vector and hybrid search over structured and unstructured
    data with reranking strategies and fusion methods
  - Define evaluation harnesses for retrieval and generation using offline datasets
    and online telemetry with automated regression tests
  - Optimize latency and throughput using caching, batching, streaming responses,
    and efficient retrieval/index configurations
  - Implement document-level security and access control in retrieval with ACL-aware
    indexing and query-time authorization
  - Partner with domain owners and engineering teams to prioritize use cases and integrate
    RAG into products and workflows
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise knowledge management systems with grounded LLM responses
  - Document search and retrieval across wikis, tickets, logs, and metadata
  - Intelligent question answering with reduced hallucinations and improved answer
    reliability
  - Internal enterprise search with access control and security compliance
  - Automated information retrieval and knowledge synthesis from structured and unstructured
    data
