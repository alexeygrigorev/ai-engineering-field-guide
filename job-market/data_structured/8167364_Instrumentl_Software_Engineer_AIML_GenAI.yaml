      This role involves hands-on work building agentic LLM
      systems, implementing RAG pipelines, managing embeddings and
      vector stores, and running fine-tuning with SFT/LoRA. The
      engineer will directly build, deploy, and optimize AI models
      and systems for production, not just support infrastructure
      or data pipelines for AI work.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and deploy agentic LLM systems with tool/function calling capabilities
    for grant discovery, application drafting, and research assistance
  - Own end-to-end RAG implementation including document ingestion, chunking, embedding
    strategies, hybrid retrieval, re-ranking, and grounding
  - Manage embeddings at scale including model selection, versioning, vector store
    maintenance, and index health monitoring
  - Run fine-tuning with SFT/LoRA and build comprehensive evaluation harnesses for
    measuring helpfulness, groundedness, and hallucinations
  - Collaborate cross-functionally with Product, Design, and GTM on feature scoping,
    experimentation, and iteration based on user feedback
  - Implement reliability practices including observability, alerts, dashboards, and
    incident response for AI production systems
  use_cases:
  - Grant discovery automation using agentic AI systems
  - Grant application drafting assistance with LLMs
  - Research assistance for nonprofit fundraising activities
  - Hybrid retrieval search across grant databases and domain data
  - Grounded and citable AI responses with RAG pipelines
