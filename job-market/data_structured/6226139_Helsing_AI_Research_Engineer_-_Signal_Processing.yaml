  title: AI Research Engineer - Signal Processing
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves building AI-based signal processing
      systems with hands-on work implementing advanced ML
      algorithms, deploying them to real-world scenarios with
      hardware constraints. The role requires experience in
      conceptualizing and implementing AI-based systems, keeping
      up with state-of-the-art ML research, and
      reimplementing/extending it, which indicates direct work on
      AI models rather than just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and extend state-of-the-art signal processing algorithms and AI-based
    systems
  - Apply and deploy signal processing technology in real-world scenarios including
    sky and underwater domains
  - Build in-house solutions for signal processing problems with high generalization
    capabilities
  - Implement systems that meet hardware constraints and ensure robustness against
    adversarial attacks
  - Collaborate across teams with diverse technical backgrounds
  - Deploy AI software to production including testing, quality assurance, and monitoring
  use_cases:
  - Signal processing for aerial/sky surveillance systems
  - Underwater signal detection and analysis
  - AI-assisted human decision-making in defense scenarios
  - Robust perception systems for military applications
  - Time frequency analysis and parameter estimation for defense intelligence
