    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work building and deploying LLM-
      based systems including RAG pipelines, agent workflows, and
      model integration into production microservices. The
      engineer directly implements AI capabilities like retrieval
      orchestration, prompt engineering, and multi-agent systems
      rather than just supporting infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build core AI platform services powering advisor-facing features like
    intelligent insights and meeting summaries
  - Develop and maintain RAG and semantic search pipelines for secure financial data
    access and reasoning
  - Integrate foundation models from OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, and Azure OpenAI
    into scalable microservices and APIs
  - Create and manage prompt orchestration and versioning frameworks for consistent
    AI responses across products
  - Develop evaluation, monitoring, and observability systems to ensure AI quality
    and compliance in production
  - Optimize inference performance, latency, and cost through model routing, caching,
    and fine-tuning strategies
  use_cases:
  - Intelligent advisor insights and recommendations
  - Automated meeting summaries for client interactions
  - Semantic search over financial documents and data
  - Personalized financial advice at scale
  - Multi-agent workflows for complex financial tasks
