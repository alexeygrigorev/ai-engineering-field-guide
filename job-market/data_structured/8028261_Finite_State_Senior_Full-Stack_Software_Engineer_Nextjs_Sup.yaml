    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a full-stack software engineer role that uses AI
      tools (Cursor, Copilot, Devin) to accelerate development
      workflows and build internal agents for automation tasks.
      However, the role focuses on building cybersecurity platform
      applications using Next.js and Supabase, not on developing,
      training, or deploying AI/ML models themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and maintain secure, scalable web applications using Next.js, React, TypeScript,
    and Node with PostgreSQL on Supabase
  - Design and implement business logic close to the data using Postgres functions,
    views, triggers, Row-Level Security, and Supabase Edge Functions
  - Leverage AI-assisted development tools like Cursor, Devin, and GitHub Copilot
    to scaffold features, generate schemas, and build internal automation agents
  - Embed security best practices across all development layers including secure coding,
    dependency management, and authentication/authorization
  - Collaborate with product managers and designers to translate customer needs into
    impactful features while providing technical and data-informed guidance
  - Design and optimize API contracts, edge endpoints, and event flows considering
    performance, resiliency, and multi-region deployment
  - Model and optimize relational data in PostgreSQL for large multi-tenant workloads
    with proper indexing strategies and query performance tuning
  - Support automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, database migrations, and vulnerability
    scanning throughout the development lifecycle
  use_cases:
  - Provides transparency and security analysis for connected devices and embedded
    systems across industries
  - Analyzes firmware builds by unpacking and examining every file, configuration,
    and setting to generate complete software bill of materials
  - Identifies known vulnerabilities and zero-day threats in IoT and connected device
    software supply chains
  - Generates contextual risk scores and actionable remediation guidance for product
    security teams
  - Secures critical infrastructure including medical devices, power grids, telecommunications
    networks, and connected vehicles
  - Helps manufacturers maintain device production timelines and budgets while managing
    cybersecurity risks
