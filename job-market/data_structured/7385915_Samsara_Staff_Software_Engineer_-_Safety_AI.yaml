    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a Staff Software Engineer role building
      infrastructure and workflows that consume AI outputs from
      Samsara's AI Dash Cam products, rather than building or
      training the AI models themselves. The role focuses on
      software architecture, state machines, event ingestion
      systems, and web/mobile applications that utilize AI for
      safety insights, which is supporting AI functionality rather
      than working directly on AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect, design, and develop software that enables enterprise fleets to operate
    at scale
  - Influence the vision and roadmap for the fleet safety team to support rapid growth
  - Design and build a streamlined state machine for event ingestion and tracking
  - Architect an improved safety event mocking system to dramatically improve automated
    and manual testing capabilities
  - Lead the response to production issues across services and levels of the stack
  - Champion, role model, and embed Samsara's cultural principles as we scale globally
  use_cases:
  - Video-based safety monitoring using AI dash cams to detect driving events
  - Real-time driver feedback systems to improve safe driving practices
  - Video-based coaching workflows for fleet safety programs
  - Safety event tracking and analysis for fleet management
  - Driver exoneration through video evidence collection in no-fault accidents
