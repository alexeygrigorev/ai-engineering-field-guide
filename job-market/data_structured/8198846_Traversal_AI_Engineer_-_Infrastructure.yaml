position:
  title: AI Engineer - Infrastructure

    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is an AI Infrastructure Engineer role focused on
      building the platform and reliability systems that power
      Traversal's AI products. The role involves designing and
      operating infrastructure for inference, data pipelines, and
      agentic workflows, but does not directly build, train, or
      fine-tune models - rather it creates the systems that enable
      AI systems to run reliably at scale.
  responsibilities:
  - Design scalable, reliable infrastructure for AI inference, data pipelines, and
    agentic workflows
  - Migrate from Python multiprocessing + Postgres-as-queue to Kubernetes-native queuing
    and orchestration using KEDA/HPA, Jobs/CronJobs, and Kueue/Argo
  - Operate and tune managed Kafka systems including partitioning, throughput optimization,
    DLQ design, and idempotent sink implementation
  - Implement autoscaling based on real signals like queue lag, in-flight requests,
    and latency with burst capacity and safe drains
  - Productionize MCP toolchains with reliability patterns including circuit breaking,
    timeouts, sandboxing, and audit logging
  - Build observability systems with RED/USE dashboards and OpenTelemetry traces across
    gateway, agent, tool, Kafka, and sink layers
  - Manage infrastructure as code using Terraform, Helm, and Kustomize for multi-environment
    deployments with policy-as-code and workload identity
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered site reliability engineering and production incident troubleshooting
    for enterprises
  - High-concurrency AI inference serving for Fortune 50 companies with multi-tenancy
  - Agentic tooling and workflows via MCP for automated incident remediation and prevention
  - Real-time data pipeline processing using Kafka for AI agent operations and event
    streaming
  - Enterprise-grade AI infrastructure with SOC 2 Type II compliance for secure, reliable
    AI operations
  - Autonomous production issue resolution to free engineers from manual firefighting
