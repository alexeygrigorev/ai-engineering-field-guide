    reasoning: |-
      This is an AI/ML Platform and MLOps infrastructure role
      focused on building the systems and tooling that SUPPORT ML
      work rather than directly building, training, or deploying
      models. The responsibilities center on MLOps infrastructure,
      CI/CD pipelines, feature stores, model versioning, and
      backend services that enable data scientists and ML
      engineers.

  - Own the long-term technical roadmap, design, and implementation of highly available
    and performant services and infrastructure across the AI/ML platform
  - Serve as a technical leader driving alignment across engineering, data science,
    product, and security teams on platform requirements and best practices
  - Define and implement the strategic vision for MLOps including model versioning,
    feature stores, drift monitoring, and CI/CD pipelines for regulated healthcare
    data
  - Lead the development of resilient, high-throughput backend services and APIs that
    integrate ML system components with core services
  - Mentor and coach senior and mid-level engineers, raising the bar for engineering
    excellence, system observability, testing, and documentation
  - Act as a critical escalation point for complex production issues, debugging and
    optimizing performance bottlenecks across services and infrastructure
  use_cases:
  - Automate prior authorization document processing for health insurance companies
  - Process regulated healthcare data with rigorous security and compliance standards
  - Enable ML model operations including versioning, monitoring, and deployment in
    a polyglot environment
  - Provide scalable backend infrastructure to support AI/ML services in healthcare
