      The role is hands-on building multi-agent AI systems using
      LangGraph, implementing RAG with vector databases, fine-
      tuning agents with RLHF/RLAIF, and deploying autonomous AI
      workflows. This is direct work ON AI systems, not supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and develop multi-agent AI systems using LangGraph for workflow automation,
    complex decision-making, and autonomous problem-solving
  - Build memory-augmented, context-aware AI agents capable of planning, reasoning,
    and executing tasks across multiple domains
  - Develop and optimize agent orchestration workflows using LangGraph, ensuring high
    performance, modularity, and scalability
  - Implement knowledge graphs, vector databases, and retrieval-augmented generation
    (RAG) techniques for enhanced agent reasoning
  - Apply reinforcement learning (RLHF/RLAIF) methodologies to fine-tune AI agents
    for improved decision-making
  - Lead cutting-edge AI research in Agentic AI, LangGraph, LLM Orchestration, and
    Self-improving AI Agents
  - Lead Agentic AI proof-of-concept (PoC) projects that demonstrate tangible business
    impact and scale successful prototypes into production
  - Lead and mentor a team of AI Engineers and Data Scientists, fostering deep technical
    expertise in LangGraph and multi-agent architectures
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise workflow automation through autonomous AI agents
  - Complex decision-making and problem-solving across multiple domains
  - Enhanced agent reasoning using knowledge graphs and RAG techniques
  - Autonomous adaptation and self-learning based on real-time feedback loops
  - Driving automation, operational efficiency, and cost savings in enterprise environments
  - Scalable LLM-powered agent integration with enterprise applications
