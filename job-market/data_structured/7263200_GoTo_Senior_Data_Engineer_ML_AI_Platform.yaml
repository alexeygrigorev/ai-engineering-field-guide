  title: Senior Data Engineer – ML / AI Platform
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses primarily on data engineering (PySpark,
      Airflow, Databricks, data pipelines) and ML infrastructure
      (feature pipelines, MLOps, model deployment) rather than
      hands-on model development or training. The engineer enables
      ML work for others by building the data platform, feature
      engineering pipelines, and MLOps infrastructure that support
      production ML solutions, which aligns with ai-support.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and optimize scalable batch and near-real-time data pipelines using
    PySpark, SQL, Airflow, and Databricks/AWS services
  - Develop and maintain data models for structured and semi-structured datasets
  - Work with Delta Lake, Hive, and Lakehouse architectures to manage large-scale
    datasets efficiently
  - Implement data quality, governance, observability, and security best practices
    across pipelines
  - Design, build, and deploy ML/AI solutions end-to-end for real SaaS use cases
  - Own ML productionization including feature pipelines, training/inference workflows,
    model packaging, deployment, and monitoring
  - Implement and maintain MLOps pipelines including model versioning, retraining
    strategies, performance tracking, and rollback mechanisms
  - Mentor junior engineers and contribute to data platform and engineering best practices
  use_cases:
  - Recommendations for SaaS products
  - Churn prediction and retention analysis
  - Usage intelligence and analytics
  - Anomaly detection for system monitoring
  - Automation of business processes
  - AI-assisted development and data tools
