    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      The role is a Fullstack Product Engineer working on AI
      products but the actual work involves building web
      applications (React/TypeScript/NestJS), talking to
      customers, and shipping features end-to-end. While they use
      AI tools like Cursor and Claude Code for development, they
      are not building, training, fine-tuning, or deploying AI
      models themselves. This is a software engineering role at an
      AI company, not an AI engineering role.
  responsibilities:
  - Ship features end-to-end from problem understanding to production across frontend
    and backend
  - Talk to customers regularly to gather feedback and translate problems into solutions
  - Write production-ready code with tests, edge case handling, and clear documentation
  - Review code thoughtfully and maintain quality standards for the team
  - Debug production issues and implement preventative measures
  - Help cultivate engineering culture as one of the founding engineers of the AI
    & Analytics pod

  - Second Brain for Chief People Officers and HR teams
  - People analytics and querying engines on Snowflake data
  - Enterprise HR platform serving C-level executives
