    reasoning: |-
      This role is a Principal Engineer focused on building Java-
      based frameworks and platform infrastructure. While it
      mentions AI/agent-enablement hooks and integration at the
      foundation layer, the work is enabling other teams to build
      AI capabilities rather than directly building, training, or
      deploying models/agents. This is platform engineering that
      supports AI work (ai-support).
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and enhance shared Java-based frameworks for product development
    teams
  - Improve platform stability, scalability, and fault tolerance across distributed
    systems
  - Contribute to AI/agent-enablement hooks at the foundation layer for next-generation
    capabilities
  - Guide AI/agent framework integration and extensibility at the platform foundation
    layer
  - Mentor engineering teams and establish engineering best practices
  - Identify and resolve potential system issues to minimize operational incidents
  - Collaborate with product scrum teams to ensure framework adoption and effectiveness
  use_cases:
  - Identity Governance Administration for cloud and enterprise systems
  - Cloud security for platforms including Office 365, AWS, Azure, Salesforce, Workday,
    SAP, and Oracle
  - Risk analytics and intelligence integration with privilege management
  - Fine-grained privilege management for enterprise applications
