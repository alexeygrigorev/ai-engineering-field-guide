  title: Lead AI Product Engineer - AI Agents & Emerging Products

    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is a hands-on engineering role focused on building
      multi-agent systems, agentic coding workflows, and LLM-
      powered applications in production. The engineer will
      directly design, implement, and deploy AI agent
      architectures including orchestration layers, RAG systems,
      and agent evaluation pipelines.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and operate multi-agent systems that plan, coordinate, and execute tasks
    across multiple tools and services at scale
  - Implement agentic coding workflows where agents generate code, run tests, create
    diffs or PRs, and iterate autonomously within guardrails
  - Design agent orchestration layers including planners, supervisors, and evaluators
    to manage task decomposition, retries, and long-running execution
  - Instrument and monitor agent behavior across success, failure, latency, cost,
    and human overrides
  - Collaborate with Product & Design to translate user problems into shippable agent
    workflows and iterate based on real-world feedback
  - Own core architecture, reliability, and performance of AI agent systems from early
    prototypes through production
  use_cases:
  - Multi-agent systems that solve real user problems through coordinated task execution
    across tools and services
  - Agentic coding workflows where agents autonomously write, modify, validate, and
    iterate on code within guardrails
  - Consumer products powered by AI agents that deliver value through autonomous task
    planning and execution
  - Long-running, stateful agent workflows that require sophisticated orchestration
    and failure recovery
