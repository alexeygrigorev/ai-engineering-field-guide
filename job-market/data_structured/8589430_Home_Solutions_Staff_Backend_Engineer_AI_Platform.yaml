  name: Home Solutions
  stage: Series B
  focus: AI-powered customer acquisition platform for home services
position:
  title: Staff Backend Engineer, AI Platform
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a backend infrastructure role focused on building
      platforms and APIs that support AI-driven systems, not on
      building, training, or deploying AI models directly. The
      engineer will orchestrate between AI agents and business
      logic, build backend services for experimentation, and
      design the cloud infrastructure that enables AI
      capabilities, making this a classic ai-support platform
      engineering role.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and evolve the backend architecture powering AI-driven acquisition systems
    with FastAPI and Python
  - Own cloud architecture in GCP/AWS/Digital Ocean with Infrastructure-as-Code and
    multi-environment production systems
  - Support orchestration between AI agents, business logic, and partner systems with
    clean abstraction layers
  - Build backend services enabling experimentation, optimization, and real-time decisioning
    and lead routing
  - Design clean APIs and abstraction layers over partner APIs for real-time booking,
    routing, and multi-channel engagement
  - Improve system resilience, monitoring, alerting, and failure recovery patterns
    across critical services
  - Set architectural standards, mentor engineers, and identify and eliminate system
    bottlenecks before they constrain growth
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered voice and messaging customer acquisition platform for home services
  - Real-time decisioning and lead routing to connect homeowners with service providers
  - Intelligent scheduling systems with partner API integrations
  - Compliance-aware dialing systems for customer engagement
  - Multi-channel engagement combining media, alerts, and brand solutions
  - Matching homeowners with right service providers through intelligent workflows
