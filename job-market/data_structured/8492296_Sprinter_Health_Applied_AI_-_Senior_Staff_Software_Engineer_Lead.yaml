    workflows
  - Develop production systems using LLMs, RAG, embeddings, and multi-agent architectures
  - Ship products like clinical visit summaries, patient risk models, and voice coordination
    assistants
  - Design workflow agents that automate scheduling, follow-ups, and operational tasks
  - Collaborate with product, clinical ops, and data partners to deliver measurable
    results
  - Help define the technical direction, tooling, and standards for a brand-new team
  use_cases:
  - Clinical visit summaries for patients and clinicians
  - Patient risk prediction models for proactive care
  - Voice coordination assistants for patient interactions
  - Workflow automation for scheduling and follow-ups
  - AI-powered clinical workflow optimization
  - Automated patient care coordination systems
