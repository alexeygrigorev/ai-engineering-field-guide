      The role is titled "Staff Software Engineer (AI)" and
      mentions building AI-powered applications, but the
      description focuses on using AI tooling/workflows and AI
      assistants rather than directly building, training, or fine-
      tuning models. The emphasis is on software architecture,
      event-driven systems, Python ecosystem, and cloud
      infrastructure, indicating this is a software engineering
      role that leverages AI tools rather than working directly on
      AI systems.

  - Build and scale AI-powered applications for the Catalyst team
  - Work closely with other engineers to develop and implement innovative solutions
  - Design and implement solutions for challenging software architecture problems
  - Integrate with external systems using messaging patterns and event-driven architectures
  - Participate in on-call rotation to ensure operational robustness
  - Mentor other engineers and share expertise through design discussions and documentation
  use_cases:
  - Accelerate clinical trial journey by reducing human effort with technology
  - Enable capture and re-use of research data from anywhere and anytime
  - Optimize clinical trial activities from recruitment to monitoring
  - Make it easier to design and deploy trials and enroll patients
  - Collect data and analyze clinical trial results
  - Improve clinical trial experience for patients, sites, and sponsors
