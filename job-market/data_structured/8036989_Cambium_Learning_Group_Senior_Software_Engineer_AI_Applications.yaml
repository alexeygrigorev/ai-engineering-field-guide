      This is a hands-on technical role focused on building and
      deploying AI systems. The responsibilities explicitly
      include designing autonomous AI agents, implementing agentic
      systems with tool calling and prompt optimization, building
      RAG pipelines, and integrating LLMs into products. This is
      not support work - the engineer is directly implementing the
      AI agents and generative capabilities.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and deploy robust Generative AI agents with persistent memory,
    shared state management, and complex multi-step reasoning workflows
  - Drive the development of cutting-edge AI-enabled web-based educational software
    systems
  - Incorporate Generative AI features into existing platforms with focus on performance
    optimization, UX, and safety compliance
  - Leverage Large Language Models and multimodal models to deliver context-aware
    user experiences
  - Establish and maintain frameworks for comprehensive agent evaluation, testing,
    safety assessments, and performance monitoring
  - Partner with cross-functional teams to translate user needs into scalable, production-ready
    agentic capabilities
  - Act as a technical mentor and subject matter expert on agent design patterns and
    LLM integration strategies
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered educational software systems for student learning and assessment
  - Autonomous AI agents for educational applications with multi-step reasoning
  - Computer-based essay grading using AI with accuracy exceeding human graders
  - Adaptive testing systems that customize exam experiences in real-time based on
    student responses
  - Large-scale online assessment platform serving millions of students and delivering
    actionable insights to educators
