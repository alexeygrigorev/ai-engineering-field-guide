    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role is primarily focused on building data
      infrastructure (data fabric, database systems, semantic
      modeling, knowledge graphs) that enables AI applications
      rather than directly building AI models themselves. While
      the role involves shaping AI strategy and working with ML/DL
      technologies, the core technical work is on distributed data
      systems, database architecture, and data integration layers
      that support AI workloads rather than training, fine-tuning,
      or deploying models.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build next generation data fabric system with semantic modeling, data
    catalog development, and data access layers
  - Drive innovation in database systems focusing on performance, correctness, durability,
    and scalability using AI technologies
  - Develop high performance distributed systems with key database concepts like concurrency
    control, consensus algorithms, replication, and view maintenance
  - Implement AI technologies including Text Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
    to improve product capabilities
  - Provide technical leadership and architectural guidance while shaping AI strategy
    for Grid Software business
  - Lead development of semantic modeling and knowledge graph technologies to enable
    AI-based applications
  use_cases:
  - Grid software for power utilities serving 40% of the world
  - Data fabric for next generation power grid management
  - Semantic data modeling for power transmission and distribution applications
  - Knowledge graph-based applications for energy grid operations
  - AI-based applications for distribution and transmission grid management
