position:
  title: AI Platform Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is an ai-first role because the engineer will directly
      architect and build an Agent Runtime, internal GenAI
      Client/SDKs, and AI reliability frameworks. The role
      involves implementing autonomous agents, prompt testing
      pipelines, and AI infrastructure - all hands-on work with AI
      systems rather than just supporting infrastructure for
      others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build production-grade Agent Runtime handling tool registration, permissions,
    timeouts, and retry semantics for autonomous agents
  - Evolve internal GenAI Client and SDKs to create standardized paved road for product
    engineers interacting with LLMs
  - Build reliability frameworks, golden datasets, and regression testing pipelines
    as CI/CD for AI deployment
  - Lead integration with external platforms via Model Context Protocol (MCP) and
    automation tools like n8n
  - Design guardrails, rate limits, and caching strategies for predictable and cost-effective
    AI infrastructure scaling
  - Establish internal standards for AI reliability and deterministic, high-quality
    AI feature delivery
  use_cases:
  - Automated accounting and financial flows that move at business speed
  - Real-time financial reporting and reconciliation
  - AI-powered finance operations with autonomous agent automation
  - Integration with external platforms via MCP for extended workflow automation
  - Deterministic AI features for financial platform users
