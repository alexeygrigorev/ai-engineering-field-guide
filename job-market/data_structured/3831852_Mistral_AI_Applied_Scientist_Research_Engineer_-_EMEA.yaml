      This role involves hands-on work building and deploying
      state-of-the-art AI models including pre-training, post-
      training, and deployment on GPU clusters. The candidate will
      work directly on models, agents, and RAG pipelines, not just
      supporting infrastructure or data pipelines for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Run pre-training, post-training and deploy state of the art models on clusters
    with thousands of GPUs
  - Generate and curate data for pre-training and post-training, working on evaluations
    to ensure model performance beats expectations
  - Develop tools and frameworks to facilitate data generation, model training, evaluation
    and deployment
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to tackle complex use cases using agents
    and RAG pipelines
  - Manage research projects and communications with client research teams
  - Develop SOTA models across different modalities such as text, image, and speech
  use_cases:
  - Deploying large-scale AI models on GPU clusters for enterprise applications
  - Implementing agents and RAG pipelines for complex customer use cases
  - Multi-modal AI applications spanning text, image, and speech processing
  - Client-facing research projects applying novel AI methods across diverse domains
  - Enterprise AI solutions through le Chat AI assistant for work and life
