      This role is directly building and deploying AI agents and
      ML models, including fine-tuning for financial workflows and
      transaction categorization. The hands-on work with
      autonomous agents, transformer-based architectures, and
      generative AI to automate financial processes clearly places
      this in the ai-first category.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and optimize autonomous AI agents leveraging generative AI to automate financial
    workflows from data ingestion to decision support
  - Design, train, evaluate, and deploy ML models for forecasting, predictive analysis,
    and transaction categorization
  - Construct and optimize data pipelines for raw, structured, and unstructured data
    ensuring high-quality inputs for models and AI agents
  - Incorporate advanced transformer-based architectures and embedding techniques
    to drive automation and enhance financial insights
  - Rigorously validate model performance, run data validation and diagnostics, and
    ensure flawless operations in production environments
  use_cases:
  - Automating the monthly financial close process for mid to large enterprises to
    reduce manual effort
  - AI-powered transaction categorization and classification for finance teams
  - Financial forecasting and predictive analytics using ML models
  - Extracting strategic insights from messy, unstructured financial data
  - Decision support systems for finance teams through autonomous AI agents
