position:
  title: Senior Engineer (Full Stack & AI/ML on GCP), AS
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      The role is primarily a full-stack engineering position
      focused on building applications on GCP. While it involves
      integrating AI/ML offerings (consuming APIs, working with
      models), the description emphasizes using AI services rather
      than building, training, or fine-tuning models. This falls
      under ai-support as the engineer is working NEAR AI by
      integrating AI capabilities into applications, not working
      directly ON AI/ML systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Contribute to architectural design and lead implementation of robust, scalable,
    and secure full-stack applications using Java Spring Boot, ReactJS/Angular, and
    Microservices
  - Design and implement cloud-native solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), utilizing
    services for compute, storage, networking, data analytics, and AI/ML
  - Drive the integration of AI/ML offerings into applications, from concept to deployment,
    working with models, APIs, and frameworks
  - Lead and contribute to full-stack development, including front-end (ReactJS/Angular)
    and back-end (Java Spring Boot) components, REST APIs, and data models
  - Provide technical guidance and mentorship to junior engineers, fostering innovation,
    continuous learning, and excellence
  - Champion clean, secure, and efficient code practices, ensuring adherence to industry
    standards, security, and performance optimization
  - Partner with cross-functional and global teams to translate business requirements
    into technical solutions and solve complex software problems
  - Contribute to and improve CI/CD pipelines and deployment strategies, promoting
    automation and efficiency
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise-level full-stack applications for banking and financial services
  - Cloud-native solutions leveraging GCP services for compute, storage, networking,
    and data analytics
  - AI/ML-enabled applications through integration of pre-built AI services and APIs
  - Microservices-based architecture with API gateways for scalable banking solutions
  - Data-driven applications utilizing BigQuery and data pipelines for business intelligence
