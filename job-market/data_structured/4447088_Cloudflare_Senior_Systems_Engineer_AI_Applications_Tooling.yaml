  - Drive cross-functional efforts to integrate AI into Cloudflare's developer platform,
    ensuring optimal scalability and efficiency
  - Mentor and champion best practices, engaging with the broader AI and developer
    community, contributing to open-source projects, technical documentation, and
    blog posts
  - Work across Cloudflare's ecosystem to identify and evaluate new AI opportunities,
    influence technical direction, and drive adoption of AI technologies
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered code generation and debugging tools for developers
  - AI observability platform for model monitoring and explainability
  - Edge-optimized model inference for low-latency AI applications
  - Autonomous intelligent agents for developer automation
  - AI-powered developer platform integrations
