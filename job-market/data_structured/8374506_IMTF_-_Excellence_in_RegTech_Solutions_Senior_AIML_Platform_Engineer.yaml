    data pipelines (Spark)
  - Drive the evolution of architecture and technology stack, ensuring scalability,
    performance, reliability and security at ISO 27001 level
  - Support the deployment, monitoring, and optimization of models in complex and
    varied production environments, including air-gapped scenarios with or without
    GPU availability
