      This is a Staff Backend Engineer role building
      infrastructure and backend services that power AI
      capabilities, not building AI models or agents themselves.
      The responsibilities focus on architecting distributed
      systems, APIs, data pipelines, and infrastructure for LLM
      integrations and vector search to enable intelligent agents
      built by others.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect distributed systems that power AI agent orchestration, handling complex
    multi-step workflows with reliability and observability
  - Design and implement core backend services in Golang for high-performance concurrent
    operations and Python for AI/ML integrations
  - Build robust APIs and service interfaces that abstract AI capabilities for consumption
    by multiple clients and internal systems
  - Own the technical roadmap for backend infrastructure supporting LLM integrations,
    vector search, and real-time data processing
  - Establish architectural patterns and standards for service design, data modeling,
    and inter-service communication
  - Drive system scalability and reliability, implementing caching strategies, database
    optimization, and async processing patterns
  - Build data pipelines that process equity data, embeddings, and user interactions
    to continuously improve AI model performance
  - Mentor engineers on backend best practices, system design, and technical decision-making
  use_cases:
  - Automate complex equity workflows using intelligent agents
  - Enable AI-native equity and business management for early-stage companies
  - Process and analyze equity data using embeddings and vector search
  - Provide real-time data processing for AI-powered cap table management
  - Orchestrate multi-step AI workflows for equity optimization and management
