    domains
  - Lead structured workshops to define process landscapes using design thinking and
    process modeling

  - Architect end-to-end agentic workflows including data ingestion, match logic,
    exception handling, and reconciliation
  - Manage and mentor a team of engineers while overseeing project execution, timelines,
    and resource allocation
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams including AI engineers, product managers,
    enterprise architects, and business stakeholders

  - Agentic AI workflow automation for enterprise business processes
  - Cross-functional AI solution deployment across enterprise systems
  - Process transformation and optimization through AI agent orchestration
  - Enterprise-wide AI initiatives with measurable business impact
  - Integration of AI capabilities with enterprise systems like SAP, Salesforce, and
