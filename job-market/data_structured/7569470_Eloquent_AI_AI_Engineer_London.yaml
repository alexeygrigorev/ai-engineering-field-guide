      This is primarily a full-stack software engineering role
      building the applications and infrastructure that power AI
      workflows, not directly working on models, agents, or AI
      systems themselves. The engineer collaborates with AI
      researchers/ML engineers to integrate LLMs and RAG into
      production applications, but the core work involves front-
      end interfaces, backend services, and cloud infrastructure
      that support AI interactions rather than building, training,
      or deploying models.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build full-stack applications that power AI-driven workflows for enterprise
    users
  - Develop high-performance front-end interfaces for AI agent control, monitoring,
    and visualization
  - Build scalable backend services that support real-time AI interactions, knowledge
    retrieval, and automation
  - Optimize AI-powered UIs to ensure seamless and intuitive user experiences
  - Work closely with AI researchers and ML engineers to integrate LLMs, RAG, and
    automation into production-ready applications
  - Ship robust, minimal-dependency code that performs efficiently in enterprise environments
  - Continuously iterate and refine AI-driven products, balancing user needs with
    technical feasibility
  use_cases:
  - Automating compliance reviews for financial institutions and insurers
  - Handling customer operations with intelligent, end-to-end execution
  - Replacing repetitive manual tasks with AI-powered automation in regulated environments
  - Executing complex workflows across fragmented tools with human-level precision
  - Transforming how millions of people manage their finances through AI-driven automation
