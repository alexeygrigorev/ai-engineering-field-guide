    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role is directly building and deploying AI/ML systems -
      specifically multi-agent LLM systems with real-time text and
      voice capabilities. The engineer will own the core "brain"
      service, implementing RAG, agent orchestration, prompt
      optimization with DSPy, and LLM reasoning patterns.
  responsibilities:
  - Own and evolve the core brain service powering Qu including architecture, SLAs,
    latency budgets, and rollouts
  - Build low-latency real-time text and voice communication systems with streaming,
    VAD, and interruption handling
  - Design and implement multi-agent orchestration systems using planner-executor-critic
    patterns with role routing and tool coordination
  - Implement reasoning frameworks including ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, and Tree/Graph-of-Thoughts
    optimization patterns
  - Develop programmatic prompt optimization using DSPy, MiPRO, and GEPA for iterative
    prompt evolution under evaluation constraints
  - Engineer RAG systems with hybrid search, re-ranking, query rewriting, and evaluate
    faithfulness, context precision/recall metrics
  - Build comprehensive evaluation and observability systems with OpenTelemetry tracing,
    automated evals, regression testing, and CI/CD gates for production LLM systems
  use_cases:
  - Real-time clinical AI assistant that provides text and voice support for healthcare
    professionals across the care continuum
  - Multi-agent system for handling clinical tasks through coordinated planning, execution,
    and critic patterns
  - RAG-powered system for retrieving and synthesizing medical knowledge with strong
    grounding and faithfulness guarantees
  - Voice-enabled interactive system with turn-taking, interruption handling, and
    sub-2-second response latency for clinical workflows
  - EHR integration system that transforms healthcare data into LLM-accessible tools
    for clinical decision support
