  name: Adaptive ML
  stage: Seed
  focus: RLOps platform for LLM specialization and deployment
position:
  title: AI Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work specializing LLMs for
      production deployment using reinforcement learning and
      building synthetic data pipelines. The engineer directly
      experiments with model personalization and productionizes
      frontier AI research, which is core AI development work
      rather than just support or infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Embed directly with enterprise customers to help maximize the value of their Adaptive
    Engine deployment
  - Experiment with pipelines to personalize models at scale, leveraging synthetic
    data and production feedback
  - Ensure customer success by owning problems end-to-end from ideation to deployment,
    validation, and production
  - Work closely with research staff to productionize the latest frontier AI research
    initiatives
  - Contribute to the product roadmap by identifying promising trends and customer
    needs
  - Report clearly on work to a distributed collaborative team with a focus on asynchronous
    written communication
  use_cases:
  - Specializing and deploying large language models into production environments
    for enterprises
  - Building synthetic data pipelines to bootstrap models and enable continuous improvement
    from production feedback
  - Optimizing task-specific LLM development for measurable business impact and ROI
  - Running production-ready workflows that serve millions of requests while optimizing
    cost and performance
  - Helping customers bridge the gap from proof-of-concept to production for generative
    AI projects
