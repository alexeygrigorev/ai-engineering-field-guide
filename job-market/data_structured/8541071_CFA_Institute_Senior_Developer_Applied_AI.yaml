      This role involves hands-on building and implementation of
      generative AI solutions including RAG patterns, agentic
      workflows, tool/function calling, and prompt orchestration.
      The developer is directly working ON AI systems -
      implementing retrieval augmented generation, building agent
      workflows, and establishing evaluation frameworks for AI
      applications, not just supporting infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and unit test end-to-end AI-enabled software solutions following
    standard software development lifecycle practices
  - Rapidly prototype AI capabilities from concept to demonstrable proof of value,
    including UI/API layers, orchestration, retrieval, and evaluation
  - Implement retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and enterprise search patterns,
    including connectors, chunking strategies, embeddings, access control, relevance
    tuning, and grounding/citation techniques
  - Build and orchestrate agentic workflows using tool/function calling, workflow
    orchestration, guardrails, observability, and error handling
  - Establish evaluation frameworks, including test datasets, golden answers, regression
    testing, hallucination detection, safety checks, and light red teaming
  - Package successful outcomes into reusable assets such as reference implementations,
    templates, prompt/tool patterns, and operational runbooks
  - Partner with subject matter experts and business stakeholders to define success
    criteria, ROI signals, and iterate on solutions
  - Transition production ready concepts to engineering and platform teams with clear
    requirements, architecture documentation, risks, and operational considerations
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise search and information retrieval for investment professionals
  - AI-powered education and learning systems for investment credentialing
  - Document analysis and knowledge extraction from financial content
  - Agentic workflows for research and analysis tasks
  - Generative AI applications for investment and finance education
