      This role focuses on integrating AI models via APIs/SDKs
      into cloud-native applications rather than building or fine-
      tuning models. The engineer works on full stack development,
      system architecture, and enabling AI features through
      integration patterns - supporting the AI work rather than
      directly working on the AI systems themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Build full stack features using React, Python, and modern APIs to deliver high-quality
    user experiences
  - Design and extend backend services and APIs that integrate AI models and external
    AI services into the platform
  - Define patterns and best practices for integrating LLMs and semantic modeling
    into data workflows
  - Create intuitive user workflows that incorporate AI such as conversational data
    querying, assisted discovery, or guided analytics
  - Mentor and guide engineers, raising the bar on engineering craft, AI integration
    strategies, and system reliability
  - Ensure reliability at scale by driving observability, automated testing, CI/CD
    improvements, and performance tuning across AI-enabled systems
  - Shape the app marketplace experience by advancing intelligent recommendations,
    AI-assisted publishing, and cross-app insights
  - Partner with product and design leadership to translate ambiguous AI opportunities
    into customer-ready features
  use_cases:
  - Conversational data querying allowing users to ask natural language questions
    about their data
  - Intelligent recommendations for data apps and cross-app insights within the marketplace
  - AI-assisted publishing workflow that helps providers create and deploy data applications
  - Guided analytics and assisted discovery to help users find relevant data and insights
  - Semantic modeling integration for understanding and relating data across applications
