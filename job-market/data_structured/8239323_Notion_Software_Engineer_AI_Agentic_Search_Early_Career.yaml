    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves building infrastructure, connectors, and
      systems that enable AI agentic search (data pipelines,
      vector storage, ranking systems) but does not mention
      building, training, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models
      themselves. The engineer works ON the systems that support
      AI functionality rather than directly on the models.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and ship connectors from scratch, keeping third-party data continuously
    in sync
  - Build semantic search infrastructure powered by vector embeddings and efficient
    storage systems
  - Transform natural language questions into intelligent queries across multiple
    data sources
  - Implement ranking systems that surface relevant results while respecting user
    permissions and access controls
  - Scale systems to handle millions of documents across thousands of customers
  - Collaborate with cross-functional partners to drive product strategy and execution
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise search across multiple applications (Slack, Google Drive, Salesforce,
    GitHub)
  - Semantic search powered by vector embeddings
  - Natural language query transformation for multi-source search
  - Permission-aware ranking and result surfacing
  - Large-scale document synchronization and indexing
