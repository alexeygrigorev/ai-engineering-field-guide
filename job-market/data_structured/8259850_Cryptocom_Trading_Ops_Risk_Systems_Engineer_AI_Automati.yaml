    automated commentary generation
  - Develop real-time AI-driven risk models using machine learning to predict market
    volatility and alert on cross-market risks
  - Build and maintain sophisticated risk reporting dashboards for the trading desk
  - Ensure data integrity across trading systems, middle-office platforms, and downstream
    finance ledgers
  - Leverage LLMs and advanced scripting to automate legacy manual processes and improve
    predictive risk modeling
