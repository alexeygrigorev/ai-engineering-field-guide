    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a Full Stack Software Engineer role focused on
      building web applications, APIs, and visualization tools
      that support AI security researchers rather than directly
      working on AI/ML models. The role involves translating ML
      models into software tools and creating dashboards for AI
      systems, which positions it as enabling infrastructure for
      AI work rather than building, training, or deploying models.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build complete product features from persistent data storage and high-throughput
    APIs to polished front-end interfaces
  - Spearhead system architecture for new components, ensuring resilience, maintainability,
    and horizontal scalability under enterprise loads
  - Collaborate with AI Security Researchers to translate cryptographic primitives
    and machine learning models into robust, documented software tools
  - Develop sophisticated visualization tools and dashboards that reveal the complex
    vulnerability surfaces of advanced AI and ML systems
  - Rapidly iterate on prototypes and scale core applications to ensure high availability
    for low-latency AI security use cases
  use_cases:
  - AI security testing and vulnerability assessment for advanced AI systems
  - Visualization of complex vulnerability surfaces in AI and ML systems
  - Low-latency security analysis for AI models and systems
  - Translation of cryptographic primitives and ML models into deployable software
    tools
  - Enterprise-scale AI security monitoring and protection
