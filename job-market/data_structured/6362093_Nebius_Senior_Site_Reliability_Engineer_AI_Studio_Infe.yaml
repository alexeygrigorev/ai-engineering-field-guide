    reasoning: |-
      This is an SRE role focused on infrastructure reliability,
      observability, and platform engineering for an AI inference
      platform. The work involves Kubernetes, telemetry pipelines,
      and infrastructure-as-code rather than building, training,
      or fine-tuning models directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and refine telemetry pipelines including metrics, logs, and traces for
    observability
  - Tune Kubernetes autoscalers to maximize GPU efficiency and performance
  - Create Terraform modules that build resilience into every new cluster deployment
  - Harden request-routing and retry logic to handle transient failures
  - Build automation and runbooks for rapid incident detection and remediation
  - Drive post-mortem culture to prevent recurring issues and improve system reliability
  - Scale the inference platform while meeting aggressive cost and reliability targets
  use_cases:
  - Deploying foundation models including text, vision, audio, and multimodal architectures
    at scale
  - Providing fast, reliable, and effortless model inference serving platform
  - Enabling massive GPU cloud infrastructure for AI/ML workloads
  - Handling high-throughput API requests for model inference
  - Supporting GPU-heavy workloads through accelerator stacks like vLLM, Triton, and
    Ray
