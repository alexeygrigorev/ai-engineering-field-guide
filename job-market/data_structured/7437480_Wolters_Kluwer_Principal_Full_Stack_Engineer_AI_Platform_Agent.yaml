  title: Principal Full Stack Engineer, AI Platform & Agents (US/Canada Hybrid/Remote)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role requires hands-on development of AI agents using
      LangChain/LangGraph, implementing LLM patterns like RAG and
      tool-use, and building full-stack applications for AI agent
      deployment. The engineer directly develops and ships AI
      agents (not just infrastructure or tooling for others) and
      applies GenAI patterns to deliver measurable customer value.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement full-stack applications, AI agents, and platform components
    enabling rapid GenAI agent development, validation, and deployment
  - Build developer tooling, CI/CD, and observability systems for safe, fast iteration
    including evals, canaries, and telemetry
  - Apply LLM patterns including RAG, retrieval, routing, and tool-use to deliver
    measurable customer value with improved reliability and safety
  - Implement secure SDLC and privacy-by-design practices with threat modeling and
    least privilege access
  - Collaborate with product, UX, and domain experts to deliver customer-focused solutions
    with measurable outcomes
  - Lead by example through hands-on engineering, architecture decisions, and mentoring
    less experienced engineers
  use_cases:
  - 'UpToDate Expert AI: Medical research and clinical reasoning agent that accelerates
    differential diagnosis and refines treatment decisions for physicians'
  - 'Healthcare decision support: Real-time medical assistant reducing cognitive load
    while maintaining safety, privacy, and guideline fidelity'
  - Platform serving 20+ AI agents across multiple domains with more in development
  - Rapid agent development and deployment platform enabling hundreds of product teams
    across healthcare, legal, tax, and compliance industries
  - GenAI-powered solutions improving time-to-decision and trust/safety metrics in
    critical professional domains
