    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on building, prototyping, and
      deploying agentic AI systems using LangChain/LangGraph,
      multi-agent frameworks, and LLMs. The engineer directly
      works with models for perception, language understanding,
      reasoning, and decision-making, which is core AI/ML
      development rather than support work.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, prototype, and develop multi-agent systems using frameworks like AgentSDK
    and LangChain/LangGraph for autonomous, context-aware interactions
  - Leverage advanced GenAI models including reasoning models and real-time voice
    API to build agentic prototypes and deploy product-level agentic skills to users
  - Develop perception and language understanding, deep reasoning, and reinforcement
    learning systems for AI agent decision-making
  - Deploy models to Zillow's highly scalable infrastructure platforms handling hundreds
    of millions of daily interactions
  - Mentor and guide engineers in using the right technologies for agentic AI solutions
    and foster a culture of innovation
  - Drive applied science projects, aligning on timelines and prioritization for A/B
    testing and production rollouts

  - Always-on AI assistant for home shopping and transaction experience
  - Context-rich dialogue systems for long conversations and multi-step reasoning
  - AI-powered tools for home buyers to find their next home
  - Specialized assistants empowering real estate professionals with domain expertise
  - Decision-making agents for real estate navigation and transactions
