    model gateways
  - Integrate deep learning and data systems combining structured stats, tracking
    data, and video-derived features
  - Build APIs and UI layers exposing insights to coaches, teams, and partners
  - Explore novel sports analytics tools using LLMs, retrieval, and deterministic
    logic
