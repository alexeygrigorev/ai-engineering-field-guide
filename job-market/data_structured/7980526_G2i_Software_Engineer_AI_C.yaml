      This is an RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)
      role where engineers review, rank, and edit AI-generated
      code to provide feedback signals. The work involves
      evaluating model outputs rather than building, training,
      fine-tuning, or deploying models directly, placing it in the
      support category.
  responsibilities:
  - Compare and rank multiple code snippets, explaining which is best and why
  - Repair and refactor AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and style
  - Inject feedback including ratings, edits, and test results into the RLHF pipeline
  - Provide detailed justifications for code review decisions to help models learn
  - Identify logic errors, performance traps, and security issues in code
  - Maintain smooth operation of the RLHF feedback pipeline
  use_cases:
  - Training LLMs to write production-grade code across multiple programming languages
  - Teaching models to propose, critique, and improve code through expert feedback
  - Converting human code reviews into reward signals for reinforcement learning
  - Generating code that meets production standards for correctness and efficiency
  - Developing AI systems that can self-critique and improve code quality
