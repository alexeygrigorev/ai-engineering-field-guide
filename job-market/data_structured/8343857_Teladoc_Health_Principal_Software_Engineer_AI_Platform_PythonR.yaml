    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is an AI Platform role focused on building
      infrastructure and platforms that enable AI work rather than
      directly implementing AI/ML models. The role involves
      backend/frontend development, CI/CD pipelines, and platform
      engineering with only optional exposure to model inference
      APIs as a bonus qualification.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead technical design for platform features and services, breaking ambiguous requirements
    into clear, incremental designs and stories
  - Implement backend services in Python/FastAPI and React frontends end-to-end, owning
    features from idea to production
  - Define clear API contracts and data flows between services and UIs, creating patterns
    and templates for others to follow
  - Champion high-quality engineering practices including code reviews, documentation,
    and maintainable, testable designs
  - Establish and evolve automated testing approaches (unit, integration, end-to-end)
    and CI/CD pipelines for frequent deployments
  - Own the operational lifecycle of features and services including monitoring, observability,
    on-call participation, and incident response
  - Design and implement secure-by-default solutions with robust authentication/authorization
    and safe handling of sensitive data
  - Provide hands-on technical leadership and mentorship to engineers through pairing,
    design discussions, and feedback
  use_cases:
  - Building developer platforms that serve multiple product teams in a healthcare
    organization
  - Enabling AI/ML capabilities through platform infrastructure for virtual care applications
  - Supporting data-intensive applications with robust backend services and data pipelines
  - Facilitating integration with model inference APIs for healthcare AI solutions
  - Providing secure, scalable platform services for telehealth and virtual care delivery
