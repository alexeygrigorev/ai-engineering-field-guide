  title: AI/ML Engineer - JAVA and Microservices and  AI/ML
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work building, training, and
      optimizing both traditional ML models and generative AI
      models. Responsibilities include model development, fine-
      tuning, prompt engineering, and inference optimization,
      which directly involve working ON AI systems rather than
      just supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, train, and evaluate machine learning, deep learning, and generative
    AI models to solve business problems
  - Build and optimize GenAI solutions, including prompt engineering, fine-tuning,
    model optimization, and inference performance improvements
  - Run proof-of-concepts and experiments, baseline results, and compare models against
    production or reference systems
  - Prepare, clean, validate, and manage structured and unstructured data used for
    training and inference
  - Develop APIs and services (REST, FastAPI) to expose ML and GenAI capabilities
    to applications
  - Containerize and deploy AI services using Docker and cloud-native services
  - Partner with data engineering and business teams to understand the problem space
    and required datasets
  - Ensure proper handling of sensitive data (PII/PHI) in accordance with governance
    and compliance standards
  use_cases:
  - Healthcare outcome prediction and optimization
  - Business problem solving using ML and deep learning techniques
  - Classification, regression, and clustering for healthcare data analysis
  - GenAI-powered applications for healthcare services
  - Data-driven insights for health management and care delivery
