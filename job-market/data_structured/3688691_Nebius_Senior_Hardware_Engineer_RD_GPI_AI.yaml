      This is a hardware engineering role focused on GPU server
      infrastructure and high-performance cloud systems for AI
      workloads. The role involves deploying, maintaining,
      troubleshooting, and benchmarking hardware systems (GPUs,
      InfiniBand, NVLink, PCIe) but does not involve building,
      training, fine-tuning, or deploying AI models or ML
      algorithms. The position supports AI workloads by optimizing
      the underlying hardware infrastructure that enables others
      to run AI/ML systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Participate in the design, deployment, and maintenance of high-performance cloud
    systems tailored for AI workloads
  - Arrange and perform hardware R&D tests and experiments on site in data center
  - Troubleshoot and resolve complex system issues related to GPUs, networking (InfiniBand,
    NVLink), PCIe, and server infrastructure
  - Conduct deep investigations into hardware, software, and networking problems to
    ensure optimal system performance and reliability
  - Participate in development of tests and test methodologies for advanced GPU, InfiniBand,
    and Compute systems to benchmark and validate performance
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to improve system performance and reliability
  - Monitor system performance and continuously fine-tune configurations for maximum
    efficiency
  use_cases:
  - High-performance GPU-based cloud infrastructure for AI workloads
  - AI/ML model training and inference on optimized server hardware
  - High-performance computing systems with GPU clusters
  - Cloud-based AI infrastructure reducing infrastructure costs for customers
