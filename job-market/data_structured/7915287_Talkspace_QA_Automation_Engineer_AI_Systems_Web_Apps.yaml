    reasoning: |-
      This is a QA Automation Engineer role focused on testing and
      validating AI/LLM-powered systems rather than building,
      training, or deploying models. The role develops test
      harnesses, validation frameworks, and regression testing for
      agentic workflows, which supports the AI development team's
      work but does not involve hands-on model engineering.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and maintain automated test scripts for web apps, mobile apps, APIs, and
    LLM-driven features
  - Build automation frameworks for testing agentic and multi-step workflows
  - Create evaluation harnesses for LLM outputs including structured output validation
    and model regression testing
  - Execute manual and exploratory testing to validate new features and identify defects
  - Collaborate with engineering and data science to validate safety layers and fallback
    mechanisms
  - Design and maintain comprehensive test plans and test cases for AI-specific workflows
  use_cases:
  - Agentic workflow validation for mental health support systems
  - Structured output validation for LLM-powered therapy features
  - Safety layer and fallback mechanism testing for AI interactions
  - Regression testing for model behavior changes in clinical systems
  - Multi-step workflow testing for conversational AI interfaces
