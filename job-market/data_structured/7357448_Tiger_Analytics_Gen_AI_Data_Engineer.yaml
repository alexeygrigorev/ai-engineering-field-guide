      This is a data engineering role focused on building the
      infrastructure, pipelines, and platforms that support
      GenAI/RAG systems. The role involves data ingestion, vector
      databases, knowledge graphs, and document indexing for RAG
      solutions, but does not include building, training, fine-
      tuning, or deploying the actual AI models.
  responsibilities:
  - Build robust data pipelines for document ingestion, indexing, and retrieval to
    support scalable RAG solutions
  - Architect data platforms capable of processing petabytes of data with real-time
    and batch ingestion
  - Design and manage infrastructure for optimal extraction, transformation, and loading
    from various data sources
  - Integrate external databases, APIs, and knowledge graphs into RAG systems to improve
    contextualization
  - Conduct experiments to evaluate RAG workflow effectiveness and iterate for optimal
    performance
  - Curate and collect data from traditional and non-traditional sources for AI applications
  use_cases:
  - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for enterprise knowledge management
  - Vector search and information retrieval for document-based AI applications
  - Knowledge graph integration for enhanced AI contextualization
  - Large-scale document processing and indexing for enterprise search
  - Unstructured data management (text, audio, video, images) for AI workflows
