      This is a hands-on AI engineering role focused on building
      AI agents that handle financial conversations. The role
      involves directly working with LLMs, prompt engineering,
      orchestration, model routing, and voice AI systems - all
      core AI/ML development tasks rather than supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design the agentic runtime that powers natural, multi-turn conversations while
    executing complex business logic
  - Build primitives that balance conversational fluidity with structured reasoning
    for human-like agent interactions
  - Create context management systems that track consumer state, conversation history,
    and business rules across long dialogues
  - Architect real-time voice pipeline for sub-1s latency across transcription, reasoning,
    and synthesis
  - Design prompting, orchestration, and model routing strategies for LLM infrastructure
  - Build evaluation frameworks that measure agent quality beyond accuracy including
    conversation quality, empathy, and compliance
  - Set architectural direction for proAgent platform and mentor engineers on engineering
    practices
  - Partner with Product and Client teams to translate customer problems into technical
    roadmaps
  use_cases:
  - AI agents for loan servicing and collections
  - Handling nuanced financial conversations with payment negotiations
  - Real-time voice agents for consumer finance interactions
  - Compliance-driven customer engagement with objection handling
  - Millions of daily live consumer conversations with automated reasoning
