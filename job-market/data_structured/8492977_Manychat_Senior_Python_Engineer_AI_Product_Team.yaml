  - Integrate LLM providers with focus on reliability, latency, and cost-efficiency
  - Architect scalable, async Python services operating in high-load production environments
  - Design and maintain internal and external APIs ensuring scalability and resilience
  - Ensure production reliability through strong observability practices including
    monitoring, logging, and alerting
  - Collaborate cross-functionally with Product, Design, AI experts, and Platform
    teams
