    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves directly building observability foundation
      models, autonomous agents for SRE, and production code
      repair agents. Responsibilities include implementing models,
      running distributed training with Ray, and deploying ML
      inference systems at scale - all hands-on work with AI/ML
      systems rather than just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and operate datasets, training and evaluation pipelines, benchmarks, and
    internal tooling
  - Implement models, run experiments at scale, and profile for reliability, performance,
    and cost
  - Orchestrate distributed training and distributed RL with Ray, including scheduling,
    scaling, and failure recovery
  - Make the research stack observable, reproducible, and easier to use
  - Establish rigorous automated benchmarks and regression tests for forecasting,
    anomaly detection, multi-modal analysis, agents, and code repair tasks
  - Collaborate with Research Scientists, Product, and Engineering to integrate advanced
    AI capabilities into Datadog's product ecosystem and to harden prototypes into
    reliable services
  - Contribute high-quality code, documentation, and open-source artifacts that enable
    the community and internal teams to reproduce, extend, and evaluate results
  use_cases:
  - Advanced forecasting and anomaly detection for cloud observability using foundation
    models
  - Multi-modal telemetry analysis of logs, metrics, and traces
  - Autonomous SRE agents that automatically detect, diagnose, and resolve production
    incidents
  - Production code repair agents that identify and fix performance issues and security
    vulnerabilities
  - Multi-step planning and reasoning for incident resolution in production environments
