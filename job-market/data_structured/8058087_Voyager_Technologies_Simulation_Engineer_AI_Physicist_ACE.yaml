      This role involves building, deploying, and maintaining
      production-ready AI agents using frameworks like LangGraph
      and Agent Development Kits. The engineer will work directly
      on implementing agentic systems with prompts, tool schemas,
      and decision-making loops, not just supporting
      infrastructure for others who work on AI.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, implement, and deploy production-ready AI agents using frameworks such
    as LangGraph or Agent Development Kits
  - Define clear agent roles, goals, and capabilities including prompts, tool schemas,
    and decision-making loops
  - Develop and maintain Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that expose Voyager's
    internal systems to agents
  - Integrate external and internal engineering tools as robust, secure agent tools
  - Build evaluation suites and benchmarks that measure agent performance on realistic
    engineering tasks
  - Collaborate with domain experts to encode manufacturing, test, and safety constraints
    into agent behavior
  - Use LLMs as a development accelerator for scaffolding code, writing tests, and
    generating documentation
  use_cases:
  - Thermal analysis agents that simulate and optimize thermal characteristics of
    hardware designs
  - Supply-chain scouting agents that identify and evaluate components and materials
  - G-code validation agents that verify manufacturing instructions for CNC machines
  - Design for Manufacturing (DfM) automation to embed manufacturability constraints
    early in design
  - Physics simulation integration to test designs against real-world physical constraints
  - CAD and PCB routing automation to accelerate hardware development cycles
