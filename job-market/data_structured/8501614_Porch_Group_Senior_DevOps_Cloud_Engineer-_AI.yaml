    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      The role focuses on integrating AI-powered tools into DevOps
      workflows and supporting AI/ML platforms rather than
      building, training, or deploying models. The engineer works
      on infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and observability
      systems that leverage AI insights for predictive monitoring,
      anomaly detection, and auto-remediation, which is enabling
      work for AI systems rather than direct AI development.
  responsibilities:
  - Build infrastructure/systems that balance operational excellence, security, reliability,
    performance efficiency, and cost optimization
  - Improve system observability using infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, and
    infrastructure automation to anticipate and address issues before they become
    critical
  - Integrate AI-powered tools into DevOps workflows for predictive monitoring, anomaly
    detection, intelligent alerting, and auto-remediation
  - Leverage AI/ML insights to optimize CI/CD pipelines, deployment strategies, infrastructure
    performance, and cost
  - Build and maintain self-healing systems using AI-based observability platforms
  - Implement Infrastructure as Code using Terraform and provide 24x7x365 monitoring,
    incident response, and on-call support
  use_cases:
  - Predictive monitoring for infrastructure and application health
  - Anomaly detection and intelligent alerting for DevOps operations
  - Auto-remediation of infrastructure issues using AI-based observability
  - Self-healing cloud infrastructure systems
  - Optimized CI/CD pipeline performance and reliability
