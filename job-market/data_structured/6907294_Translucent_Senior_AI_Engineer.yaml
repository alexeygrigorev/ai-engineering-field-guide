    success, and RAG context metrics
  - Implement prompt and tool versioning with experiment tracking and rollback capabilities
  - Build guardrails including schema-validated outputs, PII redaction, auth scopes,
    and circuit breakers
  - Drive RAG quality through chunking strategies, hybrid search, document attribution,
    and retriever evaluation
  - Manage cost and latency through caching, streaming, model routing, and token accounting
