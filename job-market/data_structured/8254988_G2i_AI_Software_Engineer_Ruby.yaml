  focus: LLM code evaluation and training via RLHF
position:
  title: AI Software Engineer (Ruby)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves providing human feedback for RLHF -
      ranking, editing, and critiquing AI-generated code rather
      than building, training, or deploying models. The work
      supports model training through feedback injection but does
      not involve hands-on model engineering.
  responsibilities:
  - Compare and rank multiple code snippets while explaining which is best and why
  - Repair and refactor AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and style
  - Inject feedback including ratings, edits, and test results into the RLHF pipeline
  - Maintain smooth operation of the RLHF feedback pipeline
  - Identify logic errors, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities in code
  use_cases:
  - Training large language models to write production-grade Ruby code
  - Generating and improving code proposals through reinforcement learning
  - Converting human expert feedback into reward signals for model tuning
  - Teaching models to critique and improve code like expert engineers
