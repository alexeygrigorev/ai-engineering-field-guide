  title: Software Engineer, AI (Python)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves direct work with large-language models
      through RLHF pipeline, providing code rankings, edits, and
      feedback to train the model. The engineer is actively
      participating in the model training process by generating
      reward signals from code evaluations, which is directly
      working ON AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Compare and rank multiple code snippets with explanations of which is best and
    why
  - Repair and refactor AI-generated code for correctness, efficiency, and style
  - Inject feedback including ratings, edits, and test results into the RLHF pipeline
  - Maintain smooth operation of the RLHF pipeline for continuous model improvement
  - Identify logic errors, performance traps, and security issues in AI-generated
    code
  - Provide clear written justifications for code evaluations to generate training
    signals
  use_cases:
  - Training large-language models to write production-grade code across multiple
    programming languages
  - RLHF pipeline for code generation and improvement
  - Converting human code feedback into reward signals for reinforcement learning
  - Automated code repair and refactoring
  - Code quality evaluation and ranking at scale
