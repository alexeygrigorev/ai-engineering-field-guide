  title: AI Engineer

    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work building, deploying, and
      optimizing autonomous agents and LLM-based systems. The
      engineer will directly work on LLMs, agentic frameworks,
      fine-tuning, RAG, and production deployment of models, which
      clearly qualifies as working directly ON AI systems rather
      than supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Drive applied research into LLMs and agentic systems, rapidly prototyping, validating,
    and shipping production-ready capabilities
  - Stay hands-on with the latest advances in foundation models, LLM-as-a-judge, agentic
    frameworks & tools (e.g. MCP), and move fast to bring them into the product
  - Build an evals framework in collaboration with legal experts to assess agent performance
  - Develop a hypervisor system that governs every step of the agentic system and
    validates agent behavior
  - Build alignment programs for legal AI systems to ensure agents operate within
    defined guardrails
  - Collaborate cross-functionally with product, design, and commercial teams to ship
    real AI into production
  - Improve the intelligence and autonomy of agents by leveraging emerging technologies
    and legal expertise
  use_cases:
  - Automating repetitive legal workflows for enterprise teams with 100,000+ employees
  - Deploying autonomous agents that work 24/7 under supervision and within customer-defined
    guardrails
  - Routing only exceptional cases to legal professionals for review while handling
    routine work automatically
  - Providing transparent and auditable logs of all agent requests and actions for
    full visibility
  - Handling legal tasks that were previously impossible to solve through automation
