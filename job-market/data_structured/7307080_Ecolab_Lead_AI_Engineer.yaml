      This role involves hands-on building and deployment of
      agentic AI systems using Microsoft AI Foundry, designing
      agents that autonomously orchestrate workflows, and working
      with LLM-based platforms. While it includes leadership
      responsibilities, the core work is directly developing AI
      agents and models (building/optimizing ML models, RAG
      systems with vector databases), not just supporting
      infrastructure or data pipelines for other AI teams.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and lead development of scalable, production-grade agentic AI systems
  - Design serverless, event-driven workflows using Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and
    Power Automate
  - Build and optimize ML models for predictive analytics, anomaly detection, and
    recommendations
  - Integrate agents with enterprise platforms such as SAP HANA, Salesforce, Snowflake,
    Kafka, and UiPath
  - Leverage Microsoft AI Foundry to build and deploy agents that meet enterprise-grade
    standards
  - Mentor and coach junior engineers, fostering a culture of innovation and technical
    excellence
  - Define and enforce architecture patterns, reusable components, and governance
    standards
  use_cases:
  - Autonomous workflow orchestration across enterprise operations
  - Real-time data analysis and embedded decision-making in finance, sales, and operations
  - Predictive analytics and anomaly detection for operational insights
  - Recommendation systems for business process optimization
  - Vision-based and IoT-enabled agent applications at the edge
  - Integration with enterprise systems like SAP and Salesforce for automated business
