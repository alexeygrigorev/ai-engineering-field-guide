      This role involves hands-on work building AI/ML systems -
      specifically designing and developing LLM-as-a-Judge
      autorater frameworks, AI-assisted evaluation systems, and
      automated evaluation pipelines. The engineer will directly
      work with models to create systems that critique, grade, and
      evaluate agent outputs, which is core AI/ML development work
      rather than supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Partner with Operations team and enterprise customers to translate ambiguity into
    structured evaluation data, guiding creation and maintenance of gold-standard
    human-rated datasets and expert rubrics
  - Analyze feedback and collected data to identify patterns, refine evaluation frameworks,
    and establish iterative improvement loops for human-curated assessments
  - Design, research, and develop LLM-as-a-Judge autorater frameworks and AI-assisted
    evaluation systems including models that critique, grade, and explain agent outputs
  - Pursue research initiatives exploring new methodologies for automatically analyzing,
    evaluating, and improving enterprise agent behavior
  use_cases:
  - LLM-powered workflow evaluation and safety assessment for enterprise applications
  - Automated grading and critique systems for AI agents using LLM-as-a-Judge methodologies
  - Quality assessment and reliability monitoring of enterprise AI agents and workflows
  - Human-in-the-loop evaluation systems combining expert rubrics with AI-assisted
    analysis
  - Continuous improvement loops for enterprise GenAI applications through automated
    evaluation pipelines
