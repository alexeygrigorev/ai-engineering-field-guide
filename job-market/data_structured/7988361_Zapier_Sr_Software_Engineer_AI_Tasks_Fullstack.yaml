      This is a full-stack engineering role building user
      interfaces and services that enable AI workflows (agents,
      chatbots, copilots). The engineer collaborates with AI
      experts and platform teams but focuses on building the
      application layer, orchestration infrastructure, and user-
      facing features rather than training, fine-tuning, or
      deploying models directly.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build features that allow users to delegate tasks and orchestrate workflows
    using natural language
  - Contribute to backend systems that manage agent memory, reasoning, execution,
    and system integrations
  - Build and refine user-facing features and interfaces for initiating, monitoring,
    and guiding agent behavior
  - Collaborate with AI and platform teams to connect Zapier Agents with core orchestration
    infrastructure
  - Own projects end-to-end from scoping and architecture to implementation, testing,
    and support
  - Improve developer experience, observability, and deployment pipelines as the product
    matures
  use_cases:
  - Natural language task delegation and workflow orchestration
  - AI-powered task extraction, classification, and summarization
  - Human-in-the-loop approval systems for production automations
  - Autonomous agents for workflow automation
  - LLM-native workflow integration for business automation
