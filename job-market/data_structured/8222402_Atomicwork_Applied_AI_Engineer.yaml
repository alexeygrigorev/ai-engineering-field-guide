  title: Applied AI Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on work building, fine-tuning, and
      deploying transformer-based models, RAG systems, and AI
      agents. The engineer works directly on the AI systems rather
      than supporting infrastructure or data pipelines for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and fine-tune transformer-based and retrieval-augmented models
    for natural language understanding, intent classification, summarization, and
    context-aware reasoning
  - Develop AI components that power automated knowledge search, semantic retrieval,
    agentic task orchestration, and conversational assistants
  - Integrate AI systems with production data pipelines in a scalable and secure way
  - Build evaluation pipelines, define metrics, and establish performance and reliability
    benchmarks for AI features
  - Collaborate with engineering, data, and product teams to productize models with
    observability, monitoring, and continuous improvement
  - Take end-to-end ownership of features from problem definition to deployment and
    performance monitoring
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise workflow automation powered by intelligent AI systems
  - Autonomous assistants for conversational task completion
  - Machine-assisted task automation with agentic orchestration
  - Automated knowledge search and semantic retrieval
  - Context-aware natural language understanding for enterprise workflows
