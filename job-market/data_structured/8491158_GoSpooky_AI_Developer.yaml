      This is an AI-first role focused on building, deploying, and
      orchestrating complex AI workflows including advanced RAG
      systems and multi-agent frameworks. The role involves hands-
      on work with GenAI frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex), model
      serving on Vertex AI, fine-tuning models, and implementing
      AI agents - all direct work ON AI systems rather than just
      supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop and deploy complex AI workflows (advanced RAG, multi-agent systems) integrated
    with core productivity tools
  - Build robust APIs and backends for RAG Pipelines and AI agents
  - Design and maintain scalable data pipelines for ETL, ingestion, and data preparation
    to ground models in high-quality data
  - Manage the testing deployment lifecycle, automating and versioning updates. Orchestrate
    models on Vertex AI (fine-tuning, serving, monitoring)
  - Implement AIOps and Agent Observability (tracing, logging, monitoring), while
    enforcing security for model inputs, outputs, and infrastructure
  use_cases:
  - Advanced RAG systems for information retrieval
  - Multi-agent systems for automated workflows
  - AI agents integrated with productivity tools
  - Model fine-tuning and serving on Vertex AI
  - Data pipelines for grounding models in high-quality data
