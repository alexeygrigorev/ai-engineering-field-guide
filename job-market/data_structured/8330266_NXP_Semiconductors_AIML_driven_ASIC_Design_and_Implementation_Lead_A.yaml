  title: AI/ML driven ASIC Design and Implementation Lead Automation Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves developing AI/ML solutions directly,
      specifically evaluating and implementing GenAI,
      Reinforcement Learning, Graph Neural Networks, and
      Convolutional Networks for VLSI design applications. The
      candidate will build prototype AI/ML systems to improve ASIC
      design flows, which is hands-on AI/ML development work
      rather than supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Explore and develop AI/ML applications for VLSI design and implementation
  - Evaluate state-of-the-art AI/ML techniques including GenAI, Reinforcement Learning,
    Graph Neural Networks, and Convolutional Networks
  - Collaborate with Architecture, IP design, SoC Design, Verification, and Implementation
    teams to drive automation improvements
  - Develop prototype solutions to pilot AI/ML methods on actual designs
  - Prescribe key methods and requirements for AI/ML CAD tools and features
  - Improve design quality, verification, and implementation flows for Edge-AI, Automotive
    Processors, and microcontrollers
  - Work with academic research communities to explore leading-edge SoC technologies
  use_cases:
  - ASIC design automation using AI/ML techniques
  - Improving power, performance, area, and verification quality of results
  - VLSI CAD optimization for semiconductor design flows
  - Automated SoC building for advanced node technologies
  - Edge-AI and automotive processor design enhancement
