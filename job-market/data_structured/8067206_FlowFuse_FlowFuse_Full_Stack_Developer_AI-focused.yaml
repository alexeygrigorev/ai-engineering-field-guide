      This role involves directly building AI-powered features by
      integrating LLM APIs, embeddings, and RAG systems into
      production. The engineer will design and implement AI
      components, handle failure modes, and establish patterns for
      others to extend - all hands-on work with AI systems, not
      just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Integrate LLM APIs and AI services into FlowFuse features and tooling
  - Build backend services and frontend interfaces that support AI-powered workflows
  - Prototype, evaluate, and productionize AI features with clear scope and guardrails
  - Design for AI failure modes, latency, cost, and operational constraints
  - Ensure AI features align with privacy, security, and SOC 2 requirements
  - Share best practices and patterns for applied AI across the engineering team
  - Contribute to broader fullstack product work as priorities evolve
  use_cases:
  - Intelligent search capabilities using embeddings and vector search
  - Content summarization powered by large language models
  - Validation systems using AI for data quality checks
  - Assistant-style workflows to enhance user productivity
  - AI-powered features for customer and internal engineering problems
