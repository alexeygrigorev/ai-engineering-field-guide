      This role involves hands-on work building LLM applications,
      designing RAG architectures, prompt engineering, and fine-
      tuning AI systems for text-to-SQL accuracy. The engineer
      directly deploys and troubleshoots models in production
      customer environments, rather than supporting other AI
      engineers.
  responsibilities:
  - Own the text-to-SQL accuracy problem end-to-end including evals, prompt iteration,
    and retrieval/routing improvements
  - Build and operate experimentation and evaluation loops with automatic evals, regression
    suites, and dataset curation
  - Design pragmatic LLM application architectures using RAG, agent routing, and tool-use
    orchestration optimized for accuracy and latency
  - Ship production-grade code, support deployments, and monitor/troubleshoot model
    behavior in real customer environments
  - Partner with engineering and customers to improve semantic models, SQL generation,
    and data alignment
  - Create user feedback loops to systematically capture issues and convert them into
    measurable improvements
  - Contribute to automation of environment provisioning and development workflows
    for fast iteration
  use_cases:
  - Natural language to SQL translation for data analytics
  - Enterprise data insights generation using AI-powered queries
  - Production-grade text-to-SQL systems for business intelligence
  - Contextually tuned AI deployments for customer data environments
  - Automated evaluation and regression testing for data agents
