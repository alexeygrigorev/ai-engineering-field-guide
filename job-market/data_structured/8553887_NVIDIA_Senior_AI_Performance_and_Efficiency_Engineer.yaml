  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on infrastructure optimization,
      performance analysis, and tooling to enable ML researchers,
      rather than building or deploying AI models directly. The
      engineer works on improving efficiency of GPU clusters and
      infrastructure that supports AI/ML workloads, making this an
      ai-support role.
  responsibilities:
  - Collaborate closely with AI/ML researchers to improve ML model efficiency and
    achieve cost savings
  - Build tools and frameworks to detect and analyze efficiency bottlenecks for researchers
  - Optimize ML workloads across Robotics, Autonomous vehicles, LLMs, and Video domains
  - Collaborate across engineering organizations to optimize hardware, software, and
    infrastructure usage
  - Monitor fleet-wide utilization patterns and deliver scalable solutions to address
    inefficiencies
  - Stay current with AI/ML technologies and advocate for integrating successful strategies
    within the organization
  use_cases:
  - Robotics model training and optimization
  - Autonomous vehicle AI systems
  - Large language model training and inference
  - Video processing and analysis
  - Distributed training for large-scale ML workloads
