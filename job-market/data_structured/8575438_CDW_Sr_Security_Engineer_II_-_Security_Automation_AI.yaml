position:
  title: Sr. Security Engineer II - Security Automation, AI & Orchestration
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This is a security automation role that leverages AI as an
      enabler for cyber defense operations, not as the primary
      focus. The engineer designs automation workflows and
      orchestration playbooks that integrate AI/ML insights to
      enhance security response, but does not build, train, or
      deploy AI models themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, build, and maintain automation workflows that transform security from
    detect and notify to detect, decide, and act
  - Engineer reusable automation services and playbooks across identity, endpoint,
    network, cloud, and SaaS control planes
  - Implement guardrails for automation and AI-assisted capabilities including confidence
    thresholds, blast-radius controls, and rollback mechanisms
  - Develop custom integrations using Python, PowerShell, APIs, AI prompts, and event-driven
    architectures
  - Partner with Cyber Defense Engineering to integrate high-quality signals suitable
    for automation and map MITRE ATT&CK techniques to automated responses
  - Build self-healing infrastructure that detects and corrects unsafe platform states
    without human intervention
  - Embed security controls into CI/CD pipelines using policy-as-code and automated
    testing processes
  - Orchestrate cross-pillar responses across identity, endpoint, network, and response
    domains
  use_cases:
  - Automated threat detection and response at machine speed
  - AI-assisted security decisioning with confidence thresholds and guardrails
  - Self-healing security infrastructure for identity, endpoint, and control plane
    remediation
  - Cross-platform security orchestration spanning cloud, SaaS, network, and endpoint
    systems
  - Policy-as-code security gates in CI/CD pipelines
  - Scalable, resilient automation for enterprise cyber defense
