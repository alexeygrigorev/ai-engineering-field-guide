  title: Staff Applied AI Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves directly building, deploying, and
      architecting a multi-agent LLM system. The engineer owns the
      multi-agent LLM reasoning layer, designs agent orchestration
      patterns, implements RAG and tool use, and deploys these
      systems to production with real-time constraints. This is
      hands-on work with models and agents, not just support
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Own the end-to-end technical direction for the multi-agent, multimodal platform
    that converts broadcast/radio inputs into validated, structured outputs from prototype
    to production
  - Design and evolve the agent architecture including agent boundaries, interfaces,
    orchestration patterns, evidence fusion, traceability/provenance, and schema-first
    outputs
  - Define reliability standards for probabilistic systems including confidence scoring,
    gating, escalation paths, and safe correction semantics
  - Drive performance and cost optimization through model routing strategies, batching,
    caching, and retries under real-time constraints
  - Partner across product, platform, and domain experts to translate ambiguous sport
    scenarios into system logic
  - Champion continuous improvement by evaluating new technologies, tools, and approaches
    where they provide clear value
  - Mentor and coach engineers across teams, supporting technical growth and raising
    the overall engineering bar
  use_cases:
  - Convert broadcast and radio inputs into validated structured outputs in real-time
  - Analyze multimodal sports data including audio, video, transcripts, and rules
  - Generate structured, schema-first outputs with versioning for sports analytics
  - Apply multi-agent reasoning to complex sports scenarios and decisions
  - Provide confidence scoring and human-in-the-loop escalation for uncertain outputs
