    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building platforms and infrastructure
      that enable AI/ML work for others, rather than directly
      building, training, or deploying models. While the role
      involves GenAI and LLM technologies, the primary
      responsibility is creating the tooling, frameworks, and
      services that data scientists and engineers use to build and
      deploy AI solutions. The emphasis is on platform
      architecture, governance, compliance, and infrastructure -
      classic AI platform engineering that supports AI development
      rather than hands-on model work.
  responsibilities:
  - Define technical vision and architecture for Natera's ML and GenAI platforms ensuring
    scalability, reliability, and compliance
  - Build, operate, and evolve core AI platform components including data access,
    LLM model registries, evaluation pipelines, vector databases, RAG frameworks,
    and agent frameworks
  - Design, build, and operate end-to-end ML/DL/FM infrastructure covering feature
    engineering, distributed training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring
  - Implement production-grade GenAI and ML services and APIs powering critical workflows
    from genomics analytics to clinical trial optimization
  - Lead deployment and scaling of large models using modern MLOps practices including
    Kubernetes, MLflow, and AWS-native services
  - Embed governance and monitoring guardrails into AI/ML pipelines including bias
    testing, safety, security, hallucination detection, and audit trails
  - Set coding standards, review designs, and ensure best practices in reproducibility,
    monitoring, and observability as principal technical authority
  - Evaluate and integrate emerging AI/ML technologies including foundation models,
    multimodal AI, biomedical reasoning agents, and federated learning
  use_cases:
  - Genomics analytics and clinical trial optimization for diagnostics
  - Patient-facing solutions and provider engagement workflows
  - R&D, Lab Ops, Clinical Trials, and Billing workflow automation
  - Unstructured data extraction, classification, summarization, and generation from
    knowledge bases
  - Domain-specific copilots for lab workflows and clinical operations
  - Personalized genetic testing and earlier targeted interventions
