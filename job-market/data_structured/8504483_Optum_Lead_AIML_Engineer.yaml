position:
  title: Lead AI/ML Engineer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is a hands-on technical leader role that directly works
      on building and deploying AI/ML systems, including LLMs, RAG
      pipelines, fine-tuning, and vector indexing. The role
      requires end-to-end ownership of ML/GenAI solutions from
      data pipelines to model deployment and MLOps, making it
      clearly ai-first rather than ai-support.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead architecture and delivery of ML/GenAI solutions including classification,
    forecasting, NLP, deep learning, and LLM apps at production scale
  - Build robust data and feature pipelines over large clinical and claims datasets
    using Python, pandas, NumPy, and SQL
  - Develop and deploy LLM capabilities including prompt design, fine-tuning, RAG
    pipelines, vector indexing, and evaluation with guardrails
  - Establish MLOps and LLMOps best practices including CI/CD, model registry, experiment
    tracking, monitoring, drift detection, A/B testing, and cost/performance optimization
  - Ensure data privacy and compliance with HIPAA/PHI handling, access controls, and
    auditability while championing model governance and Responsible AI
  - Translate business problems into technical roadmaps and communicate trade-offs
    and results to executives and non-technical partners
  - Mentor engineers and set engineering standards including code reviews, documentation,
    reliability, and observability
  use_cases:
  - Healthcare operations optimization through ML models for classification and forecasting
  - Patient outcome improvement using NLP and deep learning on clinical data
  - Clinical decision support via LLM applications with RAG and retrieval systems
  - Healthcare claims processing and analysis using ML solutions
  - Data-driven healthcare insights from large-scale clinical and claims datasets
