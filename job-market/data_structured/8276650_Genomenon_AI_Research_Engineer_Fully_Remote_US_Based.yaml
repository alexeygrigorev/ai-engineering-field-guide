      This role involves hands-on development of AI models
      including multimodal deep learning, graph neural networks,
      transformers, and causal inference. The position requires
      building, training, and deploying production-grade AI
      systems from research to implementation.
  responsibilities:
  - Develop multimodal AI models integrating text, graph, and structured data
  - Prototype and productionize graph neural networks (e.g., HGT, GraphSAGE, transformer-based
    GNNs)
  - Build, train, and evaluate large-scale transformer models for scientific and biomedical
    NLP
  - Design and implement causal inference components, including ATE and CATE estimation
  - Collaborate closely with domain experts and product teams to translate research
    into deployed capabilities
  - Ensure model safety, calibration, provenance, and regulatory compliance
  - Contribute to production ML workflows, including model training, evaluation, and
    deployment pipelines
  use_cases:
  - Transforming scientific literature into real world evidence for precision medicine
  - Supporting clinical diagnostics and variant interpretation for rare diseases and
    cancer
  - Enabling literature-derived evidence across clinical trial development, regulatory,
    and commercial workflows
  - Helping clinicians make better diagnostic and therapeutic decisions
  - Supporting life sciences organizations in bringing better therapies to market
    faster
