      This is an SRE role focused on system reliability,
      automation, and observability. While there is interest in
      leveraging GenAI for operational solutions and automation,
      the role does not involve building, training, fine-tuning,
      or deploying AI/ML models directly. The AI component is
      about applying AI tools to enhance SRE capabilities rather
      than developing AI systems.

  - Maintain and improve the availability, reliability, and performance of all production
    systems
  - Implement and manage application monitoring and observability solutions using
    Grafana and Prometheus
  - Develop and maintain automation to streamline operations and reduce manual intervention
  - Participate in the software development lifecycle using SRE/DevOps practices and
    CI/CD pipelines
  - Troubleshoot, debug, and resolve software and infrastructure issues across the
    technology stack
  - Collaborate with development teams to design scalable and reliable systems
  - Continuously learn and apply emerging technologies in data solutions, AI, and
    machine learning
