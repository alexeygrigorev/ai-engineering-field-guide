    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role requires hands-on building of AI systems including
      RAG architectures, agentic workflows, prompt engineering,
      and model optimization. The engineer directly architects and
      implements multi-modal AI systems and LLM-powered
      applications, not just infrastructure or support.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the design and architecture of enterprise-scale full stack applications using
    modern frameworks and AI-assisted development workflows
  - Architect and implement sophisticated full stack applications incorporating advanced
    AI capabilities such as natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive
    analytics
  - Design and implement advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and
    multi-modal AI architectures
  - Architect and implement agentic workflows that enable autonomous AI systems to
    perform complex, multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention
  - Provide technical oversight and mentorship for third-party contractors, ensuring
    deliverables meet architectural standards and integrate seamlessly with internal
    systems
  - Establish and enforce comprehensive testing strategies for AI-integrated features,
    including advanced prompt regression testing and model performance validation
  - Evaluate and integrate emerging AI technologies and tools to maintain competitive
    advantage
  - Establish monitoring, observability, and cost management frameworks for AI systems
    at scale
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise RAG systems for knowledge retrieval and question answering
  - Agentic workflows enabling autonomous AI systems to perform complex multi-step
    tasks
  - Multi-modal AI applications combining text, vision, and predictive analytics
  - AI-powered full stack applications for energy sector solutions
  - Natural language processing interfaces for enterprise systems
  - Semantic search and conversation memory management at scale
