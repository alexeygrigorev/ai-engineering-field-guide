  title: Generative AI Developer
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work building Generative AI and
      Agentic systems including prompt engineering, fine-tuning
      models (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), implementing RAG, and
      developing/training generative models. The position directly
      works ON AI systems rather than just supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Write clean, efficient, and well-documented code manually and in an automated
    fashion using tools like GitHub Copilot
  - Work with product teams to understand user requirements and translate them into
    AI-driven solutions
  - Develop and refine prompts for known large language models (LLMs) to enhance AI
    model performance using techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  - Develop, train, and optimize generative AI models including text, image, audio,
    or video generation systems
  - Fine-tune pre-trained models such as GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro for specific use
    cases and datasets
  - Develop Agentic AI solutions and integrate AI models into scalable production
    pipelines and applications
  use_cases:
  - Healthcare information access and utilization enhancement
  - Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems with AI capabilities
  - Billing, Payment services, and Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) optimization
  - AI-powered content creation, enhancement, and analysis for healthcare professionals
  - Automated manual process automation through Agentic AI systems
