      This role requires designing, developing, and deploying AI
      planning algorithms using SAT/SMT solvers, constraint
      programming, combinatorial optimization, and AI planning
      technologies. The engineer will directly build and implement
      state-of-the-art decision-making systems for robotics and
      manufacturing, not just supporting infrastructure or data
      pipelines for other AI teams.
  responsibilities:
  - Design, develop, and deploy innovative AI planning algorithms using the latest
    task planning and scheduling techniques
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to integrate and optimize AI planning
    solutions into products and processes
  - Determine the system design and deployment architecture for AI software pipeline
  - Participate in end-to-end solution including system and infrastructure design,
    algorithm development, and production deployment
  use_cases:
  - AI-powered task planning and scheduling for robotics and manufacturing
  - Optimization of complex integrated vehicle structure assembly processes
  - Decision-making systems for manufacturing efficiency and product quality
  - Constraint programming for flexible manufacturing and customization
  - Combinatorial optimization for production scheduling and resource allocation
