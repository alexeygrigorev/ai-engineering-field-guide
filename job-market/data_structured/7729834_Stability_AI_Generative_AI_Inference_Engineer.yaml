      This role is hands-on with generative AI models,
      specifically working on inference systems, optimization, and
      deployment of multi-modal models including diffusion
      architectures. The engineer directly works on model tuning,
      inference pipeline development, and deploying state-of-the-
      art generative models to production.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead efforts to drive the design, development of customer-facing multi-modal ML
    inference systems
  - Work with Platform and Inference teams on building inference systems for next-generation
    models including optimization, model tuning and deployment
  - Partner with leading cloud providers to deliver hosted Stability AI inference
    solutions
  - Be a strategic thought partner for leaders on driving business impact through
    machine learning
  - Bring new Stability models and pipelines into existence
  - Prototype and productionize inference platform improvements and new features
  use_cases:
  - Multi-modal generative AI inference for creative applications
  - Diffusion model-based content generation
  - High-performance inference optimization for generative models
  - Cloud-hosted inference solutions for Stability AI models
  - Production ML systems for image and multi-modal content creation
