  title: Principal AI Developer - Cybersecurity Operations
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This role involves building, fine-tuning, and deploying
      Generative AI models and agentic workflows. The developer
      will directly work with LLMs, agents, model training, and
      inference systems - not just supporting infrastructure for
      AI work.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect and lead the development of agentic workflows and fine-tuned models
    for the automation of security operations processes
  - Establish ML and data pipelines for the training and deployment of fine-tuned
    generative AI and machine learning models
  - Design scalable systems to unify and correlate data across heterogeneous sources
    using rule-based, probabilistic, and ML-based approaches
  - Work with security operations teams to measure, monitor, and evaluate AI quality
    and iteratively improve
  - Define best practices for building secure, observable, and scalable AI systems
    in cloud-native environments
  - Guide the evolution of AI strategy, influencing product roadmaps and technical
    direction
  - Mentor senior engineers and foster a culture of innovation and excellence across
    teams
  - Stay ahead of emerging trends in entity resolution, knowledge graphs, and agentic
    AI
  use_cases:
  - Automate threat detection, investigation, and response processes using AI-powered
    workflows
  - Collate and analyze security operations process data from diverse telemetry sources
  - Integrate knowledge graphs with agentic workflows for structured reasoning in
    security operations
  - Measure and guarantee quality of AI outputs across global security operations
    teams
  - Enable automated security operations through fine-tuned generative AI and ML models
  - Support adversarial behavior modeling and threat detection using intelligent systems
