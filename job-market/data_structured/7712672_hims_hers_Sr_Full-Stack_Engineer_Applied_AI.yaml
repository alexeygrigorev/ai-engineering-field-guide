    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building infrastructure, orchestration
      systems, SDKs, and evaluation pipelines that enable AI
      workloads rather than directly building, training, or fine-
      tuning models. The engineer builds the platforms and tools
      that support AI researchers and data scientists, including
      workflow orchestration, observability systems, and unified
      AI gateways.

  - Design and build scalable AI workflow systems including orchestration runtimes,
    SDKs, and observability pipelines for real-time intelligent experiences
  - Develop end-to-end features using TypeScript (Cloudflare Workers, React/Next.js)
    and Python (Databricks, evaluation, data processing)
  - Integrate and evaluate LLMs and ML systems through a unified AI Gateway, connecting
    OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex, and Databricks
  - Build tool connectors and APIs for internal domains including EHR, Pharmacy, Payments,
    Orders, and Care to enable safe automated workflows
  - Develop evaluation and feedback systems that measure quality, grounding, latency,
    and safety of AI-powered flows
  - Contribute to shared TypeScript and Python SDKs that standardize event schemas,
    tool contracts, and developer experience across Applied AI
  use_cases:
  - Conversational AI agents for health coaching and patient interactions
  - Automated care workflows connecting EHR, pharmacy, payment, and order systems
    for seamless healthcare delivery
  - Health automation systems that intelligently route and process patient care requests
  - AI-powered logistics and fulfillment optimization for healthcare products
