    type: ml-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is a pure ML research role focused on traditional
      reinforcement learning for robotics systems - implementing
      multi-agent RL, training agents, deploying models to real-
      world robotics platforms. The work involves deep learning-
      based approaches for control and automation but does not
      involve LLMs, RAG, or generative AI systems.
  responsibilities:
  - Implement, improve and extend state of the art in multi-agent reinforcement learning
  - Design, train and deploy reinforcement learning agents for robots in complex environments
  - Collaborate across multiple teams and backgrounds on AI projects
  - Reimplement and extend state of the art Deep Learning-based approaches from research
    papers
  use_cases:
  - Robotic perception and assistance for human decision-making in defence applications
  - Multi-agent reinforcement learning systems deployed in real-world robotics platforms
  - Autonomous control of complex robotic systems in challenging environments with
    high generalization requirements
  - Robust reinforcement learning systems against adversarial attacks in defence scenarios
