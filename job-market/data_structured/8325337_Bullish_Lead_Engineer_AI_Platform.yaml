    reasoning: |-
      This role involves hands-on building of AI systems including
      LLM-based applications, multi-agent orchestration, RAG
      pipelines, and agent frameworks. The engineer is directly
      designing and implementing production AI systems with tools
      like LangChain, LangGraph, and LlamaIndex, not just
      supporting infrastructure for others.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and implement production AI systems with emphasis on reliability, observability,
    and continuous evaluation
  - Lead development of natural-language interfaces to business data through governed
    semantic layers
  - Architect multi-agent systems that coordinate across data sources with proper
    orchestration and tool use
  - Build evaluation harnesses and testing frameworks that measure AI system quality
    before production deployment
  - Partner with data engineering to define and enforce semantic models bridging raw
    data to AI-consumable formats
  - Mentor engineers, establish coding standards, and drive architectural decisions
    balancing innovation with stability
  use_cases:
  - Conversational analytics enabling stakeholders to query complex business datasets
    through natural language
  - Multi-agent systems for coordinating across data sources and applying industry
    best practices for agent orchestration
  - AI-powered intelligence across digital asset exchange, media, data, and indices
    businesses
  - Compliance and trading applications requiring observable, testable, and auditable
    AI outputs
  - Enterprise solutions spanning trading floors to compliance with governed semantic
    layers
