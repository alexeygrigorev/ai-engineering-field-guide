    reasoning: |-
      This is an AI Platform Engineering role focused on building
      infrastructure, APIs, orchestration, and tooling to enable
      other teams to consume AI capabilities. The engineer builds
      platforms and foundations for AI adoption rather than
      directly building, training, or fine-tuning models
      themselves.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and build the AI platform that powers LLMs, agents, and other AI solutions
    across Dojo
  - Develop APIs, SDKs, and tooling that allow product teams to consume AI capabilities
    at scale
  - Implement orchestration for multi-model and multi-service workflows using frameworks
    like LangGraph, Crew AI, and agentic frameworks
  - Build and manage vector search and retrieval systems to support RAG and knowledge
    integration
  - Build robust monitoring, logging, and guardrails to ensure AI systems are safe,
    observable, and compliant
  - Automate infrastructure and model deployment with Kubernetes, Terraform, and CI/CD
    pipelines
  - Partner with security, compliance, and product teams to ensure safe use of AI
    in production
  use_cases:
  - Enabling product teams to consume LLM capabilities at scale through APIs and SDKs
  - Orchestrating multi-model and multi-service AI workflows using agentic frameworks
  - Supporting RAG implementations with vector search and retrieval systems
  - Monitoring and ensuring safety of AI systems in production environments
  - Deploying and managing AI models through automated infrastructure pipelines
