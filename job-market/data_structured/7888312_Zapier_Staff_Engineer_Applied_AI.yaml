  name: Zapier
  stage: Series D+
  focus: Automation platform and AI orchestration
position:
  title: Staff Engineer, Applied AI
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      This is an ai-first role because the engineer will work
      directly on building LLM systems, including agent
      architectures, RAG implementations, and orchestration
      platforms. The role requires hands-on production experience
      with large language models and involves creating the
      foundational AI execution platform that powers AI products.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead key architectural efforts in the unified AI platform, defining orchestrator
    architecture, shared runtime components, and foundational APIs
  - Guide high-impact technical decisions around orchestration patterns, execution
    flows, shared tools, memory, safety, and data model design
  - Provide technical oversight for consolidating multiple runtimes into a single
    orchestrator while balancing reliability, speed, safety, and developer ergonomics
  - Partner deeply with product teams across the AI organization to support migrations,
    define interfaces, and translate product needs into platform capabilities
  - Mentor engineers and raise the technical bar for AI Capabilities by sharing patterns
    and teaching practical AI engineering
  - Deploy and maintain evaluation frameworks for LLMs covering performance, reliability,
    and bias metrics
  use_cases:
  - Building unified AI orchestration platform that powers agents, chatbots, and AI
    automation products
  - Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems with semantic search
    and vector databases
  - Creating scalable, safe, and cost-efficient runtime systems for user-facing AI
    products
  - Enabling millions of businesses to automate workflows using intelligent AI-powered
    orchestration
  - Supporting complex agent architectures that can execute multi-step automation
