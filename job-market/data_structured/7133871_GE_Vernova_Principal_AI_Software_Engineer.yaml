      This role involves direct hands-on work building AI-native
      applications including RAG systems, agentic workflows, and
      LLM integrations. The candidate is responsible for
      architecting and deploying these AI systems, not just
      supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Define and drive technical vision and architecture for AI-native applications
    across multiple product areas
  - Design and architect enterprise-scale full stack applications with sophisticated
    AI integrations across NLP, computer vision, and predictive analytics
  - Architect advanced RAG systems, agentic workflows, and autonomous AI architectures
  - Design cost-efficient, scalable LLM integration strategies across multiple providers
    with optimization and failover mechanisms
  - Establish technical standards, design patterns, and best practices for AI-augmented
    development across the organization
  - Lead cross-functional technical initiatives and drive technical decision-making
    for complex systems spanning multiple teams
  - Establish monitoring, observability, and cost management frameworks for AI systems
    across the organization
  - Champion engineering best practices including testing, code quality, security,
    and scalability standards
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise-scale AI-native applications serving millions of users
  - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems for knowledge retrieval and question
    answering
  - Agentic workflows and autonomous AI architectures
  - Natural language processing applications
  - Computer vision systems
  - Predictive analytics for energy and industrial applications
