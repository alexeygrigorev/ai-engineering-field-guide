      This role is building user interfaces and workflows that
      consume AI capabilities (LLMs, ML inference servers) but
      does not involve building, training, fine-tuning, or
      deploying models themselves. The engineer is stitching
      together LLMs with backend services and frontend to create
      prototypes, while the actual AI/ML work is done by separate
      ML researchers and teams.
  responsibilities:
  - Building complete, integrated prototypes that bring AI capabilities to life in
    production workflows - stitching together LLMs, backend services, and polished
    frontend interfaces
  - Architecting and developing interactive workflow UIs that make complex verification
    workflows feel approachable
  - Collaborating closely with product designers to ensure pixel-perfect implementation
    and maintain an exceptionally high bar for interface quality and usability
  - Owning APIs and orchestration patterns that connect frontends with ML inference
    servers and backend services
  - Partnering with ML researchers, product teams and users to translate complex technical
    requirements into proof-of-concept features that integrate AI capabilities seamlessly
  - Driving engineering roadmaps in collaboration with researchers, hardware experts,
    and product managers to discover and propose features
  use_cases:
  - AI-assisted semiconductor verification workflows that help hardware engineers
    build and verify chips
  - Interfaces and workflows that make complex verification processes more approachable
    through AI augmentation
  - AI-powered workflows integrated into existing semiconductor design and verification
