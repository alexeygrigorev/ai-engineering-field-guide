  title: Senior Silicon Design Engineer - AI
  ai_type:
    type: ai-first
    reasoning: |-
      The role involves hands-on work building AI/ML systems
      including fine-tuning LLMs, implementing RAG pipelines, and
      applying reinforcement learning for optimization problems in
      semiconductor design. The engineer will directly develop AI-
      driven workflows and build LLM-based solutions for specific
      domain applications.
  responsibilities:
  - Architect, design, and implement AI/ML-driven workflows for DRAM/NAND memory subsystems
    and controllers
  - Improve design and layout efficiency through AI-based automation, leveraging Python
    and LLMs
  - Perform block- and chip-level simulations, debugging, and functional verification
  - Collaborate closely with design and CAD teams to develop and customize tools that
    accelerate design qualification and turnaround time
  - Apply industry-standard EDA tools such as Cadence Verisium, Virtuoso Layout Suite,
    Siemens Solido for synthesis, simulation, parasitic estimation, and layout-aware
    optimization
  - Develop standard cell layout automation using Python and SKILL programming
  use_cases:
  - Semiconductor design automation and optimization
  - Memory subsystem design qualification
  - Design and layout efficiency improvements for DRAM/NAND controllers
  - EDA tool integration and workflow acceleration
  - Variation-aware design optimization
