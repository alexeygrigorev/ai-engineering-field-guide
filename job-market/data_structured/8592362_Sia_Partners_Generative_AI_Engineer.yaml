      The role involves hands-on building and deploying GenAI
      systems including LLM applications, RAG pipelines,
      autonomous agents, and fine-tuning models. This is direct
      work on AI systems, not just supporting infrastructure or
      general software engineering.
  responsibilities:
  - Build LLM-powered applications using LangChain, LlamaIndex, and related GenAI
    frameworks
  - Implement RAG pipelines with vector databases for grounding LLM responses with
    internal knowledge
  - Develop multimodal AI solutions and build autonomous agents for various use cases
  - Design robust prompt templates using CoT, ReAct, Graph-of-Thought, and Agent flows
  - Deploy GenAI models on AWS/GCP/Azure using services like SageMaker, Bedrock, Vertex
    AI
  - Benchmark LLMs and evaluate fine-tuning strategies including PEFT, LoRA, and RLHF
  - Support solution architects and cross-functional teams in delivering PoCs and
    enterprise-grade rollouts
  - Ensure performance observability, security guardrails, and compliance with GDPR
    and Responsible AI principles
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise search and knowledge management through RAG systems
  - Multimodal AI applications processing text, audio, and image data
  - Autonomous agents for automating complex business workflows
  - Customer-facing applications powered by LLMs across diverse industries
  - Domain-specific solutions through fine-tuning on proprietary data
