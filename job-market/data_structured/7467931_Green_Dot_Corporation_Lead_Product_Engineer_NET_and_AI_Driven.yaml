position:
  title: Lead Product Engineer – .NET and AI Driven
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      The role uses AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude) as
      development aids to write, test, and refactor code within an
      AI-enhanced SDLC. However, the engineer is not building,
      training, deploying, or fine-tuning AI models themselves -
      they are building traditional .NET financial applications
      using AI as a productivity tool.
  responsibilities:
  - Lead the design, development, and deployment of enterprise-grade applications
    using .NET, C#, and SQL Server
  - Architect and execute Azure migration strategies, including re-platforming and
    modernization of legacy systems
  - Build and optimize cloud-native solutions leveraging Azure services such as AKS,
    Cosmos DB, App Services, and Functions
  - Operate in an AI-driven SDLC environment using AI copilots to translate specifications,
    iterate on designs, and write code
  - Implement intelligent testing frameworks that auto-generate test cases, predict
    bugs, and enable self-healing
  - Write automated tests concurrently with code development to ensure continuous
    integration and delivery
  - Mentor junior engineers and promote best practices in cloud engineering and AI-assisted
    development
  use_cases:
  - Smart money management and payment solutions for consumers
  - Enterprise-grade financial services applications
  - Cloud-native applications migrated from legacy systems
  - AI-enhanced development workflows for faster delivery
  - Automated testing and quality assurance frameworks
  - Scalable financial transaction processing
