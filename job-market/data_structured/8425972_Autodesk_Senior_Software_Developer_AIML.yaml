      This is a hands-on role building, fine-tuning, and deploying
      LLM-based agentic AI systems with RAG and MCP integrations.
      The role requires direct model work (fine-tuning,
      evaluation, deployment) and implementing agentic
      architectures, not just supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and ship production-grade cloud-native Agentic AI applications that are
    resilient, performant, and scale well in production
  - Fine-tune, evaluate, and deploy large language models in production environments
  - Implement evaluation and observability standards including regression tests, monitoring,
    and feedback loops
  - Integrate agents with internal and external services using MCP-based integrations
    or equivalent tool/context integration patterns
  - Partner with product managers, architects, developers, and data scientists to
    bring AI features to Autodesk products
  - Use AI coding agents to accelerate delivery of production features and fixes with
    rigorous verification and security-aware usage
  use_cases:
  - Product Data Management (PDM) workflows enhanced with AI agents
  - Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) workflows with intelligent automation
  - CAD and manufacturing domain applications with AI assistance
  - Enterprise tool integration through MCP-based agent architectures
