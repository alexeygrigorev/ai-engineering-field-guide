  title: Automation Engineer - AI Insights (m/f/d)
  ai_type:
    type: ai-support
    reasoning: |-
      This role focuses on building data pipelines, automation
      systems, and infrastructure that power AI workflows rather
      than directly building, training, or fine-tuning models. The
      engineer creates the foundation (pipelines, APIs, indexing,
      retrieval systems) that enables AI features like RAG to
      function, which is classic ai-support work.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and optimize scalable, high-performance data pipelines connecting databases,
    schemas, and advanced retrieval logic for structured and unstructured data
  - Develop automation systems for rule-based retrieval and dynamic content generation
    enabling real-time, large-scale insight delivery
  - Ensure data and content are efficiently stored, indexed, and available via robust
    APIs and partner integrations to power AI features
  - Analyze and address bottlenecks to advance data automation strategy and improve
    content workflows for scalability and performance
  use_cases:
  - Automated insight delivery from simple queries to AI-powered outputs
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for next-gen AI features
  - Dynamic content generation at scale using rule-based retrieval
  - Large-scale data indexing and retrieval across products and partner platforms
