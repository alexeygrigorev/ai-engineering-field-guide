    reasoning: |-
      The role is a Forward Deployed Engineer who directly deploys
      and integrates Large Quantitative Models (LQMs) and Agentic
      systems into client environments. The engineer is
      responsible for architecting custom solutions that wrap
      scientific application logic around AI models and
      orchestrating the entire deployment lifecycle, which is
      hands-on work with AI systems rather than just supporting
      infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - 'Orchestrate Technical Delivery: Partner with scientific teams to audit workflows,
    diagnose technical blockers, and take full accountability for the end-to-end technical
    execution of client contracts'
  - 'Architect and Develop Solutions: Design and deploy high-velocity code to extend
    existing tools, or build new frameworks for wrapping scientific logic and automating
    complex R&D workflows'
  - 'Drive Cross-Functional Collaboration: Serve as the technical translator between
    non-technical researchers and product teams, validating proposed solutions and
    ensuring they meet rigorous scientific requirements'
  - 'Scale and Optimize Infrastructure: Own the deployment and maintenance of cloud-based
    compute resources and data pipelines, ensuring stability and performance throughout
    the contract lifecycle'
  - 'Pioneer Technical Integration: Lead the integration of internal core technologies,
    such as LQMs and Agentic systems, into bespoke client environments to solve major
    scientific challenges'
  use_cases:
  - Drug discovery and chemical simulation
  - Scientific research and R&D workflow automation
  - Knowledge graph applications
  - Multi-agent AI systems for scientific computing
  - Numerical optimization and simulation
  - Cheminformatics and advanced materials research
