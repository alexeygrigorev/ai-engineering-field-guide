      This is a founding AI Engineer role focused on advancing AI
      capabilities in LLMs, program synthesis, and reasoning
      agents. The position involves hands-on work training and
      post-training LLMs, building prototypes, and integrating
      models into production - all direct work on AI systems
      rather than supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Conduct cutting-edge research in LLMs, reasoning agents, and program synthesis
    to advance Diamond's AI capabilities
  - Design and develop prototypes and proof-of-concept models for AI applications
  - Translate research into practical applications by working closely with engineering
    to integrate models into production
  - Stay current with the AI research landscape and apply insights from the latest
    work in transformer models, interpretability, and alignment
  use_cases:
  - Context-aware code generation for engineering workflows
  - Autonomous technical planning and reasoning agents
  - Program synthesis for automated code generation
  - AI-assisted code review and development workflows
