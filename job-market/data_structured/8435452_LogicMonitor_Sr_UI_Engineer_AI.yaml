      This is a Senior UI Engineer role building frontend
      interfaces for AI-powered observability features (Edwin AI,
      AIOps workflows, GenAI copilots). The role focuses on
      visualizing and presenting AI-driven insights through
      dashboards, chat consoles, and data visualizations, but does
      not involve building, training, fine-tuning, or deploying
      the actual AI models or reasoning engines.

  - Build and deliver AI-powered interfaces for Edwin AI and AIOps workflows including
    chat consoles, anomaly correlation explorers, and root-cause investigation views
  - Utilize GenAI-based UI offerings like Lovable to prototype and productionise UI
    features
  - Enable real-time interactions between observability data (metrics, logs, traces)
    and the AI reasoning engine
  - Develop with React and TypeScript, contributing to the migration of legacy ReScript
    code
  - Style scalable, accessible interfaces using Tailwind CSS v4 and Material UI
  - Manage complex UI state via Zustand and Tanstack Query/Forms/Router for data orchestration
  - Collaborate with data science and AI teams to visualize anomaly explanations,
    event correlations, and root-cause predictions
  use_cases:
  - Chat-driven troubleshooting for IT operations
  - Intelligent dashboards for observability data visualization
  - Anomaly correlation and root-cause investigation
  - Real-time monitoring of metrics, logs, and traces
  - GenAI copilots for IT infrastructure insights
  - AIOps workflows for predictive operations
