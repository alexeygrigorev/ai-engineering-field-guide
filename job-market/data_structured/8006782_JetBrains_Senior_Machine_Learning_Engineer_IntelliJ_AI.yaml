      The role involves direct work on LLMs and agent
      architectures, including building and maintaining models
      (re-rankers, classifiers, embeddings), fine-tuning
      lightweight models, designing evaluation frameworks for AI
      features, and diagnosing model performance issues. This is
      hands-on work building and optimizing AI systems, not just
      supporting infrastructure.
  responsibilities:
  - Design and drive evaluation frameworks for AI features, including metrics, experiments,
    and agent trace analysis
  - Diagnose model performance issues such as prompt drift, context mismatches, and
    latency/quality trade-offs
  - Experiment with contexts and lightweight models to continuously develop the ML
    system
  - Act as ML liaison for product teams across JetBrains, adapting and scaling AI
    capabilities
  - Build and maintain small helper models including re-rankers, classifiers, and
    embedding models
  - Collaborate with ML, product, engineering, and analytic teams to deliver improvements
    and monitor production impact
  - Stay current with research in LLMs, agents, and evaluation frameworks
  - Mentor junior engineers and shape team culture around experimentation and evaluation
  use_cases:
  - AI assistance for the entire software development lifecycle within JetBrains IDEs
  - Developer workflow acceleration through advanced AI features embedded in IDEs
  - Context-aware pipelines for code completion and generation tasks
  - Agent-based systems for multi-step reasoning in development environments
  - Domain-specific AI capabilities tailored to different JetBrains product teams
