      This is a hands-on engineering role building AI features
      directly - AI agents, RAG systems, and LLM-powered tools.
      The engineer will build infrastructure for LLM inference and
      run A/B experiments on production AI use cases, working
      directly on implementing and deploying AI solutions rather
      than just supporting them.
  responsibilities:
  - Ship full-stack AI projects end-to-end on a product built in Ruby on Rails backend
    and React frontend
  - Design and run experiments including A/B tests and AI evaluations to validate
    AI features and guide iteration
  - Build and integrate components for AI infrastructure and optimize them for performance
    and reliability to support production-level inferencing
  - Improve processes, tools, and systems to scale AI features into production-ready
    solutions
  - Stay up-to-date with cutting-edge AI research, techniques, and tools
  - Work closely with Circle's leaders and designers throughout the feature design
    process
  use_cases:
  - AI agents for community automation and engagement
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for intelligent content retrieval
    and generation
  - LLM-powered tools for enhancing community interactions and content creation
  - AI evaluations and observability for monitoring AI feature performance
  - Production-level LLM inference infrastructure for scalable AI deployment
