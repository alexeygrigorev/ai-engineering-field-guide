      The job title is Senior AI/ML Engineer but the description
      and skills focus heavily on traditional statistical
      analysis, ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn),
      and data engineering tasks. "Agentic AI" is mentioned under
      requirements but no specifics are provided about building
      agents, LLM systems, or related AI work, making it
      impossible to definitively classify the role.
  responsibilities:
  - Perform statistical analysis including hypothesis testing, T-tests, Z-tests, and
    regression analysis
  - Implement classification algorithms using decision trees, SVM, and other ML techniques
  - Develop forecasting models using exponential smoothing, ARIMA, and ARIMAX methods
  - Utilize ML frameworks including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn for model
    development
  - Work with probabilistic graph models and distance-based algorithms
  - Use data quality and monitoring tools like Great Expectations and Evidently AI
  use_cases:
  - Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing for business insights
  - Classification and regression modeling for predictive analytics
  - Time series forecasting for business planning
  - Data quality monitoring and validation
