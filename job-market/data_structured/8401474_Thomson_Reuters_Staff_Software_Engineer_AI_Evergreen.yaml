      The role is hands-on building AI systems: designing RAG
      pipelines, creating agentic workflows with tool/function
      calling, developing Semantic Kernel skills, and implementing
      Azure OpenAI capabilities. This is direct work on LLM-based
      systems (RAG, agents, function calling) rather than
      supporting infrastructure or general software engineering.
  responsibilities:
  - Build and own .NET services and REST APIs integrated with Azure OpenAI and Azure
    AI Services
  - Design RAG pipelines using Azure AI Search with hybrid retrieval, chunking strategies,
    grounding, and citations
  - Create agentic workflows using tool/function calling, planning, memory, and guardrails
    for safe execution
  - Develop Semantic Kernel skills, connectors, and planners to orchestrate intelligent
    behavior
  - Implement robust observability across latency, cost, token usage, and quality
    metrics using App Insights and OpenTelemetry
  - Lead through engineering excellence by mentoring teammates, writing RFCs, and
    guiding architecture decisions
  use_cases:
  - Enterprise search and information retrieval with hybrid search capabilities
  - AI-powered workflows with agentic systems for intelligent task automation
  - Document intelligence and knowledge management with citation accuracy
  - Safe and compliant AI applications with guardrails and PII handling
  - Real-time AI interactions with streaming responses and cost optimization
