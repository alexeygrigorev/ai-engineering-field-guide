      This is primarily a Full Stack .NET engineering role focused
      on building applications for Centerfield's marketing
      platforms. While the job mentions AI/ML knowledge as "bonus
      points" including RAG, agents, vector databases, and
      transformers, the core responsibilities are about technical
      leadership, system architecture, and software development -
      not directly building, training, or deploying AI models. The
      AI/ML skills are listed as nice-to-have for someone to work
      with AI-related features, but the role itself is not AI-
      first.
  responsibilities:
  - Drive technical initiatives while staying hands-on in development
  - Partner with cross-functional teams to translate business needs into technical
    solutions
  - Mentor and support junior developers through coaching and collaboration
  - Define and drive system architecture and design for scalable, high-performance
    applications
  - Document development phases and monitor systems for quality and goals alignment
  - Refine team processes and best practices
  - Evaluate and recommend new technologies and tools to improve our platforms
  use_cases:
  - Outcome-based digital marketing solutions for customer acquisition
  - Personalized omnichannel experiences for leading brands
  - Scalable customer acquisition platform for residential service, insurance, e-commerce,
    and B2B brands
  - Digital experiences reaching 150 million in-market shoppers annually
  - High-performance web applications for business and broadband services
