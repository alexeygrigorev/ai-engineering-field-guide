# From Frontend Engineer to AI Engineer

Frontend engineers follow a similar path as other engineers. AI engineers focus more on the backend, so you would need to build up your backend skills first. But you have a unique advantage: you can close the entire full stack end-to-end.


## What You Already Have

- TypeScript/JavaScript
- React
- Next.js
- API consumption and integration
- UI/UX sensibility - valuable for AI products
- Product sense


## What You Need to Learn

- Backend development - start with TypeScript (you don't need Python initially). FastAPI if you go the Python route
- Databases - PostgreSQL, Redis, vector databases
- Docker, CI/CD
- Cloud platforms - AWS, Azure, GCP
- LLM APIs - OpenAI, Anthropic. Structured outputs, function calling
- Prompt engineering
- RAG patterns - vector search, embeddings, retrieval
- Agent patterns - LLMs with tools, orchestration
- Evaluation - test sets, LLM-as-judge, quality metrics
- Basic ML concepts - embeddings, fine-tuning concepts


## Why This Transition Works

Instead of Python, it is perfectly fine to use TypeScript. There are plenty of AI engineering jobs that require TypeScript and plenty of projects built in TypeScript.

From frontend, you can easily transition to full stack. Do backend in TypeScript. Once you have backend and full stack experience, add AI on top. Your advantage over other engineers: they cannot do what you can - you can close the entire full stack end-to-end, from writing the backend to integrating it into the product.


## Suggested Path

1. Learn backend - do it in TypeScript. Build APIs, learn databases
2. Learn Docker and basic deployment
3. Pick up an AI assistant (Cursor, Claude Code) - use it to accelerate your backend learning
4. Start with LLM APIs - call OpenAI/Anthropic from your backend
5. Build a full-stack AI app - chatbot, RAG system, or extraction tool. You build both the UI and the backend
6. Learn evaluation - test sets, quality metrics
7. Learn agents - tool use, orchestration


## Timeline

Longer than backend engineers because you need the backend foundation first. But once backend clicks, adding AI is the same path as everyone else.


## Your Advantage

When we talked about who to hire first for an AI team, a full stack person is probably the best candidate. You can build the entire product: the AI backend, the API, and the user interface. Most AI engineers cannot do frontend well. This makes you uniquely valuable, especially at startups and smaller teams.

Don't forget about AI tools. Start with Cursor or Claude Code - pick any AI assistant and try doing backend with its help. Once backend clicks, start learning AI.
