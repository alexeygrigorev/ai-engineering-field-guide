# From Data Scientist to AI Engineer

Data scientists and ML engineers are excellent future AI engineers. The evaluation mindset that data scientists have is one of the most valuable skills in AI engineering. The main gap is on the engineering side.


## What You Already Have

- Evaluation and metrics - this is a core AI engineering skill
- Model understanding - embeddings, fine-tuning concepts, ML fundamentals
- Python and data analysis
- Experiment design and A/B testing
- Understanding of model behavior and failure modes
- Data-driven decision making


## What You Need to Learn

- Engineering best practices - tests, CI/CD, code quality
- Production deployment - Docker, FastAPI, REST APIs
- Cloud platforms - AWS, Azure, GCP
- Kubernetes and container orchestration
- LLM APIs - OpenAI, Anthropic (different from training your own models)
- RAG patterns - vector databases, retrieval
- Agent patterns - LLMs with tools, orchestration
- Monitoring in production (not just notebook metrics)


## Why This Transition Works

AI engineers need to do both the science and engineering parts, but there is no real modeling since the model already exists. Most effort goes to prompt tuning. For data scientists, evaluation is a very familiar concept. For software engineers, evaluation takes a few times of doing it before it clicks. You already have this advantage.

AI engineers and data scientists often work in the same teams. Where there are no AI engineers, data scientists typically cover those AI engineering needs. The skills needed are skills you already have - you just need to add the engineering rigor.


## Suggested Path

1. Learn software engineering fundamentals - testing, CI/CD, Git workflows, code review
2. Learn Docker and deployment basics - get comfortable with containerization
3. Start with LLM APIs - calling OpenAI/Anthropic, structured outputs, prompt engineering
4. Build a RAG system with proper evaluation - this combines your eval skills with new AI patterns
5. Add production skills - monitoring, logging, FastAPI
6. Learn agents - LLMs with tools, orchestration frameworks


## The Hard Truth

Data scientists who can only do analytics, only train models, and don't go beyond notebooks - the trend is that it has been hard for them for quite a while already. A single request to gpt-4o-mini can replace many traditional modeling tasks.

But if you add engineering skills, you will be fine. Full-stack data scientists and generalists have never had problems finding work and likely never will. Whatever they are called - data scientist, AI engineer - they can do anything and adapt quickly.


## Your Advantage

Evaluation is the emerging differentiator. Anyone can build a chatbot. Companies hire people who can measure if it works. LLM-as-judge, golden datasets, hallucination detection, drift monitoring - this is what separates candidates. You already think this way.
