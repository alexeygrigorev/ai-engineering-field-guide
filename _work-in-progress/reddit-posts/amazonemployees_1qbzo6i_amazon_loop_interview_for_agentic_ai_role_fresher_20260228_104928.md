## Post Body

Hi everyone,

I’m a **fresher (2025 graduate)** with **2 internships** (one in full-stack development and one as an AI trainer). I recently applied for the **Agentic AI role at Amazon**, and I’ve been **progressed to the Loop Interview** 

I’ve been reading about Amazon’s Leadership Principles and STAR method, but I’m a bit confused about **how many stories I should realistically prepare**.

* Is **1 story per Leadership Principle** enough?
* Or should I have **2–3 stories that can be reused across multiple principles**?
* For a fresher with internships, what’s the **safe number of strong stories** to prepare?

Would really appreciate advice from anyone who has gone through an Amazon loop interview (especially freshers or early-career candidates).

Thanks in advance! 🙏

Easier to remember using note cards with one story for each LP.

I had 20 stories prepared and each story had multiple LPs. TBH, 20 was just the right amount.

I prepared 10 total stories that each covered two or three LPs each. Depending on what I was asked, I was able to pivot my story to fit the LP they were looking for. Try not to use the same story more than once. If you use one twice it is usually fine, but you don't want to use the same few stories multiple times. I'm guessing you'll be asked 6 LP questions total, since you're a recent grad. Also, I believe the question bank for the LP questions is floating around. I don't remember exactly where I found it, but I recommend you look for it, and practice with them.

It's very likely you'll be asked to reflect on the situation in your story (ie: how would you have done that differently, what would you do next time to avoid xyz), and you need to be prepared for that.

Once I knew which LP they were after, I picked a story that made sense. I also crossed off that story from my list so I wouldn't reuse it when asked another LP question.

Don't let it throw you off. Just go with it. I think having organized reference points and key phrases is probably the way to go opposed to having a script. It is useful when you get the probe questions, as they can come at anytime while you are giving your response. Practice giving an answer out loud.

I suggest two stories per LP.
