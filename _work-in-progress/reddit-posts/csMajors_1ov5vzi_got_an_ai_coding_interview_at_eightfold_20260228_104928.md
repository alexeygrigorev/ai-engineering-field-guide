## Post Body

I applied for the agentic AI intern position at eightfold.ai a month ago.
Today i received a mail from the University recruitment team regarding an AI coding interview.
They said that the interview typically consists of 2 coding questions conducted by their AI agent and the interview will be over in an hour.
Any advice, what should I revise, as it's an agentic AI intern position should I touch up my ML or DSA?

If you're nervous about an AI coding interview, practice on timed problems and record explanations of your approach; some hires came through ZipRecruiter and their Smart Matching flagged candidates who explained reasoning well. Focus on clear thought process and edge cases.

these AI-run interviews are confusing at first, i remember not knowing what to expect either. for me the hard part wasn’t the question, it was explaining my thinking clearly to a system. i tried a few practice tools just to get used to that flow and played with ShadeCoder briefly to rehearse reasoning out loud. it at least made the format feel less weird.

Guys, did anyone hear back after submitting the assignment? I ended up turning it in about 4 hours late, so yeah... probably ngmi.
That said, the google form is still open, so not sure if deadlines are soft or I’m just coping.

My Update -   
got 2 coding question both medium leetcode (LinkedList in my case)  
AI presented me the 1st question , also read it out then got  time to read it again and go through the examples ... then need to explain the approach , edge cases, T.C, S.C and then start code   
after the code AI will tell u to walkthrough the code using any example and then we need to explain that in detail it if, AI passes it then same things goes on for Question 2

Given it’s two coding questions in an hour, I’d lean DSA over ML, imo. When I did agent-style interviews, it was leetcode medium stuff on graphs, strings, DP, then a quick complexity check. What helped me was running 45 min timed mocks and talking through brute force, then the optimization before typing. I used Beyz coding assistant with prompts from the IQB interview question bank to keep pace and cut filler. Refresh BFS/DFS, sliding window, binary search, prefix sums, and be ready to unit test edge cases out loud. Keep explanations tight, like 6090 seconds per idea. You’ll be fine, good luck.

> > 
> > Yeah, to be clear I did not use Beyz coding assistant during the actual interview - only for practice beforehand. I’d treat the real thing like any other OA and assume they could flag weird copy/paste or long idle gaps, so it’s not worth the risk. Use tools while you prep, not live.  
> > 
> > I can’t share the exact wording of the questions, but the flow for me was: brief intro from the agent, 2 LeetCode-style mediums (graphs/strings in my case), follow-ups on complexity and edge cases, then 1 short behavioral about teamwork/ownership. I prepped by replaying that pattern with IQB interview question bank beforehand. I know it feels high-stakes, but if you stay calm and talk through your thinking, you’ll be okay.

UPDATE: GOT 2 MEDIUM DSA QUESTIONS.
My AI interviewer was very rigid and was trying to ask me questions about my implementation.
It wasn't exactly hard, but due to this being an AI interview, we just write code here on their given input space, with no option to run it.
The code will be run and evaluated after the interview, so that's kind of a bummer that you don't get to change any part of your code like minor tweaks that would make it work.
Thats it, the AI interviewer felt robotic, but could have been much worse.

I had the AI interview today for the same role. As I logged in, the AI greeted me. When I greeted back and asked a question, it did not reply back. Confused if it was an audio issue on my end, I clicked the troubleshoot button which asked me to refresh the page and re-enter. This happened twice, following which, now it shows the interview has ended. Disappointed with the experience :(
