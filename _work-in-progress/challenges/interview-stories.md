## Key Themes from These Stories

### Common Interview Formats (2025-2026)
1. **"Vibe Coding"** - Live coding with AI assistance allowed (or expected)
2. **System Design Focus** - Less API trivia, more architectural decisions
3. **RAG Implementations** - Building document Q&A systems
4. **Agentic Systems** - Multi-step reasoning with tools
5. **Take-Home Projects** - 2-5 day assignments with presentation

### What Candidates Wish They Knew
1. **LLM APIs matter** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini familiarity is expected
2. **LangGraph over LangChain** - Companies prefer LangGraph for complex workflows
3. **Production concerns** - Error handling, latency, cost optimization matter more than demo code
4. **System design over model knowledge** - "Why" approaches work > "How" to implement

### Common Pain Points
1. **Unreasonable time constraints** - Building "production-grade" RAG in 24-48 hours
2. **Tool requirements** - Being rejected for not using specific frameworks (LangChain/LangGraph)
3. **Ghosting** - Completing take-homes and never hearing back
4. **Scope creep** - Simple assignments becoming full-stack projects
