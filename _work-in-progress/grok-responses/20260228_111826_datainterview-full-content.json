The article describes expected topics and provides sample answers but no exact questions from interviews.[[1]](https://www.datainterview.com/blog/openai-ai-engineer-interview)\n\n- **First-person experience or prep guide?**: Primarily a preparation guide with advice, tips, common pitfalls, and sample responses. No first-person personal interview experience described.[[1]](https://www.datainterview.com/blog/openai-ai-engineer-interview)\n\n- **Details about the interview process**: 9 rounds total over ~10 weeks. Initial screen (2 rounds: narrative/project discussion, likely virtual). Technical assessment (3 rounds: coding, system design, ML/LLM concepts). Onsite (4 rounds: presentation, coding, system design, behavioral). Interviewers are engineers who ship features like ChatGPT/Codex.[[1]](https://www.datainterview.com/blog/openai-ai-engineer-interview)\n\n- **Key topics covered**: LLMs/RAG/AI Agents; ML System Design & MLOps; Coding & Algorithms (Python); ML/Deep Learning/Statistics; Cloud Infrastructure & Serving; SQL/Data Retrieval; Behavioral/Forward-Deployed Execution.[[1]](https://www.datainterview.com/blog/openai-ai-engineer-interview)\n\n### Article 2: Mistral Machine Learning Engineer Interview (https://www.datainterview.com/blog/mistral-machine-learning-engineer-interview)[[2]](https://www.datainterview.com/blog/mistral-machine-learning-engineer-interview)\n\n- **All specific interview questions listed** (presented as practice samples, not verbatim candidate experiences):\n  - Machine Learning Fundamentals: \"Why might accuracy increase while log loss stalls?\"; \"Explain the gradient of logistic regression with L2 regularization.\"; (Implied) \"Why use log loss vs. PR AUC under class imbalance?\"\n  - Deep Learning: \"How to debug a deep learning training run that isn't converging?\"; \"What is RMSNorm and how does it differ from LayerNorm? What bugs can occur?\"; (Implied) \"Explain RoPE and common bugs in implementation.\"\n  - LLMs & AI Agents: \"How to debug a RAG chatbot that gives confident but wrong answers?\"; \"How to secure an AI agent system handling tools and secrets?\"\n  - ML Coding: Implement stratified K-fold splitting; Implement logistic regression with SGD/L2/early stopping in NumPy; Implement top-p (nucleus) sampling; Implement autoregressive generation with top-p; Specific prompt: \"Implement a function that samples one token id from a 1D array of logits using temperature scaling, optional top_k filtering, and optional top_p (nucleus) filtering...\"\n  - ML System Design: Design RAG system; Design cost/safety-aware AI agent framework.\n  - MLOps/Cloud: \"How to scale LLM inference service under high concurrency?\"; \"How to debug a sudden spike in latency or errors post-deployment?\"\n  - Behavioral: \"Tell me about a time you debugged a production ML issue.\"; \"Describe a situation where you had competing priorities\u2014how did you decide?\"; \"Tell me about a time you identified a major risk in an AI system\u2014what did you do?\"[[2]](https://www.datainterview.com/blog/mistral-machine-learning-engineer-interview)\n\n- **First-person experience or prep guide?**: Primarily a preparation guide based on candidate reports and insights, with structured advice, samples, and tips. No first-person personal experience.[[2]](https://www.datainterview.com/blog/mistral-machine-learning-engineer-interview)\n\n- **Details about the interview process**: 6 rounds total over ~6 weeks (faster possible). Initial screen (2 virtual/phone rounds). Take-home (1 coding assignment). Onsite (3 technical deep dives: modeling/coding, design, behavioral; primarily in-person at Paris office, some virtual). Interviewers: ML engineers, modeling experts, possibly research/product.[[2]](https://www.datainterview.com/blog/mistral-machine-learning-engineer-interview)\n\n- **Key topics covered**: ML Fundamentals; Deep Learning; LLMs/AI Agents (incl. MoE, attention); ML Coding (NumPy/Python); ML System Design; MLOps/Cloud Infrastructure; Behavioral (ambiguity, ownership).[[2]](https://www.datainterview.com/blog/mistral-machine-learning-engineer-interview)",
