  "grok_conclusion": "Reports are emerging but sparse. Agentic AI roles (e.g., Amazon, Eightfold) surged in late 2025, often with assignments over verbal questions. No X posts matched first-person candidate experiences with specific phrasing. Multi-agent specifics were rare; 'agentic AI experience' or distinctions were common."
