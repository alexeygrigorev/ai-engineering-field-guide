# Awesome AI Engineering

Curated collection of resources for AI engineering: practitioner stories, system design guides, company engineering blogs, books, courses, and case studies.

This is the list of resources I used while researching content for the [AI Engineering Field Guide](README.md). The collection turned out to be so useful that I decided to publish it separately.
