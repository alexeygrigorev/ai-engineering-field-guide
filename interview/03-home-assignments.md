# Home Assignments Analysis: AI Engineering Job Market

Analysis of take-home assignments, paid work trials, and asynchronous assessments extracted from 1,765 AI/ML engineering job descriptions.

See also: [Interview Process Report](01-interview-process.md) for the full interview process analysis including company-by-company breakdowns, common patterns, and notable practices.

## Overview

Of the 51 companies with disclosed interview processes, 17 (33%) include a take-home or asynchronous assignment. An additional 5 companies use paid work trials instead of traditional assignments. Only 1 company (TensorOps) explicitly states they do not use take-homes.

## Key Observations

### Format Trends
- Realistic/applied work is the dominant philosophy. Column Tax says "not code golf," boam uses "a real Boam-style ML/AI challenge," Melotech uses "real-world projects," FlowFuse offers building an AI feature or contributing actual code.
- No company uses generic algorithmic puzzles as take-homes. All assignments are applied/domain-specific.
- Choice-based assignments are growing: FlowFuse lets candidates choose between building something new or contributing a PR; Monzo Bank offers a choice between take-home and pair coding; Qonto offers remote or live exercise.
- Most companies provide minimal detail about what the assignment actually involves - only Column Tax, FlowFuse, boam, Melotech, and Qonto describe the content in any detail.

### Time Investment
- Only 2 companies specify duration: Column Tax (~3 hours) and FlowFuse (2-3 hours, time-boxed).
- The remaining 15 companies do not disclose expected time, creating uncertainty for candidates.
- Paid work trials range from 1 day (PostHog) to 1 week (Fifth Dimension, Infinity Constellation) to 3 months (CompuGroup Medical US internship).

### Compensation
- 5 companies (PostHog, Lorikeet, Infinity Constellation, Fifth Dimension, CompuGroup Medical US) explicitly pay candidates for assessment time.
- FlowFuse explicitly states theirs is unpaid.
- The remaining 13 companies don't mention compensation (likely unpaid).

### AI Tool Policies for Assignments
- 1 company explicitly allows AI (FlowFuse: "AI tools are explicitly allowed and encouraged")
- 0 companies explicitly ban AI in take-home assignments specifically (bans from Wolters Kluwer and HRT apply to live interviews)
- 16 companies don't mention AI tool policy for their assignments - a significant gap given the prevalence of AI coding assistants

### Placement in the Process
- Most assignments come after an initial screen (step 2-3 of the process)
- Melotech is unique: the case study is step 1 - candidates start with the assignment before any calls
- Monzo Bank places the take-home/pair coding at step 4, after a system design interview
- hyperexponential combines the take-home with the interview discussion in a single stage
- Stacks combines the take-home with the onsite panel

### How Assignments Are Evaluated
- Dedicated walkthrough (5 companies): Lendable, FlowFuse, Melotech, hyperexponential, and Monzo Bank all have a follow-up interview to discuss the assignment
- Team review (2 companies): Tenex has engineers review the submission before deciding on final round; Stacks combines with panel
- Presentation to leadership (2 companies): Roboflow candidates present to the CTO; Melotech candidates present and debate results
- C-suite review (1 company): Wing Assistant follows the technical task with a final interview with CEO, CPO & CTO
- Not specified (7 companies): Harmonic, Zeely, SmartAssets, boam, Qonto, Hastings Direct, and Lendable (new role) don't describe how the assignment is evaluated

### Companies That Explicitly Don't Use Take-Homes
- TensorOps - "This interview does not involve live coding or a take-home assignment"
- Glass Health - All rounds are live (no take-home)
- Clarium - Live realistic exercises with info sent in advance (no async work)
- Phare Health - Explicitly "not Leetcode," all rounds live (pseudo-coding + systems design)
