  Here's a research plan for that topic. If you need to update it, let me know!
AI Engineering Jobs Search

Research Websites

(1) Identify top-tier job aggregators and specialized tech career platforms that list artificial intelligence and machine learning engineering roles in the United States, European Union, and United Kingdom.
(2) Search for AI Engineering and Machine Learning Engineering positions in the United States posted within the last 14 days on these aggregators.
(3) Search for AI Engineering and Machine Learning Engineering positions in the European Union, including major hubs like Berlin, Germany, posted within the last 14 days.
(4) Search for AI Engineering and Machine Learning Engineering positions in the United Kingdom posted within the last 14 days.
(5) For each regional search, find at least 5-10 specific job listings that are highly relevant to AI engineering.
(6) For every job listing found, extract the following details:
   (a) Exact job title
   (b) Hiring company name
   (c) Specific location and whether it allows for remote work
   (d) Date the job was posted
   (e) Direct URL link to the job listing or application page
(7) Synthesize the collected information into a structured list organized by region (US, EU, UK) to provide a clear overview of the most recent opportunities.

AI Engineering Job Postings Aggregation

Research Websites

(1) Identify top-tier job aggregators (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor) and specialized tech job boards (e.g., Otta, Wellfound) for the US, EU, and UK markets.
(2) Conduct high-volume searches for AI Engineering and Machine Learning Engineering positions in the United States posted within the last 14 days.
(3) Conduct high-volume searches for AI Engineering and Machine Learning Engineering positions in the European Union (focusing on hubs like Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam) posted within the last 14 days.
(4) Conduct high-volume searches for AI Engineering and Machine Learning Engineering positions in the United Kingdom posted within the last 14 days.
(5) Extract specific details for each role: Job Title, Hiring Company, Location, Date Posted, and direct URL.
(6) Aggregate the findings to compile a comprehensive list of approximately 80-90 positions per region to meet the total requirement of 250 positions.
(7) Verify the URLs to ensure they lead directly to job descriptions or application portals.
(8) Synthesize the 250 listings into a structured report organized by region (US, EU, UK) for clear navigation.
