I have read the book released by the google engineer on design patterns, read architecture posts by AWS and Google, etc\n\nWhat else should I do to get super familiar with systems design interview for agentic AI? This is my first systems design interview and I am very nervous and really do not want to mess anything up.\n\nThank you in advance.",

What should it NOT see? How do you prevent it from going off-rails? I've been building plugins that let agents directly control game engines (Unity, Godot, Unreal) and the architecture boils down to: clear tool definitions, strict context files, and always server-authoritative. The \"agentic\" part is just a loop with guardrails.",

      "body": "The fundamentals remain the same - clarify requirements, identify constraints, design components, discuss trade-offs, and show how you'd scale it. For agentic AI specifically, they want to see how you handle orchestration layers between agents, state management across async workflows, failure recovery when agents make poor decisions, and how you'd monitor and log complex multi-agent interactions. Focus on demonstrating strong distributed systems knowledge rather than trying to memorize AI-specific patterns - things like message queues, event-driven architectures, circuit breakers, and idempotency are what matter most. They're testing if you can build reliable systems that happen to use AI agents, not if you can recite the latest AI framework docs.\n\nThe good news is that staff-level systems design interviews are more about showing your thinking process and asking smart questions than having perfect answers. Talk through your reasoning out loud, acknowledge trade-offs explicitly, and don't be afraid to say \"here's what I'd need to investigate further\" when you hit uncertainty. Most interviewers would rather see you identify a problem and propose how you'd research it than watch you confidently architect something brittle. If you want more practice with technical interviews under pressure, I built [AI interview assistant](http://interviews.chat) with my team - it's helped a bunch of people get more comfortable thinking on their feet during these conversations.",

Interviewers at the staff level want to hear you reason about failure modes, not recite the textbook.\n\n\n\nSo like, if they ask you to design a customer support agent \u2014 don't just say \"RAG pipeline with guardrails.\" Talk about what happens when the retrieval step returns semantically similar but factually wrong documents. Talk about how you'd handle the agent confidently hallucinating a refund policy that doesn't exist. Talk about latency budgets because real users won't wait 30 seconds for your chain-of-thought to finish.\n\n\n\nThe HIL pattern everyone mentions is basically \"have a human check the output sometimes.\" That's it. But the interesting part is deciding WHEN to trigger it. Cost vs risk tradeoff. You can't have a human review every response and you can't skip review on high-stakes actions. That decision logic is where the actual design challenge lives, not in the pattern itself.",

But if you have similar negative feedback for different offramps in 20 different cities, there is a pattern your initial design did not account for. You can evaluate characteristics like all have sharp 40+ degree turning angle with an avg posted highway of 70mph. You determine the turns are too sharp and risky vis-a-vis posted speed in your weekly data reporting review and update the safety agent based on those findings. Your weekly cadence of reviewing that is also HIL as you are making a call to change your system.\n\nThumbs Up & Thumbs down buttons in a UI is the mechanism to capture that HIL. How you harvest the data to retrain, adapt the behavior is the outcome of HIL.\n\nAll AI and AI adjacent systems should have HIL built in and considered.\n\n",

Do not capture personal data and ensure no financial advice is given. Capture any potential PII and ensure no PII goes to a LLM.\n\nSo this creates a lot of problemd and is very simple on the surface but the dangers lie beneath. As customers will randomly say things outsie the scope of the chatbot. People will provide personal data. They will ask how to reinvest their $100k CD into which investment vehicle,etc. So testing will involve jail breaking. They may ask for what type of services favor certain minorities or political affiliation. All those things need to be guard rails. And you CANNOT store any PII if they slip it in.  \n  \nNo PII meands you need some resolver, interceptor service that filters everything as the bank doesnt want customer data to go to OpenAI or Claude models. You need to audit exceptions.  \nNext, the no \"financial advice\" means you need to develop jail breaking or sandbox HIL testing.  \n\n\nOut of 30 people I've interviewed, only 4 or 5 have actual design experience in this realm.
