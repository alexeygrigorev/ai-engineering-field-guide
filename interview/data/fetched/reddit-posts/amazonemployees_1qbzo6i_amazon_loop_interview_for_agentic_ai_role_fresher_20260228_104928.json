    "title": "Amazon Loop Interview for Agentic AI role (Fresher) \u2013 how many stories should I prepare?",
    "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI\u2019m a **fresher (2025 graduate)** with **2 internships** (one in full-stack development and one as an AI trainer). I recently applied for the **Agentic AI role at Amazon**, and I\u2019ve been **progressed to the Loop Interview** \n\nI\u2019ve been reading about Amazon\u2019s Leadership Principles and STAR method, but I\u2019m a bit confused about **how many stories I should realistically prepare**.\n\n* Is **1 story per Leadership Principle** enough?\n* Or should I have **2\u20133 stories that can be reused across multiple principles**?\n* For a fresher with internships, what\u2019s the **safe number of strong stories** to prepare?\n\nWould really appreciate advice from anyone who has gone through an Amazon loop interview (especially freshers or early-career candidates).\n\nThanks in advance! \ud83d\ude4f",
