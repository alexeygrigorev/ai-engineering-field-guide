    "selftext": "Hi all,  \nI finished my final interview round for an Amazon Agentic AI role on Thursday (22nd Jan) and currently in the waiting phase\n\nI\u2019ve heard this is a mass hiring drive, and some people are still interviewing next week. \n\nFor those who\u2019ve been through Amazon interviews recently:\n\n* How long did it take to get a response?\n* Is it normal for Amazon to wait till all interviews are done?\n* Does Amazon always inform candidates if they are rejected, or is there sometimes no response?\n\nAnd would love to connect with the people who are in my exact situation for this role.\n\nAny insights or personal experiences would really help. Thanks!",
