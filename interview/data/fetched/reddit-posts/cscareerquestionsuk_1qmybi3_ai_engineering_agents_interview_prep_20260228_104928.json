      "body": "You need to focus on understanding agent architectures, tool calling, and the orchestration patterns that make agents actually work in production. Go deep on ReAct (Reasoning and Acting), chain-of-thought prompting, and how agents break down complex tasks into subtasks. Be ready to discuss real tradeoffs - when agents are overkill versus when they shine, how you handle error recovery and looping, and what observability looks like when your AI is making autonomous decisions. Study LangChain or similar frameworks not to memorize their APIs, but to understand the design patterns they encode. Most importantly, have opinions on agent reliability and how you'd prevent them from going off the rails in production scenarios.\n\nThe interviewer will likely throw you a system design question about building an agent for a specific use case, so practice articulating how you'd architect the prompt flow, which tools you'd give the agent access to, and how you'd evaluate its performance. They want to see you think through the messy reality of agents - context window management, cost control, latency constraints, and failure modes. Be prepared to code some basic agent logic or prompt engineering on the spot, even if it's pseudocode. If you want help with these types of technical questions and figuring out how to structure your answers on the fly, I built [interview AI copilot](http://interviews.chat) to respond to tricky questions like these in real-time.",
