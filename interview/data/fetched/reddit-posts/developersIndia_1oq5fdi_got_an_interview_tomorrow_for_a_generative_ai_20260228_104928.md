## Post Body

I’ve got an interview tomorrow for a **Generative AI Engineer** role — the position focuses on building **agentic systems**, **LLM integrations**, **fine-tuning**, and **RAG pipelines**. The company works with models like GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5, and wants hands-on experience with **prompt engineering, Python, API development**, and **AI app pipelines**.

I’ve been prepping the fundamentals (transformers, embeddings, vector DBs, RAG flow, agents, etc.), but I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been through similar interviews recently —

* What kind of **technical or conceptual questions** do they dig deep into? (e.g., how RAG retrieval works, prompt optimization logic, model fine-tuning steps?)
* Any **tricky or unexpected parts** you faced in LLM or agentic system interviews?
* How can I best **show practical experience** (projects, workflows, system design) rather than just theory?
* Anything specific about **APIs / production integration / scaling LLM apps** I should be ready for?

Would really appreciate any quick last-minute tips or key areas to revise tonight. 🙏

How did it go

I would ask the following questions 

on the math side; 

\-> Explain chain rule, matmul, and softmax. 

\-> Loss functions and Gradient descent and Maybe throwin a couple of calculus questions. 

\-> Why is GPU faster than CPU? 

On the AI side 

\-> Can be tell me how tokenizing works? 

\-> Maybe a flops question? 

\-> Estimate the budget for a RAG pipeline for a document set of 300000 legal contracts (I was asked this question). Can you build a QA system for that. 

Gen AI System Design 

\-> For a system that is based on a corpus "C", explain

A. how would you go about training vs validation split? 

B. Does decreasing LR 

C. Suppose training plateau's at CLR X. How do we know how to fix it? 

D. When and How we know learning plateaus. 

E. Is it better to wait for all epochs or quit early? If optimizing, justify your answer. 

F. My favorite question- Did you apply Gen AI techniques to solve a problem that is not usually solved with Gen AI? 

Tie breaker question -> Did you try to solve the physics for AI question? What, in your opinion, the reason behind AI not understanding physics?
