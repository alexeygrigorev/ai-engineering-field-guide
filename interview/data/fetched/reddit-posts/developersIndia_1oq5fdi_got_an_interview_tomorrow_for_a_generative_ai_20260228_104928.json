    "title": "Got an interview tomorrow for a Generative AI Engineer (Agentic + RAG + API dev) \u2014 what should I keep in mind?",
    "selftext": "I\u2019ve got an interview tomorrow for a **Generative AI Engineer** role \u2014 the position focuses on building **agentic systems**, **LLM integrations**, **fine-tuning**, and **RAG pipelines**. The company works with models like GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5, and wants hands-on experience with **prompt engineering, Python, API development**, and **AI app pipelines**.\n\nI\u2019ve been prepping the fundamentals (transformers, embeddings, vector DBs, RAG flow, agents, etc.), but I\u2019d love to hear from anyone who\u2019s been through similar interviews recently \u2014\n\n* What kind of **technical or conceptual questions** do they dig deep into? (e.g., how RAG retrieval works, prompt optimization logic, model fine-tuning steps?)\n* Any **tricky or unexpected parts** you faced in LLM or agentic system interviews?\n* How can I best **show practical experience** (projects, workflows, system design) rather than just theory?\n* Anything specific about **APIs / production integration / scaling LLM apps** I should be ready for?\n\nWould really appreciate any quick last-minute tips or key areas to revise tonight. \ud83d\ude4f",

I could be wrong in listing my questions; **You are right,** they're mostly about building models**.**  Instead of criticizing me, why wont you **just help** OP with some questions he needs to prep? \n\nI am not saying you are wrong- but please look for ways to add value to the conversations :). \n\nNow- You are an ML engineer- can you help me with some questions to become an ML engineer?",
