    "selftext": "So I have an upcoming interview for an AI Engineer role at a start-up. The role is very agent-heavy (multi-agent orchestration, evaluation/safety, RAG + monitoring/observability).\n\nI\u2019m comfortable with \u201cold-school\u201d deep learning engineering (LLM internals, benchmarking, production), but I\u2019m much less experienced in the agentic world. I know the basics (tool calling, prompts, simple planners), and I\u2019ve played a bit with LangGraph / CrewAI. I\u2019ve also built a stable \u201cRalph loop\u201d-style iterative agent loop for building small apps, but I\u2019m not even sure if that term is something people use seriously outside of social media/niche circles.\n\nWhat are the core concepts I should read up on to not sound junior on agentic systems?\n\nSpecifically:\n\n* What are common **metrics/benchmarks** for agent quality (task success, safety, etc.)?\n* What **interview questions** show up for agentic roles, and what does a \u201cgood\u201d answer usually cover?\n* What are the **foundational papers** that shaped modern agent workflows (the \u201cmust know\u201d set)?\n* Any **resources** that go beyond intros and focus on evaluation, scaling, and real-world failure modes?\n\nInterview-specific tips or real-world anecdotes about agentic AI are also appreciated; even short replies or a couple of links are super helpful. Thanks.",

      "body": "For your upcoming interview focused on agentic systems, here are some key areas to study and resources to consider:\n\n### Core Concepts to Study\n- **Agent Quality Metrics**:\n  - Familiarize yourself with agent-specific metrics such as:\n    - Tool Selection Quality: Evaluates if the correct tools and arguments were chosen.\n    - Action Advancement: Measures progress toward the ultimate goal.\n    - Context Adherence: Assesses how well the agent's responses align with the context.\n  - Understanding these metrics will help you discuss agent performance effectively.\n\n- **Common Interview Questions**:\n  - Be prepared for questions that assess your understanding of multi-agent systems, orchestration, and evaluation. Examples include:\n    - How do you ensure reliability in agent workflows?\n    - Can you explain the role of orchestration in multi-agent systems?\n    - What strategies would you use to evaluate agent performance?\n  - A good answer should demonstrate a clear understanding of concepts, practical applications, and possibly reference specific metrics or frameworks.\n\n- **Foundational Papers**:\n  - Look into seminal works that have influenced agent workflows and architectures. Key papers might include:\n    - Research on multi-agent systems and their coordination.\n    - Papers discussing reinforcement learning in the context of agent training.\n    - Studies on evaluation frameworks for AI agents.\n\n- **Advanced Resources**:\n  - Seek out materials that delve into evaluation, scaling, and real-world challenges in agentic AI. Some useful resources include:\n    - Articles on agent evaluation frameworks and metrics.\n    - Case studies on deploying agentic systems in production environments.\n    - Documentation and tutorials on platforms like LangGraph and CrewAI that focus on advanced agent capabilities.\n\n### Relevant Resources\n- For metrics and evaluation frameworks, check out [Introducing Agentic Evaluations - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3zymprct).\n- For practical insights into building and evaluating agents, consider [Mastering Agents: Build And Evaluate A Deep Research Agent with o3 and 4o - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd).\n- Explore [AI agent orchestration with OpenAI Agents SDK](https://tinyurl.com/3axssjh3) for understanding orchestration in multi-agent systems.\n\n### Interview Tips\n- Be ready to discuss your hands-on experience with tools like LangGraph and CrewAI, and how you've applied them in projects.\n- Share anecdotes about challenges you've faced in building agentic systems and how you overcame them.\n- Highlight your understanding of the importance of evaluation and monitoring in ensuring agent reliability and performance.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, you'll be well-prepared to discuss agentic systems in depth during your interview. Good luck!",
