## Akshay Shinde - LLD Interview Prep for AI Engineers
**URL:** https://x.com/ConsciousRide/status/2015695661996630201
**Summary:** Akshay Shinde outlines eight critical focus areas and five key artifact types for AI engineers preparing for Low-Level Design (LLD) interviews. The post adapts traditional backend engineering LLD frameworks specifically for AI/ML engineering roles.
**Interview Questions Mentioned:**
- Model architecture and selection design questions
- Data pipeline design questions
- Inference optimization and serving scenarios
**Key Insights:**
- Eight focus areas: model architecture/selection, data pipeline design, feature engineering/preprocessing, inference optimization/serving, model versioning/A/B testing, monitoring/drift detection, fallback mechanisms/error handling, training/evaluation workflows
- Five artifacts to prepare: ML system architecture diagrams, data flow diagrams, model serving infrastructure design, feature store schemas, evaluation metrics and monitoring dashboards

## Dan Shipper - Reimagining Technical Interviews with AI Agents
**URL:** https://x.com/danshipper/status/2014796845575180553
**Summary:** Dan Shipper, CEO of Every, proposes a three-stage technical interview format that evaluates candidates on their ability to collaborate with AI agents. The process involves building a feature independently with an AI agent, submitting a PR with documentation and agent session records, then discussing the decisions made during a phone conversation.
**Interview Questions Mentioned:**
- Build a feature using your AI agent of choice on your own time
- Submit a PR, a Loom recording, and the record of your agent sessions
- Phone discussion evaluating how you interact with AI and answer questions
**Key Insights:**
- AI-human collaboration is being positioned as a core professional skill to evaluate in interviews
- Traditional solo coding interviews may become obsolete
- Evaluating the decision-making process with AI tools (prompt engineering, agent guidance) matters as much as the output
- Recording agent sessions provides transparency into the candidate's working process

## InterviewStack.io - Meta AI Engineer LoRA Interview Question
**URL:** https://x.com/gnan54796/status/2007302142550565123
**Summary:** InterviewStack.io shares a Meta AI Engineer interview question on pre-training and fine-tuning, specifically focused on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The question probes deep understanding of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, from mathematical formulation to practical memory benefits.
**Interview Questions Mentioned:**
- Explain the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique for parameter-efficient fine-tuning at a high level
- Describe the mathematical intuition behind the W + BA formulation
- Explain where adapters are applied in transformer blocks
- Discuss why LoRA reduces training memory versus full fine-tuning
**Key Insights:**
- Meta interviews test deep understanding of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods
- Candidates are expected to explain both the mathematical formulation (W + BA decomposition) and practical implications
- Understanding memory efficiency tradeoffs (frozen pre-trained weights + small adapter matrices) is essential

## Gokul Rajaram - Universal AI Interview Question for All Candidates
**URL:** https://x.com/gokulr/status/1883273169001406928
**Summary:** Gokul Rajaram proposes a two-part AI-focused question that should be asked of every candidate regardless of role: (a) How will you use AI to make your job more effective? (b) What steps have you already taken to learn about AI tools in your field? He argues that poor answers should be disqualifying even if the candidate excels elsewhere.
**Interview Questions Mentioned:**
- "How will you use AI to make your job more effective?"
- "What steps have you already taken to learn about AI tools in your field?"
**Key Insights:**
- The question evaluates five dimensions: proactive technology engagement, practical AI understanding, productivity enhancement perspective, learning agility, and strategic workflow thinking
- Strong answers show specific tool experimentation, realistic role-tailored applications, and self-directed learning
- Weak answers include vague "AI is the future" statements, no hands-on experimentation, or unrealistic expectations
- Rajaram advocates this should be a decisive factor -- poor scores should potentially lead to rejection regardless of other qualifications
