## What Is Your Interview Assignment for AI Engineers? (r/ycombinator)

What is your Interview Assignment for AI engineers ?
How do you evaluate an engineer AI skills? What kind of interview assignments or exercises do you use?

I’m specifically looking for engineers who can build AI agents using LLMs, multi-agent frameworks, LLM observability tools, evals, and so on. I’m not really looking for folks focused on model training or deployment.

If you put a very experienced guy to make 'assiggments' - don't! Someone did that once with me when i only had 10 years experience, but even so, I just said 'thank you, not a fit'. If you look for junior guys - works but best is to make them explain the process and how they go about their process, what models, tools and how they solve the problem. That will tell you more about their analytical skills rather than direct coding. Analysis and how to dissect the problem, using correct tools - that is key for AI agents construction.

Ditto. I won't do assignments as I have been burned spending too much time on them years ago when I was less experienced and got ghosted. I would only consider a paid assistant ($1000+) so that I know the company is not playing games and value my time.

I strongly prefer seeing candidates actually solve a problem vs talk about how they would solve a problem.

Then you probably aren’t a fit for a real company. Why would I pay you if you can’t prove you can do the job? Unless the output is horrendous, I always do a debrief (good or bad) and use it as a time to drill down on the why and understanding thought process and breaking it down.

You are the reason why ageism exists

I find that deep chat reveals a lot, just figure out how they think about designing a system. Ask a particular question like “how would you design ai agent for xyz and what tools would you consider using?”, ask them to draw a diagram of a conceptual architecture of this whole thing and explain it on a very high level.

For that you probably need an interviewer who also knows this stuff though.

I agree with this approach. However, it's important to mention that this approach requires an engineering knowledge to make the right questions. If the OP is non-technical, I don't think this would be the best approach tho.

probably need a technical cofounder/cto or at least a buddy who can do the interviews if you're hiring an AI engineer

nobody worth hiring is doing an assignment for you. they have several recruiters reaching out to them every week. my current role didn't even require me to do a technical round at all, it was purely conversational.

when looking for founding engineers, aim for people who are ambitious and passionate. ideally they have something open-source which is AI oriented. I'd review the project, come up with some technical questions, and have a conversation about it to feel out the depth of their knowledge.

We tend to ask them to create a customer support agent relevant to our product within an hour and a half. Most of them don't seem to start with evals and that's a red flag in the first 10-15 mins as well. But for those who think through its a pretty fascinating discussion.

For system design aspects we get into serving it at scale.

Yeah any time I’ve seen assignments the company was actually just trying to get free work

Why assignment interviews? If you can figure out their skill level through interviews, Put them on the team in a sandbox and see if they can actually do the work. 15 day probation periods, paid work.

it depends on a few factors. If looking for early key hires, you need rockstars and they don’t need assignments since they should have already established that “rockstar” status somehow, i.e open source, previous employment, etc. If you’re trying to scale and hire folks quickly, you will definitely run into some bad apples. I think the issue employers are worried about is trust. Just because someone completed an assignment, they are fit for the job.

I only ask for assignments for junior developers (less than five years of experience). I normally ask them to design a system and send me a one pager. I do encourage them to use ChatGPT (or the like) because they probably will. If I do move them on to the interview stage, I ask them why their solution in the 1 pager will not work.

WTF is AI Engineer? Anyone telling they are hiring AI engineer are in for nasty surprise.

People use LLMs to write code but don't fucking mean anything. AI engineer might as well be called LLM operator.

For AI engineer roles at 16VC, I typically give a short project-based assignment. It might involve building a simple autonomous agent using an open-source LLM, wiring it up with a task-specific goal, and incorporating an observability or eval layer. I look for clarity of thought, modular design, and the ability to explain tradeoffs. Not looking for fine-tuning or infra-heavy work more about smart orchestration and practical agent design.
