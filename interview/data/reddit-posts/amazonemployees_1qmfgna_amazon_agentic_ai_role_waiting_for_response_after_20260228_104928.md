## Post Body

Hi all,  
I finished my final interview round for an Amazon Agentic AI role on Thursday (22nd Jan) and currently in the waiting phase

I’ve heard this is a mass hiring drive, and some people are still interviewing next week. 

For those who’ve been through Amazon interviews recently:

* How long did it take to get a response?
* Is it normal for Amazon to wait till all interviews are done?
* Does Amazon always inform candidates if they are rejected, or is there sometimes no response?

And would love to connect with the people who are in my exact situation for this role.

Any insights or personal experiences would really help. Thanks!

Hey, will they ask questions regarding python , sql etc in the loop interview ? Or does the interview contain only COT, Dealing with Ambiguity, JSOn, csv, markdown and 4 LPs?

Good luck!
Hopefully your HM isn’t laid off tomorrow.
15K folks are being let go this week.

All the best! Let me know if you need any information, but a lot depends on the location. You can DM me for any clarifications.
