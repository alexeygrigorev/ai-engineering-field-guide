## Post Body

Hey everyone,

I had an interview recently where they asked if I had experience with agentic AI. I told them most of my background is in building AI systems from scratch training models, working with architectures like CNNs, experimenting with different approaches, etc.

And the interviewer basically said that building AI from scratch (like implementing and training your own CNN models) is kind of “old-fashioned” now.

That honestly caught me off guard.

I always thought understanding and building models from the ground up was a solid foundation. But now it feels like the industry focus has shifted heavily toward agentic AI, orchestrating LLMs, connecting tools, building multi-agent workflows, using existing foundation models instead of training your own.

So now I’m confused about expectations. When companies ask for “agentic AI experience,” what are they really looking for? Learning specific frameworks? Just knowing how to wire APIs together? Designing autonomous workflows?

If you’re just starting, it helps to focus less on specific tools and more on understanding how agentic workflows work.

Things like task planning, tool usage, and memory systems are usually more important than any single platform. Once you understand those fundamentals, switching between tools becomes much easier.

Sounds like they wanted experience using agent platforms like n8n, zapier, or even general agents like Claude Code.

Apparently no one is capable of separating the idea of model building and automation. 

One is creating a tool… the other is using a tool. 

That interviewer sounds like they have a lot to learn about all this

The interviewer wasn't wrong but they framed it badly. Your foundation is an advantage most people in this space don't have.

The shift is this: agentic AI isn't about building models. It's about using them. You're taking existing LLMs and orchestrating them to do tasks autonomously like manage workflows, make decisions, call tools, interact with other systems, and work toward some organizational goal without a human in the loop for every step.

If training a CNN is like building an engine, Agentic AI is designing the vehicle, the navigation system, and the rules of the road. The industry needs people who can deploy agents, manage their permissions, monitor their behavior, handle failure modes, and design systems where multiple agents coordinate reliably.

Your background in building from scratch means you actually understand what the models are doing when they fail. Most people wiring LangChain together can't say that. Learn how agents are orchestrated in production and you'll be ahead of most people already working in the space.
