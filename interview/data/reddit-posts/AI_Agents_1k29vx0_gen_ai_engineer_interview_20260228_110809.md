## Post Body

Hello,
I have an upcoming gen AI interview from a startup. Wanted to understand what are the questions that I will get w.r.t RAG, AGENTS, CREW AI, and others. If you have any experience attending one pls post your questions. It will be helpful. Thank you.

Context: frontend engineer looking for applied ai engineer job


For such roles in current market with llms rag and all, what should I learn deep learning theory? Like how models trained and tuned? Math heavy

Or actual agent dev using ai tech stack??

I wouldn't ask you about frameworks unless you brought them up, and then I'd ask capabilities and limitations, not implementation

What I would grill you on others haven't mentioned is standard modeling workflow. Gen AI is its own variant of use cases, but it's still probabilistic systems (often stacked). You best be measuring everything.

A lot depends on:

1. The job post, that should give your some major hints.
2. The product(s) the company is working at.

You coould ask chatGPT, feed it the job post and the company name/web site and ask it to come up with possible questions, and best answer for the interview.

YMMV

as someone who owns an agency myself - if you did this i would hire you on the spot - forget the interview

here’s what i would do : 

wrote a python script to scrape their site and the job description. feed that through a model (within the same script) and ask it the most likely questions you might get in an interview ! 

Then talk about about you did to prepare for e interview!!! nothing says i can do this more than actually doing the job - to try and win the job! if you get my meaning. 

This one smalll project proves you can work work with ai, you’re smart enough to use ai in your own workflow and you really want the job - enough to go to these lengths

Learn a bit about Chatbot high level workings (how queries get transformed into embeddings; how retrieval (semantic) search works; how the top k results are fed to LLM

Also, understand grounding the model (avoiding hallucinations), priming with additional data using RAG; learning all about RAG; context lengths

Run through LLMs and SLMs, learn about model parameters such as temperature, penalties; understand through the APIs, learn common models like GPT-4.1, Mistral, Gemini etc

Tony weeny understanding of AI/MLOps might be useful

I am looking mostly to understand what common design choices are there and how they influence ? I am pretty much a newbie to the field but been following tech blogs etc.

You should look first at the job requirements,and then you can conclude the questions
