# After the Interview

What to do after completing the interview process - handling offers, rejections, and negotiations.

## Handling Rejections

Don't take rejections personally. Treat them as learning experiences. Do a retrospective: understand what went wrong. Often nothing was wrong with you personally - someone was just better, or the company ran out of budget, or priorities changed. If you lack some skill, build a project to improve it.

## Handling Offers

Don't rush into agreeing immediately. If you have interviews with other companies, finish them first. Once you get the first offer, tell other companies about it to speed up their process. Having multiple offers is the ideal situation for negotiating salary and benefits. With just one offer, negotiation is difficult.

## Salary Negotiation

If you already named a salary number in the initial recruiter call and they offer that exact number, it's very hard to negotiate upward. Two approaches to the initial salary question:
- Say the number upfront - works well when you already know the market and have experience
- Postpone the conversation - works when entering a new field, relocating, or when you don't know the market yet

Regardless, do research and have a number in mind. Recruiters can be pushy and may not accept "let's talk later" as an answer.
